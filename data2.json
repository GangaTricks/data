[
  The Mesolithic Age
(9000 BC- 6000 BC)
● It was a transitional phase between the
Palaeolithic Age and the Neolithic Age.
● In this age, climate became warm and
dry, which brought about changes in
fauna and flora and made it possible for
human beings to move to new areas.
● The Mesolithic people lived on hunting,
fishing and food- gathering. At a later
stage, they also domesticated animals.
● The characteristic tools of the Mesolithic
Age are microliths. Microliths were small
tools made of stone pointed cresconic
blades, scrapers, etc made up of stones
were other important tools.
● Adamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and
Bagor in Rajasthan provide the earliest
evidence for the domestication of
animals.
● The people of Palaeolithic and
Mesolithic ages practiced painting.
Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh is a
striking site of Pre-historic painting of
Mesolithic age.
The Neolithic Age
(6000 BC-1800 BC)
● The people of this age are characterised
by the use of polished stone tools. They
particularly used stone axes.
● Important Neolithic sites in India
include Burzahom, Mehrgarh, Daojali
Hading, Chirand, Maski, Brahmagiri,
Hallur, Piklihal, Utnoor, Nagarjunakonda
and Paiyampalli.
● It is interesting that in Burzahom dogs
were buried with their masters in their
graves.
● The Neolithic settlers were the earliest
farming communities. They produced
ragi and horse-gram (kulathi). Neolithic
sites in Allahabad district are noted for
the cultivation of rice in the sixth
millenium BC. They domesticated
cattle, sheeps and goats. They wove
cotton and wool to make clothes.
● Hand made pottery and use of potter
wheel first appeared during the
Neolithic age.
● Neolithic men lived in caves and
decorated their walls with hunting and
dancing scenes. They knew the art of
making boats. In the later phase, people
lived a more settled life and lived in
circular and rectangular houses made of
mud and reed. Pit houses have been
found in Burzahom.
● Koldihwa in UP revealed a three
fold cultural sequence: Neolithic,
Chalcolithic and iron age. Mehargarh in
Baluchistan is the oldest Neolithic site
in India (7000 BC).
Chalcolithic Culture
(1800 BC-1000 BC)
● The end of the Neolithic period saw the
use of metals. Copper was the first metal
to be used.
● Chalcolithic culture refers to the
stone-copper phase. People also used
hand-axes and other objects made up of
copper ware.
● Chalcolithic people were primarily rural
communities. They domesticated
animals and practised agriculture. They
were not acquainted with burnt bricks
and lived in thatched houses. They
venerated the mother Goddess and
worshipped the bull.
● The people of Chalcolithic culture were
the first to use painted pottery. Black
and red pottery painted with white line
design was most popular.
● The Malwa ware is considered the
richest among the Chalcolithic
ceramics.
● Important chalcolithic sites in India are
Ahar, Jorwe, Kayatha, Malwa, Eran,
Rangpur, Navdatoli, Nevasa, Daimabad
and Inamgaon.
2 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● Indus civilisation is one of the four
earliest civilisations of the world along
with the civilisations of Mesopotamia
(Tigris and Euphrates), Egypt (Nile)
and China (Hwang Ho).
● The civilisation forms part of the
proto-history of India and belongs to the
Bronze age.
● In its mature form, the civilisation
lasted between 2600-1900 BC.
It can be divided into following sub-parts
● Early Phase 3500-2600 BC
● Middle (mature) Phase 2600-1900 BC
● Later Phase 1900-1400 BC
● Dayaram Sahni first discovered
Harappa in 1921.
● RD Banerjee discovered Mohenjodaro
or Mound of the Dead in 1922.
Nomenclature of Indus
Valley Civilisation
● Indus Valley Civilisation coined by
John Marshall as it flourished along the
Indus river.
● Harappan Civilisation after the first
discovered site, Harappa.
● Saraswati-Sindhu Civilisation as most
of the sites have been found along the
Indus-Saraswati river.
Geographical Spread
● The civilisation covered parts of Sind,
Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Punjab,
Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab
and Maharashtra.
● Mundigak and Shortughai are the two
sites located in Afghanistan.
● Western most site Sutkagendor on
Makran coast. Eastern most site
Alamgirpur in Uttar Pradesh.
● Northern most site Manda in Jammu
(River Chenab). Southern most site
Daimabad in Maharashtra (River
Pravara) are major sites.
Some New Discoveries
■ Ganverivala in Pakistan by Rafeeq Mugal.
■ Bhirrana oldest Harappan site has said to be
the mounds at Bhirrana village on the banks of
Ghaggar river.
■ Rakhigarhi in Haryana by Amarendra Nath.
Town Planning
● A unique feature was the grid system i.e.
streets cutting across one another at right
angles, dividing the town into large
rectangular blocks.

INDUS VALLEY CIVILISATION
● The towns were divided into two
parts: upper part or citadel and lower
part.
● The fortified citadel on the Western
side housed public buildings and
members of ruling class.
● Below the citadel on the Eastern side,
lay the lower town inhabited by the
common people.
● Underground Drainage System
connected all houses to the street
drains made of mortar, lime and
gypsum. They were covered with
either brick or stone slabs and
equipped with ‘Manhole’. This shows
developed sense of health and
sanitation.
● The Great Bath (Mohenjodaro) It
was used for religious bathing. Steps
at either end leads to the surface.
There were changing rooms
alongside.

bricks. They were often two or more
storeyed, with a square courtyard.
They had tiled bathrooms.

intervals. It indicates the existence of
street lighting.
Agriculture
● It was the backbone of the
civilisation. The soil was fertile due to
inundation in the river Indus and
flooding.

(World’s first ploughed field at
Kalibangan) and stone sickles for
harvesting. Iron was not known to
them.
● Gabarbands or nalas enclosed by
dams for storing water were a feature
in parts of Baluchistan. Canal
irrigation was absent.

DECLINE OF THE CIVILISATION
The Harappan culture flourished till about 1900 BC, then it began to decline. There is no
unanimity among historians, regarding the exact reason for the decline of this urban
civilisation. There are many different theories that show the decline of the Indus culture.

Original Home and
Identity
● The word Aryan literally means of
high birth.
● The location of the original
homeland of the Aryans is still
controversial, but the most
accepted theory is that they
migrated from Central Asia in
several groups between
2000-1500 BC and settled in
Eastern Afghanistan, modern
Pakistan and Punjab.
● This region is popularly known as
the land of seven rivers or ‘Sapta
Sindhu’ (the Indus, its five
tributaries i.e. Jhelum, Chenab,
Ravi, Beas and Sutlej and the
Saraswati).
Note The Central Asian theory is also
proved by the Boghazkai Inscription
(Turkey), which mentions four Vedic
Gods : Indra, Varuna, Mitra and
Nasatya.
Rigvedic or Early Vedic Period
(1500-1000 BC)
● Early Vedic people lived in the region of Sapta
Sindhu. They had knowledge of about 40 rivers
including Yamuna, Saraswati and Ganga.
Ocean was mentioned as Samudra, Himalaya
as Himvant, Hindu Kush as Munjavants and
desert as Dhawa.

THE ARYAN AND THE VEDIC AGE
● Aryans came into conflict with the
indigenous inhabitants called Dasas
(earlier branch of Aryans) and Dasyus
(Original inhabitants). Dasyuhatya or
slaughter of Dasyus is repeatedly
mentioned in the Rig Veda.
The Dasarajna War
(Battle of Ten Kings)
■ This battle was fought on the bank of the
Parushni river (Ravi). Sudas, the son of
Divodas and the Bharata king of Tritsu family
won over an alliance of ten tribes
(Five Aryans and Five non-Aryans).
■ The battle broke out due to a dispute between
Vashistha (priest of Bharatas) and
Visvamitra (priest of alliance).
Economy
● Rigvedic Aryans followed a mixed
economy consisting of both agriculture
and pastoralism.
● Pastoralism was their primary
occupation while agriculture was
secondary.
● They possessed better knowledge in
agriculture. Wooden ploughshare is
mentioned in Rig Veda. They were
acquainted with sowing, harvesting,
threshing and knew about different
seasons.
● Cow was the most important form of
wealth. The term for war in the Rig Veda
is Gavishthi or search for cows. The
horse was almost as important as cow.
● Cow was the standard unit of exchange.
Gold coins like Nishka, Krishna and
Satmana were also in use. Godhuli was
used as a measure of time and Gavyuti as
measure of distance.
Polity
● The king or Rajan was the head of the
tribal polity. Although his post was
hereditary, we have also some traces of
election by the tribal assembly called
‘Samiti’.
● Several tribal or clan based assemblies
existed such as the Sabha, Samiti,
Vidatha and Gana.
● The Samiti was the National Assembly
of the people, while the Sabha was
Council of Elders.
● King was assisted by many functionaries.
Most important functionary was the
Purohita, the religious advisor of the
king, followed by the Senani, the head of
the army.
● There was no regular system of taxation.
People gave voluntary offerings to the
king, called Bali.
● There was no regular or standing army.
However, there were groups of infantry
and charioteers.
● Weapons made of stone, wood, bone and
metal were used.
Society
● Kinship was the basis of society’s
structure. People gave their primary
loyalty to the tribe, which was called
Jana or Vis.
● Vis was divided into grama. When
grama clashed with one another, it
caused the Sangrama or war.
● Society was mostly Patriarchal.
Monogamy was prevalent. No evidence
of child marriage was found. Levirate
and widow remarriage was practised.
● Varna was the term used for colour of
people, which were classified into four
Varnas.
● Brahmins (teachers and priests),
Kshatriyas (rulers and administrators),
Vaishyas (Peasants, merchants and
bankers), Sudras (artisans and
labourers).
Rigvedic Gods
● Rigvedic people believed in nature
worship and not in erecting temples or
idol worship. They performed Yajnas in
open areas.
● Soma was considered to be the God of
plants and an intoxicating drink is
named after him.
● The ninth mandala of the Rig Veda i.e.
‘Soma Mandala’ is attributed to Soma.
● Important female divinities were
Aditi and Usha.

strengthened by rituals. The king performed
this sacrifice, which was supposed to confer
supreme power on him.
● Asvamedha—A king performed the
Asvamedha, which meant unquestioned
control over the area, in which the royal
horse ran uninterrupted.
● Vajapeya—A king performed the Vajapeya
or the chariot race, in which the royal
chariot was made to win the race against his
kinsmen.
LATER VEDIC AGE
(1000-600 BC)
(PAINTED GREYWARE
PHASE)
● Aryans expanded from Punjab to Western
UP covered by Ganga-Yamuna Doab
(Aryavarta).
● Later Vedic texts refer to rivers Narmada,
Sadanira, Chambal and Vindhya mountain.
Later Vedas gave three fold territorial
division of India into Aryavarta (Nothern
India), Madhyadesa (Central India) and
Dakshinapatha (Southern India).
● The expansion towards East is indicated in
a legend of Satapatha Brahmana i.e. how
Videha Madhava migrated from the
Saraswati region, crossed Sadanira and
came to the land of Videha (modern
Tirhut).
Polity
● Tribal assemblies lost their importance and
royal power increased at their cost. Vidhata
totally disappeared. Women were no longer
permitted to attend assemblies.
● Formation of large kingdoms, Kingship
became completely hereditary.
● The term Rashtra indicating territory, first
appeared in this period.
● Taittariya Brahmana refers to the theory of
divine origin of kingship.
● Satapatha Brahmana refers to
twelve Ratninas or civil functionaries of the
time.

● There was development of judiciary.
Kings administered the criminal
court. Serious crimes were the killing
of an embryo, homicide, the murder
of a Brahmin, stealing of gold and
drinking sura. Treason was a capital
offence.
Society
● The fourfold division of society
became more clear. Initially based on
occupation, it later became
hereditary.
● Brahmin—The growing cult of

warrior class.
● Vaisyas—They were the
agriculturalists, cattle rearers,
traders, artisans and metal workers.
● Shudras—Lowest in the social
hierarchy and born to serve the upper
three varna.
● The Ashram system was formed to
attain four purusharthas (Dharma,
Artha, Kama and Moksha). Jabala
Upanishada gives the earliest
reference to four ashramas i.e. the
stages of life—Brahmacharya,
Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sanyasa.
● Position of women declined. Aitareya
Brahmana states that daughter is the
source of misery while a son is the protector
of family. Maitrayani Samhita mentions
three evils—liquor, woman and dice.
Polygamy became frequent.
● However, some of the women had
got higher education as indicated by the
Yajnavalkya-Gargi dialogue in
Vrihadarnyaka Upanishada.
Economy
● Agriculture became the chief economic
activity. Manure was known. Wheat, rice,
barley, beans and Sesamum were cultivated.
● New occupational group emerged, such as
fisherman, washerman, dyers, doorkeepers and footmen.
● Tin, silver and iron was now known to the
people.
● Merchants were organised into Guilds, as
indicated by the terms-Ganas (corporations)
and Sresthins (aldermen).
● Characteristic pottery : Painted Grey
Ware.
Religion
● Rituals became important in the cult of
sacrifice.
● Prajapati became the supreme God. Vishnu
was conceived as the preserver and
protector of people.
● Pushan, responsible for well being of cattle,
became the God of Shudras.
● Towards the end of the Vedic age, a section
of society began to resent the priestly
domination.

● Ramayana written by Valmiki originally consisted of 6000 verses, which was raised to
12000 and finally 24000 verses.
Smritis
● Dharma Shastra is the other name for the Smritis, which are the law books written in
sloka form.
● The important Smritis are Manav Dharma Shastra, Vishnu Dharma Shastra,
Yajnavalkya Smriti and Narada Smriti.
● Manav Dharma Shastra or Manusmriti is the oldest and most famous. Manu is
supposed to be the first king and law maker.
● Later on, some minor Smritis and commentaries like the Mitakshara were compiled.
● The material advantages brought about by the use of the iron implements in Eastern
UP and Bihar in 6th century BC helped in the formation of large territorial states.
● Use of iron tools in agriculture produced surplus, which could be taxed by the princes
to finance their military and administrative needs.
● Thus, many Janapadas sprung up in the 6th century BC, the larger of which were
called Mahajanapadas.

submitted to Alexander. He got the
first and strongest resistance from
Porus.
● Alexander defeated Porus in the
Battle of Hydaspas on the banks of
the river Vitasta (Jhelum), but was
impressed by his bravery, so he
restored to Porus, his kingdom and
made him his ally.
● After the Battle of Sakala, Alexander
proceeded upto Beas with a view to
conquer the East, but his fatigued
army refused to cross the river.
● So, he was forced to retreat. He
placed the North-Western India
under the Greek Governor Selucus
Nikator.

and Sind, Boukephala in Jhelum.
● Alexander’s invasion paved the way
for the expansion of the Mauryan
empire in that area.
● His historians have left valuable
accounts related to Indian geography,
social and economic conditions,
which enable us to build the Indian
chronology of the times.
Pre-Mauryan Society
● Division of society into four classes
necessitated the formation of Dharmasutras.
● Shudras were ill-treated, while all privileges
were cornered by the Brahmanas and
Kshatriyas.
● Restrictions were imposed on women and
they were not entitled to education or the
Upanayana ceremony.

TURKISH INVASIONS
Mahmud of Ghazni
● Towards the close of the AD ninth
century, the vast empire of Arab broke
up and the Turks who got the
upperhand over the Khalifas of
Baghdad, established many
independant principalities. One of such
Turk state was founded by Alapigin
with Ghazni as his capital in about
AD 933.
● In those days, Punjab and the
North-West of India were ruled by
Jaipal of the Shahiya dynasty
(Hindustani). Subuktigin, the ruler of
Ghazni of that period, fought with
Jaipal and defeated him.
● Mahmud Ghaznavi was the eldest son
of Subuktigin, born in AD 971 and
ascended the throne in AD 998.
● For India, the only memory of Mahmud
is that of a plunderer and destroyer of
temples. Mahmud is said to have made
17 raids into India. The initial raids
were directed against the Hindustani
rulers. In AD 1001, the Hindustani
ruler Jaipal again was defeated by
Mahmud.
● His son Anandapala succeeded the
throne. A decisive battle between
Mahmud and Anandapala was fought in
AD 1008-09 at Waihind during his
sixth expedition.
● In other expeditions Mahmud
plundered Nagarkot, Thaneshwar,
Kannauj, Mathura and Somnath.
● He plundered Somnath temple in AD
1025 (his sixteenth raid).
● In AD 1026, Mahmud defeated the Jats.
He died in AD 1030. The objective of
Mahmud’s expeditions was to plunder
and loot. He was not interested in
expanding his empire to India.
MUHAMMAD GHORI
● The Ghaznavi state was no longer a
powerful state after Mahmud Ghazni. His
successors were weak which resulted into
the emergence of a Seljuk empire. But
towards the middle of the 12th century,
another group of Turkish tribe man
shattered the power of the Seljuk Turks.
● The power of the Ghurids increased
under Sultan Alauddin, who earned the
title the World burner, because he
ravaged Ghazni and burnt it into the
ground.
● In 1173, Muizzudin Muhammad
(Muhammad Ghori) ascended the throne
at Ghazni, while his elder brother was
ruling at Ghur. Muizzudin Muhammad
conquered Multan and Kutch.
● In 1178, he attempted to penetrate into
Gujarat by marching across the
Rajputana desert, but was completely
rooted out by the Gujarat ruler.
● He realised the necessity of creating a
suitable base in Punjab before venturing
upon the conquest of India. He
conquered Peshawar, Lahore and
Sialkot.
● At that period, the Chauhan power had
been steadily growing. Chauhans had
captured Delhi from the Tomars around
the middle of the century.
● At the age of 11, Prithviraj ascended the
throne at Ajmer and began a career of
conquest. He invaded the Chandellas of
Bundelkhand in a battle near Mahoba.
42
Quick Digest
■ Mahmud is considered as a hero of Islam by
medieval Muslim historians because of his
stout defence against the Central Asian Turkish
tribal invaders.
■ Secondly, because he was closely associated
with the renaissance of the Iranian spirit.
■ A high water mark in the Iranian renaissance
was reached with Firdausi’s Shah Namah.
■ He patronised three persons, contemporary to
him: Firdausi (court poet), Alberuni (scholar)
and Utbi (court historian).
■ Alberuni wrote ‘Kitab-ul-Hind’.
ARAB CONQUEST OF SIND
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● Both Prithviraj and Muhammad Ghori’s
attention towards the Punjab and Ganga
valley brought the two ambitious rulers
into conflict. In the First Battle of
Terrain (1191) the Ghori forces were
completely rooted out by Prithviraj.
● It is said that Jaichand, the ruler of
Kannauj (Gahadavala kingdom) did not
help Prithviraj during the Second battle
of Terrain because Prithviraj had
abducted, Jaichand’s daughter
Sanyogita, who was in love with him.
● Prithviraj Raso, written by court poet
of Prithviraj, Chand Bardai, the depicts
the life story of Prithviraj and his love
story.
● The defeat laid the foundation of
Muslim rule in India.
● Later on in 1194, Jaichand of Kannauj
was also defeated at the Battle of
Chandawar.
● Bakhtiyar Khilji one of Ghori’s
commanders, annexed Bihar and
Bengal and destroyed Nalanda and
Vikramshila Universities.
● Muhammad Ghori died in AD 1206,
leaving the charge with Qutub-ud-din
Aibak.
● The Sultanate of Delhi had five ruling
dynasties with 34 kings.
Battle of Terrain
■ The Second Battle of Terrain (1192) is regarded
as one of the turning point in Indian history.
The better organised and well prepared
Turkish force defeated the Indian forces.
■ Prithviraj was defeated by Muhammad Ghori.
Prithviraj was allowed to rule over Ajmer for
sometime. But was executed on a charge of
conspiracy after some time.
Causes of the Turkish Success
● Political disunity among Rajput and
internal rivalries.
● No Central Government.
● Unguarded frontiers, even after repeated
attacks.
● Organised military and ambitious Turkish
invaders.
43
THE ILBARI OR SLAVE
DYNASTY (1206-1290)
● After Muhammad Ghori’s death, all the
Muslim rulers who ruled over India from
AD 1206-1290 were either slaves or were
descendants of the slave ruler. So, the
Dynasty is generally known as the Slave
Dynasty.
● The dynasty is also called Ilbari Dynasty,
as all the rulers of this dynasty except
Aibak belonged to the Ilbari tribe of
Turks.
Qutubuddin Aibak
(1206-1210)
● Originally a slave, Qutubuddin, because
of his merit and loyal service was rose to
the post of Viceroy by Muhammad Ghori.
After Ghori’s death, Aibak ruled over
Delhi and founded his dynasty.
● Lahore and later, Delhi was his capital.
● For his generosity, he was given the title
of Lakh Baksh.

themselves to the idea of a woman ruling
over them and so they placed one of his
son Rukunuddin Firoz on the throne. He
was a worthless person who left the work
of the government in the hand of his
mother, Shah Turkan.

he was out of the capital to curb a
rebellion in Awadh against him.

Abwabs or Cessess.
Transfer of the Capital (1327)

The Sufi Movement
Mystics who are called Sufis, rose in Islam at a very early stage.
● These saints had nothing to do with the state. They laid great emphasis on love as a
bond between God and the individual soul.
● Sufi came out of the word sooph meaning wool. They advocated life of purity and
renunciation. Sufism sprang from the doctrine of Wahadat-ul-Wujud or unity of being.
This doctrine was propounded by Ibn-ul-Arabi.
● One and the earliest Sufis was Rabia, a woman.
● Sufis organised 12 orders or silsilas. A silsila was generally led by a prominent mystic,
who lived in a khanqah or hospice alongwith his disciple. The link between the teacher
or pir and his disciples or murids was a vital part of Sufism. Every pir nominated a
successor or wali to carry out his work.
● Sufi orders are broadly divided into Ba-shara that is those which followed the Islamic
law (shariat) and Be-shara, that is those which were not bound by it.

● Under him, the Mughal empire
reached its greatest extent and the
largest single state ever known in
India.

Revolts under Aurangzeb
● Aurangzeb’s rule can be broadly
divided into two periods, in the first
23 years, he concentrated in the
North, when Maratha power under
Shivaji emerged and the second
period (1682-1707) is marked by his
pre-occupations with the affairs of
Deccan.
● Sikhs In 1675, he ordered the arrest
and execution of the ninth Sikh
Guru, Guru Tegh Bhadur. Against
this, Guru Gobind Singh organised
his followers into a military force
called Khalsa, but he was also

at Nanded in Deccan. Later, Banda
Bairagi continued the war against
Mughals.

AD 1686 and AD 1687, respectively.
● Ahoms In 1662, Mir Jumla Aurangzeb’s
ablest general led the expedition against
Ahoms.
Religious Policy of Aurangzeb
Aurangzeb was a Sunni orthodox Muslim, who
wanted to convert India from Dar-ul-Harb to
Dar-ul-Islam. His religious policy was a
departure from the policy of tolerance and
universal peace followed by Akbar. He replaced
the solar calender by the lunar Hira, dismissed
court musicians and royal painters, appointed
Muhtasibts (court sensors) from amongst the
Ulema, to enforce sharia’t.
Causes of the Fall of
the Mughal Empire
■ Weak and incompetent successors.
■ Wars of succession.
■ Aurangzeb’s Deccan, religious and Rajput
policies.
■ Jagirdari crisis.
■ Growth of Marathas and other regional powers.

Grand-Trunk. He also built his tomb at
Sasaram in Bihar.
● Malik-Muhammad Jayasi wrote
Padmavat (Hindi) during his reign.
● Tarikh-i-Shershahi was written by
Abbas Khan Sarwani, his court historian.
Shivaji (1674-80)
● Shivaji belonged to the Bhonsle Clan of
Marathas. Shivaji’s father Shahji
Bhonsle was a military commander
under Nizam Shahi ruler of
Ahmednagar.
● Shivaji was born to Jijabai in the hill
fortress of Shivner. Shivaji’s early career
and life was influenced by Jijabai, his
mother, Dadaji Kondadev, the manager
of his father’s Jagir and Guru Ramdas,
his spiritual teacher.
● Dadaji Kondadev gave him training in
civil and military administration.
● Before that, in 1646, he conquered the
fort of Torna and built forts at Raigarh
and Pratapgarh. In 1647, he assumed
full charge of his Jagir.
● In 1659, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan,
Ambassador of Ali Adil Shah (Sultan of
Bijapur), in a meeting with his tiger
paws. The Sultan then acknowledged the
independent status of Shivaji.
● Later, Shaista Khan, a Governor of
Deccan, was deputed by Aurangzeb to
put down the rising power of Shivaji in
1660. Shivaji lost Poona and suffered
several defeats, till he made a bold attack
on Shaista’s military camp at night and
plundered Surat and later Ahmednagar.
● Raja Jai Singh of Amber was then
appointed by Aurangzeb to put down
Shivaji (1665) and Jai Singh succeeded
in besieging Shivaji in the fort of
Purandhar. Consequently, the Treaty of
Purandhar (1665) was signed according
to which, Shivaji ceded some forts to the
Mughals and paid a visit to the Mughal
court at Agra. Shivaji also agreed to help
Mughals in their attack on Bijapur.

Shambhaji in 1666. He was put on house
arrest but escaped from there.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● He was crowned in 1674 at Raigarh and
assumed the title of Haindava
Dharmodharak (protector of Hinduism)
and Chhatrapati. He became the sovereign
ruler of Maharashtra. He died in 1680.
Shivaji’s Administration
● Shivaji divided the territories under his rule
into three provinces (prants), each under a
Viceroy. Provinces were divided into Prants,
which were subdivided into Parganas or
Tarafs. The lowest unit was village, headed
by a headman or patel.
● Shivaji was helped by Ashtapradhan (eight
ministers), which was unlike a Council of
Ministers, for there was no collective
responsibility. Each minister was directly
responsible to Shivaji.
● His administrative reforms were guided by
Malik Amber of Ahmednagar.
Shivaji’s Revenue
Administration
● Assessment of land revenue was based on
measurement. The Kathi of Amber was
adopted as the unit of measurement.
● Chauth was one-fourth of the land revenue
paid to the Marathas so as not to be
subjected to Maratha’s raid.
● Sardeshmukhi was an additional levy of 10
per cent (1/10th) on those lands of
Maharashtra, over which the Marathas
claimed hereditary right, but which formed
part of the Mughal empire.
MARATHAS AFTER
SHIVAJI
● There was a dispute of succession
between Sambhaji and Rajaram.
● Son of Shivaji, Sambhaji (1680-89)
succeeded the throne. He was an
incapable ruler and poor diplomat.
● Prince Akbar, the rebellious son of
Aurangzeb took shelter with him.
Sambhaji was executed by Aurangzeb
and his infant son, Shahu, was taken
captive by Aurangzeb. Sambhaji was
succeeded by Rajaram in 1689.
● Rajaram (1689-1700) was killed in
1700 by Aurangzeb. His widow
Tarabai put her infant son, Shivaji II,
on the throne. Rajaram created the
new Ministerial post of Pratinidhi.
Thus, total number of ministers
became nine.
● After Aurangzeb’s death in 1707,
Shahu, the grandson of Shivaji and
son of Sambhaji was released by
Bahadur Shah. He claimed the
throne and this led to a civil war
between Shahu and Tarabai. Shahu
emerged victorious in the Battle of
Khed, with the help of Balaji
Vishwanath. After this, Shahu ruled
from Satara and Tarabai from
Kolhapur. From now onwards, the
rule of Peshwa started. They became
virtual rulers of the state.

ECONOMIC AND
COMMERCIAL
POLICY
The ‘gradual development of Economic
and Commerical Policy has been traced
through three stages of British
colonialism by RP Dutta.
Phases of Economic Policy
Early Phase (1600-1757)
The East India Company was purely a
trading company, dealing with import of
goods and precious metals into India and
export of spices and textiles.
Mercantile Phase (1757-1813)
They imposed their own prices and had
no relation with the cost of production.
The Company used its political power and
monopolised trade and dictated terms to
the weavers of Bengal. The Company
used revenue of Bengal to finance exports
of Indian goods.
Industrial Phase (1813-1858)
The British mercantile industrial
capitalist class exploited India. Charter
Act of 1813, allowed ‘one way free trade’
for British citizens resulting in Indian
markets flooded with cheap and machine
made imported goods from Britain.
Indians not only lost their foreign markets
but their Indian markets also.
Finance Imperialism
(1858 Onwards)
This phase saw export of capital from
India and also chains of British controlled
banks, export import firms and managing
agency houses. Exploitation through
railways is the best example of finance
Imperialism.
Drain of Wealth Theory
● ‘‘Drain of Wealth’’ refers to a portion of
National Product of India, which was not
available for consumption of its own
people.
● Dadabhai Naoroji first cited the drain of
wealth theory in his book titled Poverty
and Un-British Rule in India.
● RC Dutt blamed the British policy for
Indian economic ills in his book Economic
History of India.
● Drain of wealth began in 1757 after Battle
of Plassey. In 1765, the company acquired
the diwani of Bengal and began the
purchase of Indian goods out of the
revenue of Bengal and exported them.
These purchases were known as
Company’s investments.
LAND REVENUE
SYSTEMS
Permanent Settlement
● Introduced in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa,
districts of Banaras and Northern
districts of Madras by Lord Cornwallis in
1793.
● John Shore planned this settlement.
● Assured of their ownership, many
zamindars stayed in towns and exploited
their tenants.
● It declared zamindars as the owners of the
land. Hence, they could keep 1/11th of the
revenue collected to themselves while the
British got a fixed share of 10/11th of the
revenue collected. The zamindars were
free to fix the rate.
Ryotwari Settlement
● Introduced in Bombay, Madras and
Assam. Munro and Charles Reed
recommended it.
● In this, the direct settlement was made
between the Government and the Ryots.
● The revenue was based on the basis of the
quality of the soil and the nature of the
crop. The revenue was fixed for a period
not exceeding 30 years. It was based on
the ‘Scientific Rent Theory of Ricardo.’
● The position of the cultivator became
more secure.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
Mahalwari System
● Introduced in the area of Ganga
valley, North-West Frontier Provinces
parts of Central India and Punjab.
● Revenue Settlement was to be made
by village or estates with landlords.
A settlement was made with the village,
which maintained a form of common
ownership known as Bhaichara or with
Mahals, which were group of villages.
Revenue was periodically revised.
CAUSES OF THE
REVOLT
● Political Nana Sahib was refused
pension as he was the adopted son of
Peshwa Baji Rao-II to lead the revolt at
Kanpur.
● Awadh (Lucknow) was annexed
in 1856, on charge of
maladministration and Jhansi was
annexed owing to the Doctrine of
Lapse.
Military Discrimination
Indian soldiers were paid low salaries,
they could not rise above the rank of
Subedar and were racially insulted.
Religious Discrimination
The social reforms by British was against
the people’s will (widow remarriage,
abolition of sati, school for girls,
Christian missionaries etc). Soldiers
were asked to use the Enfield Rifles with
greased (by pork or beef) cartridges.
Economic Grievances
Heavy taxations, discriminatory tariff
policy; destruction of traditional
handicrafts that hit peasants, artisans
and small zamindars.
Outbreak of the Revolt
● Bengal Resentment in which 19
native infantries of Behrampur,
refused to use the newly introduced
Enfield Rifle.
● Mangal Pandey 34th native infantry
fired at the sergeant major of his
regiment. Known as a part of Mutiny of
Barrackpur.
● Mangal Pandey was hanged.
● On 10th May, 1857, the sepoys at Meerut
refused to use Enfiled Rifles and revolted.
The mutiny spread throughout Uttar
Pradesh and sepoys moved to Delhi crying
March to Delhi.
● At Delhi, Bahadur Shah II was
declared ‘Shahenshah-i-Hindustan.’
● Where the rulers were loyal to the British,
the soldiers revolted as in Gwalior and
Indore. In some places, people revolted
before the sepoys.
● In the beginning, the rebels were
successful. Europeans were killed, police
stations and law courts were attacked and
revenue records were destroyed. But, the
revolt was soon suppressed.
Centres of Revolt and
their Leaders
■ Delhi Bahadur Shah II, General Bakht Khan
■ Kanpur Nana Sahib/Dhondhu Pant (adopted
son of Baji Rao-II) Tantia Tope, Azimullah khan
■ Jhansi Rani Lakshmi Bai
■ Lucknow Begum Hazrat Mahal, her son Birjis
Qadir.
■ Faizabad Maulavi Ahamdullah
■ Bareilley Khan Bahadur Khan
■ Bihar (Arrah) Kunwar Singh, Zamindar of
Jagdishpur.
Suppression of the Revolt
● John Lawrence remarked, ‘‘Had a single
leader of ability arisen among them we
must have been lost beyond redemption.’’
Delhi was captured on 20th September,
1857 by John Nicholson and Bahadur
Shah II was deported to Rangoon, where
he died in 1862. His sons were shot dead at
Delhi.

adopted a child in 1853 but Lord Dalhousie
wished to annex Jhansi under the Doctrine of
Lapse. Rani did not surrender and died fighting at
Kalpi near Jhansi during the Revolt of 1857.
Causes Behind the Failure of
the Revolt
● Lack of unity and poor organisation of the
revolt. All the classes of the society were
not effected or participated in the revolt.
● Lack of common motive for participating
in the revolt. Some of the rulers like
Scindhias, Nizam and Holkars helped
Britishers in reppressing the revolt.
● The military equipments of rebels were
inferior.
● The most significant feature of the
revolt was the exhibition of
Hindu–Muslim Unity.
● Concentrated on the Northern part of
India.
Impacts of the Revolt
● In August 1858, the British Parliament
passed an Act, which put an end to the
rule of the Company. The
responsibility of the administration of
British India passed into the hands of
the British Queen and the Parliament.
● An office of the Secretary of State for
India with a 15 members’ council was
constituted for the administration of
India.
● The designation of the GovernorGeneral was changed to Viceroy, who
was to act as a representative.
● ‘Doctrine of Lapse’ was withdrawn.
Princely states were assured against
annexation.
● The British pursued the divide and
rule policy.

soldiers in the army.
● Total expense of the suppression was
borne by the Indians.

● Initially, the East India Company was not
interested in the development of
education. Some minor exceptions were
efforts by individuals.
● The Calcutta Madrasa established by
Warren Hastings in 1781, for the study of
Muslim law.
● The Sanskrit College established by
Jonathan Duncan at Banaras in 1791, for
the study of Hindu law and philosophy.
● Fort William College established by
Wellesley in AD 1800, for training of Civil
Servants of the Company in Indian
languages and customs (closed in AD
1802).
Second Phase (1813-1853)
● For the first time, the British Parliament
included in 1813 Charter, a clause under
which the Governor-General-in-Council
was bound to keep a sum not less than one
lakh rupees, for education. However, the
company used this fund for promoting
Indian language and literature.
● The charter allowed the Christian
missionaries to spread their religious ideas
in India.
● The greatest importance of the 1813 Act
was that the Company, for the first time,
acknowledged state responsibility for
promotion of education in India.
● Establishment of Calcutta College in 1817
with the efforts of Raja Ram Mohan Roy
for imparting Western education. Three
Sanskrit colleges were set-up at Calcutta.
● In 1823, a General Committee of Public
Instruction was appointed to look after the
development of education in India, but
failed due to Orientalist-Anglicist
controversy over the nature of education
i.e. traditional or Western and the medium
of instruction.
● The controversy was settled by
Macaulay’s Education Policy 1835,
which was approved by Lord William
Bentinck. The policy favoured English
education to a traditional one.
● In 1844, Lord Hardinge decided to give
government employment to Indians
educated in English schools. This
further boosted the Western education
in India.
● Bethune school was founded by JED
Bethune at Calcutta (1849),
Agricultural Institute at Pusa
(Bihar) and Engineering Institute at
Roorkee.
Third Phase (1854-1900)
● In 1854, Charles Wood prepared a
despatch on an Educational System
for India, which came to be called the
Magna Carta of Education in the
country. According to Wood’s scheme
(i) The government needed to spread
Western education through English
medium for higher education. But
Vernacular primary schools should
be set-up in rural areas.
(ii) A grants-in-aid system to
encourage private enterprises
involvement in education.
(iii) A department of public instruction
to be set-up in each of the five
provinces.
(iv) Universities in Calcutta (1857),
Bombay (1857) and Madras (1857)
were established.
(v) Teacher’s training institutions.
(vi) Promotion of Education for
Women.
● Most of Wood's proposals were
implemented, which led to
Westernisation of the Indian
Educational System.

Moderate Phase, (1885-1905)
● Development and consolidation of
feeling of national unity irrespective of
race, caste, religion or province.
● Peaceful constitutional agitations,
prayer and petitions were the
instruments of work.
● They succeeded in passing the Indian
Councils Act of 1892, which allowed
some members to be indirectly elected
by Indians, but keeping the official
majority intact.

opinion to introduce reforms in India.
Extremist Phase (1905-17)
Cause for the Rise of Extremists
● Dissatisfaction with the methods and
achievements of moderates.
● Growing consciousness about the
exploitative character of the British
rule. Loss of Britain in the Boer wars
(1899-1902) demolished the myth of
whiteman supremacy.
● Reactionary policies of CurzonUniversity Act (1904), Indian Official
Secrets Act (1904) to restrict freedom
of press and partition of Bengal.
● Extremists gave the idea of India’s
independence the central place in
India’s politics.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 89
THE INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT
Methods of the Extremists
● Promotion of Swadeshi and Boycott of
foreign goods. Non-Co-operation with
Britishers (Passive Resistance).
Extremist leaders- Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal
Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Sir

T Prakasham and Chidambaram Pillai.
● They want to take the movement outside
Bengal.
Partition of Bengal
● Through a royal proclamation, Lord
Curzon ordered Partition of Bengal
creating East Bengal and Assam out of rest
of Bengal on 16th October, 1905.
● The objective was to set up a communal
gulf between the Hindus and Muslims.
● The Indian National Movement entered its
second phase after the Partition of Bengal.
● The British said that the existing province
of Bengal was too big to be efficiently
administered by a single Provincial
Government.
● The Indian National Congress and the
nationalists of Bengal firmly opposed the
Partition. Within Bengal, different sections
of population— zamindars, merchants,
lawyers, students and even women rose up
in spontaneous opposition to the partition of
their province.
● Divide and Rule The nationalists could
see that it was a deliberate attempt to
divide the Bengal’s territory on religious
grounds as for Eastern part Muslims will
be in majority and for the Western part,
the Hindus.
● Rabindranath Tagore composed the
National Song Amar Sonar Bangla for the
occasion. This song was adopted as
National Anthem by Bangladesh in 1971,
after its liberation from Pakistan.
The Anti-Partition Movement
● The Anti-Partition movement was initiated
on 7th August, 1905. On that day, a
massive demonstration against the

The Swadeshi and Boycott
(1905-1908)
● It had its origin in the Anti-Partition
movement of Bengal. Mass meetings
were held all over Bengal, where
Swadeshi or the use of Indian goods
and the boycott of British goods were
proclaimed and pledged. Public
burning of foreign cloth were organised
and shops selling foreign cloths were
picketed.
● An important aspect of the Swadeshi
Movement was the emphasis placed on
self reliance or Atmashakti.
● Acharya PC Roy organised his famous
Bengal Chemical Swadeshi stores.
● The Swadeshi Movement had several
consequences like flowering of
nationalist poetry, journalism,
self-reliant and opening many national
educational institutions.
● Nationalist Educational Institutions
were founded e.g., Bengal Technical
Institute, Bengal National College.
● BC Pal and Chidambram Pillai led
Vandemataram Movement in Madras.
● Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh led the
movement in Punjab. Syed Haider
Raza led the movement in Delhi.
Why Swadeshi Movement
Failed?
● Severe government repression.
● Split in nationalists at Surat.
● Lack of effective organisation.
● The movement was rendered
leaderless.
Formation of Muslim League

like that of United Kingdom was the goal of
Indian people.
SURAT SPLIT (1907)
● The INC splited into two groups during
the session at Surat in 1907. Extremists
were led by Lal, Bal, Pal, while
Moderates were led by GK Gokhale.
Moderates
● They demanded mild constitutional
reforms, economic relief,
administrative reorganisation and
protection of civil rights.
Extremists
● They were dissatisfied with the
achievement of the moderates. They
realised that the true nature of British
was exploitative.
● There were 3 groups of extremists The
Maharashtrian group (headed by Bal
Gangadhar Tilak), the Bengal group
(represented by BC Pal and Aurobindo)
and the Punjab group (led by Lala
Lajpat Rai).
● Aurobindo published New lamps for
old in the Indu Prakash in 1893-94. It
was the first systematic critique of the
moderates.
Indian Councils Act of 1909
or the-Morley Minto
Reforms
● Number of elected members in the
imperial and provincial legislative
councils increased. Separate
electorates introduced for Muslims.
● Non-official members to be elected
indirectly. Thus, election introduced for
the first time.

and Sohan Singh Bakhna.
● The war period witnessed the growth of
revolutionary movement not only in India,
but outside India as well, by the Indians.
● Indian revolutionary in the United States
of America and Canada had established
the Ghadar (Rebellion) Party in 1913.
Most of the members of the party were
Punjabi Sikh peasants and ex-soldiers,
who migrated.
● The party was built around the weekly
paper ‘The Ghadar’, which carried the
caption Angrezi raj ka Dushman.
● Headquarters were at San Francisco.
● The outbreak of the first World War
provided the Ghadarites with an
opportunity to free India from a
government, which was indifferent to
their cause.
● They began to return India in thousands
for a revolt, but unfortunately the
authorities came to know about their
plans and took immediate action. The
rebellious regiments were disbanded and
their leader were either imprisoned or
hanged.
● Some of the prominent Ghadar leaders
were—Baba Gurumukh Singh, Kartar
Singh Saraba, Sohan Singh Bakhna,
Rahmat Ali Shah, Bhai Paramanand and
Mohammad Barkatullah.
● To carry out other revolutionary activities,
‘‘Swadesh Sevak Home’’ at Vancouver and
United India House at Seattle was set-up.

and tried to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh from
91
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
among them. Police opened fire on
them and 19 passengers died in the
incident.
Home Rule Movement
(1916)
● After Tilak’s return, having served
sentence of six years in Mandlay, he
tried securing the readmission of
himself and other extremists into the
Indian National Congress. With the
need being felt for popular pressure to
attain concessions, disillusionment with
Morley-Minto reforms and wartime
miseries, Tilak and Annie Besant
readied to assume leadership.
● The Home Rule League was pioneered
on lines of a similar movement in
Ireland. Muslim League supported the
movement. Its objective was to work for
social and political reforms.
Tilak’s Home Rule
Movement
● It started in April, 1916 at Poona. Tilak’s
league was to work in Maharashtra,
Karnataka, Central Province and Berar
excluding Bombay. Tilak linked up the
question of Swaraj with the demand for
the formation of linguistic states and
education in Vernacular language.
● He gave the slogan “Swaraj is my birth
right and I shall have it.’’ Tilak’s
newspapers Maratha and Kesari were
organs for home rule.
Annie Besant’s Home Rule
Movement
● Started with George Arundale as
Secretary at Adyar in September, 1916.
Annie Besant's league worked in rest of
India.
● Annie Besant’s newspapers New India
and Commonweal became important
for this movement. She coined the term
Commonwealth.
● Many moderate nationalists, who were
dissatisfied with the Congress inactivity,
joined home rule agitation. In June
1917, Annie Beasant was arrested,
popular pressure forced the government
to release her in September, 1917.
Lucknow Session of the
Congress (1916)
● Presided by a moderate Ambika Charan
Majumdar. The growing nationalist
feeling in the country produced two
historic developments at the Lucknow
Session of the Indian National Congress
in 1916. Firstly-the two wings of the
Congress were reunited, i.e., brought
about an union of moderates and
extremists.
● Secondly at Lucknow, the Congress and
the All India Muslim League sank their
old differences and put up a common
political demand for representative
government and dominion status, before
the government. Congress accepted the
separate electorates. This led to
Congress-League Pact.
Montague Declaration (1917)
● A British policy was announced after the
Lucknow pact, which came to be known
as the August Declaration. It aimed at
‘‘increasing association of Indians in
every branch of the administration for
progressive realisation of responsible
government in India. The declaration
formed the basis of
Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, of
1919.
Rowlatt Act (1919)
● In 1919, a Sedition Committee headed
by Justice Rowlatt led to the Rowlatt
Act. This act authorised the government
to imprison any person without trial and
conviction by the Court of Law for 2
years. The law also enabled the
government to suspend the right of
Habeas Corpus, which had been the
foundation of Civil Liberties in Britain. It
led to a countrywide agitation and
marked the foundation of
Non-Cooperation Movement.
● During March and April 1919, the
country witnessed a remarkable political
awakening. There were hartals, strikes,
processions and demonstrations.
92
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
Gandhi’s Return to India

First Non-Cooperation Movement. Due
to failure of crops, the farmers, with
Gandhi, withheld the revenue to get
remission based on revenue code.
Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
(13th April, 1919)
● The dissatisfaction against Rowlatt Act
led to mass agitations. A large but
unarmed crowd had gathered on 13th
April, 1919 at Amritsar (Punjab) in
the Jallianwala Bagh, to protest
against the arrest of their popular
leaders Dr Saif-ud-din Kitchlew and
Dr Satyapal.
● General Dyer, the Military
Commander of Amritsar, decided to
terrorise the people of Amritsar into
complete submission. Jallianwala

with his troops and then ordered his
men to shoot into the crowd.
Thousands were killed and wounded.

inquire into it.
● On 13th March, 1940, Sardar Udham
Singh killed Dyer, when the latter was
addressing a meeting in Coxton Hall,
London.
The Khilafat Movement
(1920-1922)
● During the first World War, Turkey allied
with Germany and Austria against British.
The Indian Muslim regarded the Sultan of
Turkey as their spiritual leader, Khalifa.
● After the war, the British removed the
Khalifa from his power and fragmented
Turkey. Hence, the Muslim started the
Khilafat Movement in India, for the
restoration of Khalifa’s position.
● The leaders were Ali brothers (Shaukat Ali
and Mohammed Ali), Maulana Azad,
Hakim Ajmal Khan and Hasrat Mohani.
Gandhi saw this as an opportunity to bring
about Hindu-Muslim unity against the
British, although CR Das opposed it
initially.
● The Central Khilafat Committee met at
Allahabad. The meeting was attended by
number of Congress and Khilafat leaders. In
this meeting, a programme of
non-cooperation towards the government
was declared. This included boycott of
titles conferred by the government, boycott
of civil services, army and police, i.e., of all
government services.
Non-Cooperation Movement
(1920-1922)
● It was the first mass based political
movement under Gandhi.
● The decision to not cooperate in the most
peaceful manner with the government and
its laws, was endorsed at the annual session
of the Congress held at Nagpur, in 1920.
The Nagpur Session also made changes in
the Constitution of the Congress.
● Anti-Rowlatt agitation, Jallianwala Bagh
tragedy, Khilafat Movement, general
economic distress during and after the war
were the reasons for Non-Cooperation
Movement.
● The Tilak Swarajya Fund started
financing the Non-Cooperation Movement.
The movement envisaged boycott of
school, colleges, law courts, foreign cloth
and advocated the use of Charkha.
93
● Boycott of the forthcoming visit of Prince
of Wales in November, 1921.
● Popularisation of Charkha and Khadi
and Jail Bharo by Congress volunteers.
● The movement demanded-Swaraj or
self rule and Redressal of the Punjab
wrongs and Khilafat issue.
● Lala Lajpat Rai organised educational
Boycott in Punjab.
● CR Das, C Rajagopalachari, Saif-ud-din
Kitchlew, VB Patel, Aruna Asaf Ali and
Motilal Nehru gave up their legal
practice.
● The Congress Session at Allahabad in
December, 1921 decided to launch a
Civil Disobedience Movement. But
before it could be launched, the angry
peasants (mob) attacked on a police
station at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur
district of Uttar Pradesh on 5th February,
1922. This changed the whole situation
and Gandhiji was compelled to withdraw
the Non-Cooperation Movement.
Spread of Non-Cooperation
Movement
● United Province became a strong base
for the Non-Cooperation Movement.
● Agrarian-riots under the leadership of
Baba Ramchandra, Eka Movement
under Madari Pasi.
● In Punjab–Akali Movement for reform
and control of Gurudwaras.
● In Andhra Pradesh, the NonCooperation Movement was a great
success. Alluri Sitaram Raju organised
the tribals in Andhra and combined their
demands with those of the
Non-Cooperation Movement.
The Swarajists
● Major developments in Indian politics
occurred during 1922–28. Differences
arose among leaders after the
withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation
Movement. One school of thought
headed by CR Das and Motilal Nehru

Session in 1927, presided over by Dr
Ansari.
● The Muslim League and Hindu
Mahasabha decided to support the

that it could attend the Round Table
Conference.
● Moderate statesman Jaikar, Sapru and
Srinivas Shastri initiated efforts to break
the ice between Gandhiji and the government.
The negotiation between Irwin and Gandhi in
5th March, 1931 came to be known
Gandhi-Irwin Pact or known Delhi Pact.
Gandhi-Irwin Pact
■ Under this pact, the government agreed to release
all those political prisoners, who had remained
non-violent. The Right to make salt for consumption
was agreed to.
■ The Congress was to suspend Civil Disobedience
Movement and take part in Second Round Table
Conference.

Fundamental Right and National Economic
Programme, with the efforts of Jawaharlal
Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose.

Second Round Table Conference
(1931)
● Gandhiji went to England in September, 1931,
along with Sarojini Naidu, Mahadev Desai, GD
Birla and Madan Mohan Malviya to attend the
Second Round Table Conference. But the
British Government refused to concede the
basic nationalist demand for freedom on the
basis of the immediate grant of dominion
status with complete control over defence,
external affairs and finance.
● On his return, Gandhiji resumed the Civil
Disobedience movement in 1932 and finally
withdrew it in 1934.
Poona Pact (Communal
Award) (1932)
● McDonald announced the proposal
on minority representation, known
as the Communal Award in 1932.
Under this the depressed classes
(Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians,
Anglo Indians, Women and
Backward Classes) were to be
considered as a minority, would be
entitled to the right of separate
electorate. Gandhi reacted strongly
to the proposal. He considered the
depressed class as the integral part
of Hindu society.
● He thought that there was no need
to protect the depressed classes
through representation, rather the
need was to eradicate
untouchability.
● Gandhi restored to fast unto death
in Yervada Jail (Poona) against this
separate electorate for depressed
class, which Ambedkar was
insisting on. This resulted into the
Poona-Pact between Gandhi and
Ambedkar on 25th September,
1932.
● 147 seats were to be alloted to the
depressed classes in the provincial
legislature as against 71 provided

for depressed classes and their
upliftment became his prime
concern. All India Anti
Untouchability League was started
in September, 1932. On 8th May,
1933 Gandhiji decided to begin a
21 day fast for self purification for

● The Congress did not participate.
● The discussion led to Government of
India Act, 1935.
Government of India
Act, 1935
● The discussions of the Third Round
Table Conference and Simon
Commission report eventually led to the
passing of the Goverment of India Act of
1935. The act provided for the
establishment of an All India Federation
and a new system of government for the
Provinces on the basis of provincial
autonomy.
● It abolished the Council of India,
established by the Government of India
Act, 1858.
● The act provided for a Federal Court and
a Federal Bank.

demanded the convening of a
constitutional assembly elected on the
basis of adult franchise to frame a
Constitution for independent India.
Second World War
● Lord Linlithgow declared India to be at
war without the prior assent of the
Central Legislature. The Congress
Ministry resigned in the wake of the war.
● Congress agreed to support Britain only
in return of independence being granted.
The viceroy could promise this only after
the war. In October-November 1939, the
Congress Ministries resigned in protest.
The Muslim League observed this as the
Deliverence Day (22nd December,
1939). The Satyagraha was kept limited
so as not to embarass Britain’s war effort
by a mass upheaval in India.
● The viceroy refused to accept
preconditions set by the Congress.
(Constituent Assembly for establishment
of Responsible Government at the
Centre). But, the British Government
desperately wanted the active
cooperation of Indians in the war effort.
To secure this cooperation, it sent to
India in March, 1942, a mission headed
by a Cabinet Minister Sir Stafford Cripps
and before that the August Offer.
August Offer (1940)
The Viceroy Linlithgow put forward a
proposal that included-
● Dominion status in the unspecified
future.
● A post war body to enact Constitution.
● Expansion of Governor-General’s
council with representation of the
minorities.
● Establishment of a War Advisory Council.
● Congress rejected this offer as there was
no suggestion for a National Government.
Muslim League accepted it.
Individual Satyagraha
● Congress rejected the August offer
because Congress was convinced that
the British would not modify their policy
in India. Gandhi decided to start the
Individual Satyagraha in September
1940.
● Vinoba Bhave was the first to offer
individual Satyagraha, followed by
Jawaharlal Nehru and Brahma Dutt.
● Delhi Chalo Movement began.
Cripps Mission, 1942
● A mission under Sir Stafford Cripps was
sent to India in march 1942. He proposed
a Dominion status. The British
Government’s refusal of accepting
immediately the Congress demand of
forming a National Government was the
cause of failure of the mission.
Constitutional Proposal of
the Cripps Mission
(a) Dominion status to be granted after
the war.
(b) Constitution making body to be
elected from provincial assemblies
and nominated by the rulers in case of
princely states.
(c) Individual princes could sign a
separate agreement with the British.
(d) British would however, control the
defence for war period.
The British Government undertook to
accept and implement the Constitution
on two conditions:
● Any province(s) unwilling to accept the
Constitution could form a separate
union with separate Constitution.
98
● The new Constitution making body and
the British Government would negotiate
a treaty to sort out matters arising out of
transfer of power to Indian hands.
● Gandhi termed this proposal as a post
dated cheque in a crashing bank.
● Though, Cripps proposal failed but it
provided legitimacy to the demand for
Pakistan by accomodating it in the
provision for provincial autonomy.
Quit India Movement, 1942
● The All India Congress Committee met
at Bombay on 8th August, 1942. It
passed the famous Quit India resolution
and proposed to start off a non-violent
mass struggle under Gandhi’s
leadership.
● It is also called Wardha proposal and
leaderless revolt.
● Gandhi told the British to quit and leave
India in God’s hand. His message was Do
or Die.
● Repressive policy of the government and
indiscriminate arrest of the leaders
provoked people to violence.
● Nehru was lodged in Almora jail,
Maulana Azad in Bankura and Gandhi
was kept in Agha Khan’s palace, Poona.
In many areas, government lost control
and the people established Swaraj.
Parallel governments were established.
● In Satara, Pratisarkar was set up under
Nana Patil and in Baliya under Chittu
Pande. Others were in Talcher and
Bihar. In Bengal, Tamluk Jatiya Sarkar
functioned in Midnapore.
● Underground revolutionary activity also
started by Jaiprakash Narain and
Ramanandan Mishra escaped from
Hazaribagh Jail and organised an
underground movement.
● In Bombay, the socialist leaders
continued their underground activities
under leaders like Aruna Asaf Ali.
Congress radio was established with
Usha Mehta as its announcer and
Rammanohar Lohia in Bihar.
● School and college students and women
actively participated, workers went on
strikes. There were no communal
clashes during the movement.
● The merchant community and capilatist
did not participate. Muslim League kept
aloof and the Hindu Mahasabha
condemned the movement. Communist
party did not support the movement.
Rajagopalachari also did not participate.
Demand for Pakistan
● In 1930, Md Iqbal for the first time
suggested that the Frontier Province,
Sind, Baluchistan and Kashmir be made
the Muslim state within the federation.
● Chaudhary Rehmat Ali coined the term

● The fear of Muslims to be subjugated by
Hindus in free India was realised by
Jinnah and he demanded for the
creation of Pakistan.
● Pakistan Resolution Muslim League
first passed the proposal of Separate
Pakistan in its Lahore Session in 1940
(called Jinnah’s Two-Nation theory). It
was drafted by Sikandar Hayat Khan,
moved by Fazlul Haq and seconded by
Khaliquzzaman. It rejected the federal
scheme envisaged in the Government of
India Act, 1935.In December 1943, the
Karachi Session of the Muslim League
adopted the slogan–‘Divide and Quit’.
Gandhiji’s Fast
(10th February– 7th March, 1943)
Gandhiji undertook a 21 day fast for
condemning the violence of the people during
the Quit India Movement.
Rajagopalachari
Formula (1944)
● Also known as Rajaji formula (1944),
Rajagopalachari proposed that a
commission could be appointed for
demarcating district in the North-West
and East, where Muslims were in
absolute majority. Plebiscite would be
held on the basis of adult suffrage, that
would ultimately decide the issue of
separation from Hindustan.
● If majority decides in favour of forming a
separate sovereign state then such could
be accepted.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 99
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● Jinnah objected this as he wanted
Congress to accept two-nation theory and
wanted only Muslims of the North-West
and East to vote in the plebiscite.

was first conceived in Malaya by Mohan
Singh, an Indian officer of the British
Indian Army.
● The Japanese handed over the Indian
prisoners of war to Mohan Singh, who tried
to recruit them into an Indian National
Army. By the end of 1942, 40000 men were
ready to join the INA. The outbreak of the
Quit India Movement gave a fillip to the INA.

India and they rejected the demand for
a full-fledged Pakistan.
● The Congress demanded that power
should be transferred to one centre
and that minorities would demands be
worked out only after the British left
the country. Congress and league
differed on the issue of the nature of
grouping. Congress wanted the
grouping to be optional till the
formation of Constituent Assembly,
but Jinnah was in the favour of
compulsory grouping.
Jinnah’s Direct Action

of the Constituent Assembly (Congress
won 209 of the total 273 seats) and

MUSIC
The music of India is said to be one of the
oldest unbroken musical traditions in the
World.
Many different legends have grown up
concerning the origin and development of
Indian classical music.
Hindustani Music
Classical Music
● Hindustani classical music originated in
North India around the 13th and 14th
centuries. In contrast to Carnatic music,
the Hindustani classical music was not
only influenced by ancient Hindu
musical traditions and Vedic philosophy,
but also by the Persian elements.
● Hindustani music is based on the Raga
system. The Raga is a melodic scale,
comprising of notes from the basic seven
- Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni.
● On the basis of notes included in it, each
raga attains a different character. The
form of the raga is also determined by
112 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
the particular pattern of ascent and
descent of the notes, which may not be
strictly linear.
● Hindustani classical music is primarily
vocal-centric. The major vocal forms
associated with Hindustani classical
music are the khayal, ghazal, dhrupad,
Tappa, tarana and thumri.
Khayal
It is a form of vocal music adopted from
medieval Persian music. It is based on
imagination and improvisations of the
performer.
Dhrupad
It is the oldest form of Hindustani music,
traditionally performed by male singers. It is
mostly a poetic form. Tansen Sang in
dhrupad style.
Tappa
It is developed in 18th century from the folk
songs of camel riders of Punjab. They are
essentially folklore of love and passion and
written in Punjabi. Developed as a form of
classical music by Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori.
Tarana
It is a medium to fast paced song usually
performed towards the end of the concert. It
consists of a few lines of poetry with
rhythmic syllables.
Thumri
It is an informal vocal form of Hindustani
classical music and is said to have begun
with the court of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the
Nawab of Oudh.
Ghazal
It is a poetic form consisting of rhyming
couplets on love and devotion.
It is an ancient form originating in 6th
century Arabic poetry. It spread into South
Asia in the 12th century, due to the influence
of Sufi mystics.
Gharana
There is a rich tradition of Gharanas in
classical Hindustani music. These schools
or Gharanas have their basis in the
traditional mode of musical training and
education. Every Gharana has its own
distinct features.
Gwalior Gharana
This is the oldest among all the Khayal
Gayaki (vocal) styles. Its distinctive
feature is its lucidity and simplicity. It is
founded by Hassu Khan and Nathu Khan.
Agra Gharana
The Agra Gharana places great
importance on developing forcefulness
and deepness in the voice, so that the
notes are powerful and resonant founded
by Haji Sujan Khan.
Kirana Gharana
It derives its name from the birth-place of
Abdul Kharim Khan of Kirana near
Kurukshetra. In the Kirana style of
singing, the swara is used to create an
emotional mood by means of elongation
and use of Kana-s.
Rampur Sahaswan Gharana
In Rampur Sahaswan Gharana, there is a
stress on the clarity of swara and the
development and elaboration of the raga
is done through a stepwise progression.
Founded by Inayat Khan.
Patiala Gharana
Founded by Inayat Khan. Regarded as an
off-shoot of the Delhi Gharana, the
Patiala Gharana is characterised by the
use of greater rhythm play and by
Layakari with the abundant use of Bols,
particularly Bol tans founded by ustad
Fateh Ali Khan.
Delhi Gharana
The Delhi Gharana was represented by
Tanras Khan and Shabbu Khan. The
highlights of Delhi Gharana are pleasing
vistaar and exquisite compositions.
Founded by Ustad Mamman Khan.
Banaras Gharana
The Banaras Gharana evolved as a result
of great tilting style of khayal singing
known by Thumri singers of Banaras and
Gaya. Founded by Pt. Gopal Mishra.
Mewati Gharana
The Mewati Gharana gives importance to
developing the mood of the raga through
the notes forming it and its style is Bhava
Pradhan. It also gives equal importance
to the meaning of the text.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
ARCHITECTURE
Indian architecture, which has evolved
through centuries, is the result of
socio-economic and geographical
conditions of the region. Indian
architecture evolved in various stages in
different parts and regions of the country.
Apart from the natural evolution Indian
architecture was generally affected by
many great and important historic
developments.
Rajput Architecture
● The Rajputs were great patrons of art and
architecture, the finest examples being
their forts and palaces. The Rajput
palaces are complex compositions built
as inner citadels surrounded by the city
and enclosed by a fortified wall as at
Chittorgarh and Jaisalmer. Some forts,
such as those at Bharatpur and Deeg,
were protected by wide moats.
● The palaces of Jaisalmer, Bikaner,
Jodhpur, Udaipur and Kota represent the
maturity of the Rajput style.
Deccan Style
● The architecture of the Deccan is
marked by its distinct originality and
independence of style, unlike the
architectural styles of the other
provinces, which combined both the
temple architecture and the Islamic
building ideals. It derived its elements
from the architectural styles of the
Sultan of Delhi and that of the distant
Persia.
● Some key features of this style are the
presence of bulbous domes with lotus
neck, military style of architecture,
presence of thick walls and combination
of gateway and mosque-like Charminar.
Mughal Style
● The medieval period saw great
developments in the field of architecture.
With the coming of Muslims to India,
many new features came to be
introduced in buildings. The
development of Muslim style of
architecture of this period can be called
the Indo-Islamic architecture or the
Indian architecture influenced by
Islamic Art.
● The Indo-Islamic style was neither
strictly Islamic nor strictly Hindu.
● The earliest building of this period is
Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque and the
Qutub Minar at Delhi.
PUPPETRY
● The early puppet shows in India dealt
mostly with histories of great kings.
Princes and heroes and also political
satire in rural areas.
● There are four types of puppetry in
India—String puppets, Shadow puppets,
Rod puppets and Glove puppets.
PAINTING
The history of Indian paintings is just about
as old as the history of the people of India.
The most primitive instances of paintings
in India can be traced back to cave
paintings of Bhimbetka.
Mughal School
● This school has a specific style of South
Asian painting. Usually, it was confined
to miniatures either as book depictions
or as individual works to be kept in
albums.
● This practice materialised from Persian
miniature painting, with Indian
influences of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain.
● It wonderfully blossomed during the
Mughal Empire. Later, this school of
painting reached other Indian courts of
Muslims and Hindus and afterwards
Sikhs.
● Akbar and Jahangir were exceptionally
great patrons of this painting. Mughal
School of painting revolved around court
scenes, portraits, hunting scenes, lovers,
battle fronts etc.
Rajput School
● This school progressed and thrived
during the 18th century in the majestic
Rajputana courts.
● This school of painting flooded from the
approach of Mughal painting.
● A typical style of painting with particular
common characteristics came up in
every Rajput realm.
117
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● This school illustrated an assortment of themes like landscapes, events from the
Mahabharata, Ramayana, Krishna’s life and about human beings.
Bengal School
● This school was a fashion of art, which progressed during the British Raj of India in
early 20th century.
● Indian Nationalism was greatly linked to this painting. British art administrators also
supported and promoted it.
● Raja Ravi Verma and Abanindranath Tagore were amongst the pioneer artists of this
school. Today’s renowned artists, who belong to this School include Nilima Dutta,
Sudip Roy, Paresh Maiti and Bikash Bhattacharjee.

GEOGRAPHY
● Geography is the science that studies
the lands, the features, the inhabitants
and the phenomena on the Earth.
● The discipline of geography was
invented in the 2nd century BC by the
Greek Scholar Eratosthenes.
Branches of Geography
Geography is divided into two main
branches i.e. physical geography and
human geography.
Some Contributors
to Geography
■ Eratosthenes was the first person to
calculate the circumference of the Earth
and also calculate the tilt of the Earth’s
axis.
■ Anaximander created the first map of
world.
■ Varahamihira’s Brihatsamhita gave a
thorough description of planetary
movements, rainfall, clouds etc.
■ Ptolemy first presented India on the
world map.
■ The History of Mankind was written by
Friedrich Ratzel.
Human Geography
Human geography is a branch of the
geography that studies the world, its
people, communities and cultures, with
an emphasis on relations of land across
space and place.
The fields of human geography are as follow:
● Cultural geography
● Development geography
● Economic geography
● Transport geography
● Historical geography
● Political geography
● Population geography
● Settlement geography
Physical Geography
Physical geography deals with the physical
environment and the various process that
bring about changes in the physical
environment on the Earth surface.
The fields of physical geography are as follow:
● Geomorphology It is the scientific study of
landforms and processes that shape them.
● Hydrology It is the study of the
movement, distribution and quality of
water on Earth, including the hydrological
cycle, water resources and environmental
watershed sustainability.
● Climatology It is the study of climate,
which is scientifically defined as weather
conditions averaged over a period of time.
● Pedology It is the study of soils in their
natural environment.
● Glaciology It is the study of glaciers and
ice sheets.
● Biogeography It is the study of
relationships of organisms with their
environment.
WORLD GEOGRAPHY
Universe
● The universe is commonly defined as the
totality of everything that exists
including all physical matter and energy,
the planets, stars, galaxies and the
contents of intergalactic space.
● The study of universe is known as
Cosmology.
● The universe comprises of billions of
galaxies. The galaxies are made up of
millions of stars held together by the
force of gravity and these stars account
for most of the masses of the galaxy.
● Our own galaxy is called the Milky Way
(or the Akash Ganga) and it contains
about 300 billion stars and one of these is
the Sun. Planets and other objects
revolve around the Sun and make up the
solar system with the Sun at the
centre.Andromeda is our nearest galaxy.
● In AD 140, Ptolemy propounded the
theory that the Earth was the centre of
the universe and the Sun and the other
heavenly bodies revolved around it.
● In 1543, Copernicus said that the Sun
and not the Earth is the centre of
universe.
● Kepler supported Copernicus but said
that the Sun is the centre of solar system
and not the universe.
● In 1924, Edwin Hubble first
demonstrated existence of galaxies
beyond Milky Way.
● Structurally, the galaxies are found in
three forms
(i) Spiral galaxies have a central
nucleus with great spiral arms. Milky
Way and Andromeda are the
examples.
(ii) Elliptical galaxies are without spiral
arms and have ellipsoid shape.
(iii) Irregular galaxies have no shape.
Evolution of Universe
The three main theories put forward to
explain the origin and evolution of the
universe are
(i) Big Bang Theory (Proposed by
Georges Lemaitre) Big Bang was an
explosion that occurred 13.8 billion
years ago, leading to the formation of
galaxies of stars and other heavenly
bodies.
(ii) Steady State Theory Bondi, Gold and
Fred Hoyle developed this theory. It
states that although the universe is
expanding, it nevertheless does not
change its appearance over time and
it has no beginning and no end.
(iii) The Pulsating Theory According to
this theory, the universe is supposed
to be expanding and contracting
alternately i.e. pulsating. At present,
the universe is expanding.
NASA has launched the Cosmic
Background Explorer (COBE) and the
Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe
(WMAP) missions to study the radiation
present in the universe.
Stars
● Stars are heavenly bodies made up of hot
burning gases. They produce their own
light.
● A neutron star is about 20 km in
diameter and has a mass of about 1.4
times that of the Sun. Neutron stars are
formed by supernova explosions. A
pulsar is a highly magnetised and
rotating neutron star.
● A star’s colour indicates the temperature
of its surface. Blue colour denotes
maximum temperature. White, yellow,
orange, red stars have sequentially
declining range of temperatures.
Evolutionary Stages of a Star
1. Proto Star It is the stage, where the
helium core become increasingly
heavy, accompanied with expanding
outer layers.
2. Red Giant This stage results into
the swelling and reddening of the
outer regions of the star. Such stars of
gigantic dimension is called Red Star.
3. White Dwarf If the mass of the star
is relatively small like that of our Sun,
the gases that reach the outer layer
are expelled. As these expelled gases
cool and contract, the star becomes a
White Dwarf.
Stars: Quick Digest
■ Brightest star outside solar system is Sirius,
also called as Dog Star.
■ Closest star to our solar system is Proxima
Centauri (4.2 light years away) followed by
Alpha Centauri (4.3 light years away) and
Barnard’s Star (5.9 light years away).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 125
Concept of Black Hole and
Chandrashekhar Limit
● A renowned Indian Physicist Chandrashekhar had predicted an upper limit to the
mass of stars, which is called as
Chandrashekhar limit. It is 1.44 times the
mass of the Sun.
● Above the upper limit, two conditions are
possible.
1. Explosion of the star to form neutron
star.
2. Collapse and compaction of the stars to
form Black Hole.
● The black holes are formed due to collapse
and compaction under gravity, at the end of
the life cycle of a star.
● Some of the units used for the calculation of
distances in universe are as follows:
Units of Distance
Unit Description of the Unit
Light year It is the distance that light can
travel in 1 year. It is equal to almost
9 46 1012
. × km.
Astronomical
unit
It is the average distance
between the Sun and the Earth.
1AU = 150 million km
Parsec It is the distance from the Earth to
a star that has parallax of 1 arc
second. The actual length is
about 3.262 light years.
SOLAR SYSTEM
● The solar system comprises the Sun, 8
planets, their satellites and other
non-stellar objects, which are believed to
have been developed from the
condensation of gases and other lesser
bodies.
● The Sun is at the centre of the solar system
and all the planets revolve around it in an
elliptical orbit. It is the nearest star to the
Earth.
● The end of Solar System is about 122
AU (Astronomical units) away from
the Sun.
Components of the
Solar System
Our Solar System consists of
● The Sun, Eight planets (excluding
Pluto) and their respective satellites.
● Interstellar debris such as asteroids,
meteoroids, comets.
● The electrically charged gases, called
Plasma.
● Interplanetary dust particles.
● the components of solar system other
than planets, dwarf planets and
satellites are called as Small Solar
System Bodies (SSSB).

THE SUN
● The Sun accounts for more than
99 per cent of the mass of the Solar
System and due to this, the Sun
exerts immense gravitational pull on
the planets to keep them rotating
around it in definite elliptical orbit.
● The Sun is the major source of energy
in the solar system. The energy is
provided by the nuclear fusion
reaction, that converts hydrogen into
helium in the core of the Sun.

SUN
● The glowing surface of the Sun that we see
is called Photosphere. Above the
photosphere is the red coloured
Chromosphere and beyond it is the
magnificent corona, which is most easily
visible during eclipses.
¡ Hydrogen and helium are the main gases
present in the Sun.
¡ The sun has a surface temperature of
about 6000°C.
¡ It takes 224 million years to complete one
circle (revolution) around the centre of
the Milky Way. This is known as a Cosmic
year.
¡ The Sun is 1300000 times bigger than the
Earth in terms of volume.
● Superimposed on Sun’s white light are
hundred of dark lines called Fraunhofer
lines. Each line indicates some elements
existing as gases in the Solar System.

Concepts Associated with the Sun
● Solar Winds The Sun is continuously
emitting streams of photons in all
directions either as spiral streams called
Solar Wind or bouts of incandescent
material called Solar Flares. Solar flares
increases ionisation in upper atmosphere
and thus pose danger to satellite
communication.
● Aurora The constituent particles of
the solar wind are trapped by the
Earth’s magnetic field and enter the
Earth’s upper atmosphere as Aurora. It
is described as Aurora Borealis in the
Northern hemisphere and Aurora
Australis in Southern hemisphere.
● Plages and Sunspots The
chromosphere of the Sun is
continuously changing. Bright spots on
the chromosphere are called Plages
and dark spots are called Sunspots.
The Sunspots are cold and dark regions
on the Sun’s surface with a periodicity
of 11 years. These spots greatly
influence the global climate.
PLANETS
● Planets are celestial bodies, which
continuously revolve around and are
lighted by a star. There are eight
planets in the solar system that revolve
around the Sun in an elliptical orbit.
● The sequence of planets according to
their size (in descending order) is
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
Earth, Venus, Mars and Mercury.
● The sequence of planets according to
their distance from the Sun is Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune.

¡ it is in orbit around the Sun.
¡ it has sufficient mass so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape.
¡ it has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.
● A non-satellite body fulfilling the first two rule is classified as a Dwarf planet. So, Pluto

THE EARTH’S
MOVEMENT
● The Earth moves in space in two distinct
ways:Rotation and Revolution.
(i) It rotates on its own axis from West
to East once in every 24 hours. It
causes day and night.
(ii) It revolves around the Sun in an
orbit once in every 365¼ days. It
causes the seasons and the year.
Rotation of Earth
● Spins on its imaginary axis from West to
East in 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09
seconds.
● The rotational speed at equator is
maximum (1667 km/hr) and then
decreases towards the poles, where it is
zero.
● The days and the nights are equal at the
equator.
The rotation of the Earth has the following
implications such as:
■ Causation of day and night.
■ Change in the direction of winds and
ocean currents.
■ Rise and fall of tides everyday.
■ A difference of one hour between the
two meridians which are 15° apart.
Revolution of Earth
● It is the Earth’s motion in elliptical orbit
around the Sun. It takes 365 days, 5
hours, 48 minutes and 45.51 seconds. It
leads to one extra day in every fourth year.
The revolution of the Earth results in
■ changes of season.
■ variation of the length of the days and
nights at different times of the year.
132 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Shifting of the wind belts.
The figure given below shows the revolution of the Earth and its effects on seasons
and the variations of lengths of day and night.
Major Difference Between Rotation and Revolution of Earth
Rotation Revolution
Spinning of Earth on its own axis. Movement of the Earth around the Sun in an elliptical
orbit.
Earth takes 24 hours to complete one
rotation.
The Earth takes 365.25 days to complete one revolution.
Rotation causes day and night. Revolution along with inclination of the Earth on its axis
causes change in seasons.
Earth’s Position wrt Moon
Apogee Perigee
The period of the farthest distance between the
Moon and the Earth is called Apogee. It is about
406000 km.
The period of the nearest distance between the
Moon and the Earth is called Perigee. It is about
356400 km.
Earth’s Position wrt Sun
Perihelion Aphelion
The period of the nearest distance
between the Earth and the Sun is
Perihelion. It happens on 3rd
January and the distance is 147
million km.
The period of the farthest distance between the Earth and the
Sun is Aphelion. It happens on 4th July and the distance is
152 million km.
Tilt of the Earth’s Axis
● The axis of the Earth is inclined to the plane of ecliptic (the plane, in which the Earth
orbits round the Sun) at an angle of 66½°, giving rise to different seasons and varying
lengths of day and night.

Revolution of the Earth
● If the axis were perpendicular to
this plane, all parts of the globe
would have equal days and
nights at all times of the year.
● The Earth is tilted about 23.5°
from a line perpendicular to
ecliptic plane.
Equinoxes
● These are the days, when days
and nights are equal. Under this
situation, the Sun is vertically
overhead at the equator. It
happens on two days of the year
i.e. 21st March and 23rd
September.
● 21st March: Vernal Equinox.
● 23rd September: Autumnal
Equinox.
Summer Solstice
● After the March equinox, the
Sun appears to move Northward
and is vertically overhead at the
Tropic of Cancer on 21st June.
This is known as Summer
Solstice.
● On 21st June, the Northern
hemisphere will have its longest
day and shortest night. The
Southern hemisphere will have
shortest day and longest night.
Winter Solstice
● On 22nd December, the Sun is
overhead at the Tropic of
Capricorn. This is the winter
solstice, when the Southern
hemisphere will have its longest
day and shortest night.
A summary of daylight hours in
the Northern and Southern
hemisphere is as follows:

divided as a result of the climatic conditions,
mainly due to the changes in duration and
intensity of solar radiation.
● There are four seasons:

Latitude
● Latitude is the angular distance of a point on the
Earth’s surface from the centre of the Earth,
measured in degree. These lines are called
parallels of latitude and on the globe they are
represented as circles. The circumference of the
circles decreases from equator to pole and at the
pole it converges to a point.
● The distance between any two parallels of
latitude is always equal. One degree latitude =
111 km (approx). The most important lines of
latitudes are Equator (0°), the Tropic of Cancer
(23½°N), the Tropic of Capricorn (23½°S), the
Arctic Circle (66½°N) and the Antarctic Circle
(66½°S).
Longitude
● Longitude is the angular distance of a point on
the Earth’s surface along the equator, East or
West from the Prime meridian. On the globe,
they form semi-circles from pole to pole passing
through the equator.

Perpendicular
● Prime meridian is the semi-circle from pole to
pole, from which all the other meridians
radiate Eastwards and Westwards up to 180°.
In 1884, it has been decided that the zero
degree meridian is the one that passes through
the Royal Astronomical Observatory at
Greenwich near London. 180° meridian
(International Date Line) is exactly opposite to
the prime meridian. Such points are called
antipodal points.
Universal Time (Standard time)
and Time Zones
● To avoid confusion about having many local
times within one country, a particular
meridian is chosen for the whole country,
whose time is known as standard time.
● The Indian Government has accepted the
meridian of 82.5 degree East for standard
time, which is 5 hrs 30 mins ahead
of the Greenwich Mean Time.
● The Earth is divided in 24
longitudinal zones, each being 15
degree or 1 hour apart in time (360
degree = 24 hours, 360/24 =15
degree in 1 hour) or 1 degree in 4
minute are called Standard Time
Zones.
● Larger countries such as USA,
Russia and Canada, which have
greater East-West stretch have to
adopt several time zones for
practical purposes.
● Russia has as many as 11 time zones.
● Both USA and Canada have five
time zones, viz, the Atlantic,
Eastern, Central, Mountain and
Pacific time zones.
● A simple memory aid for time is
East-Gain-Add (EGA) and WestLose-Subtract (WLS).
International Date Line
● It is the 180 degree meridian
running over the Pacific Ocean,
deviating at Aleutian Island, Fiji,
Samoa and Gilbert Island.
● At the International Date Line, the
date changes by exactly one day,
when it is crossed.
● Samoa and Tokelau shifted its
position to the West of the date line
on 30th December, 2011.
ECLIPSE
● An eclipse occurs when the Sun, the Moon and the Earth are in a straight line. There
are two types of eclipses-Solar and Lunar eclipse.
● Generally, a total of seven eclipse including solar and lunar eclipses, take place in a
year.

EARTH’S INTERIOR
The interior of Earth is divided into
three parts
(i) Crust (ii) Mantle (iii) Core
The Crust
● The crust is the outermost and the
thinnest layer of the Earth. This
layer has the least density and its
thickness varies about 8 to 40 km.
Mohorovicic Discontinuity or
Moho, marks the lower limit of the
crust. This discontinuity is
identified on the basis of rock
density.
● Thickness of the crust is more in
the continents and lesser in the
oceans while density of continental
crust is lower than oceanic crust.
● The rocks forming the upper layer
of crust of the Earth are rich in
lighter minerals like silica and
aluminium. Hence, this layer is
also called as SiAl (silica and
aluminium). The average density of
this layer is 2.7 gm/cm3
.
● Due to presence of minerals like
silica and magnesium in the lower
part of Earth’s crust, it is also
known as SiMa (silica and
magnesium).
● Sial and Sima together form Earth’s
crust.
The Mantle
● This layer is the intermediate layer
of the Earth in terms of both its
location and density.
● It is about 2900 km in thickness,
composed of minerals in a semisolid state.
● It is divided into further two layer
upper mantle and lower mantle.
The upper part of the mantle is
called the Asthenosphere, which is
about 250 km thick.
● The average density of this layer is about 5.68
gm/cm3
.
● The transitional zone separating the mantle
from the core is called the Gutenberg
Discontinuity.
The Core
● The core is the innermost layer of the Earth
and occupies its centre. It is about 3500 km in
radius.
● The core is further divided into two layers :
outer core and inner core.
● The outer part of the core is believed to have
the properties of a liquid and the innermost
part of the core (about 1255 km in radius)
may be called solid or crystalline.
● This layer is also known as NiFe (nickel and
iron), because this layer contain large
concentration of iron and nickel.
● Temperature of the core is between 2200°C
and 2750° C.
● Density of this part of the Earth is
13.6 gm/cm3
and is many times greater than
the average density of the Earth
(5.53 gm/cm3
).

Continental Drift Theory
● This theory is given by Alfred
Wegener, in 1915, to explain the
origin and evolution of the continents
and the oceans. According to this
theory, about 250 million years ago,
there was only one huge continental
landmass named Pangea and it was
surrounded by one huge mass of water
body, named Panthalassa.
● The present shape of the continents
and oceans is due to the break up of
Pangaea.
● This breaking process started about
200 million years ago.
● The Northern rift cuts Pangea from
East to West creating Laurasia in the
North and Gondwanaland in South. A
shallow sea called Tethys was situated
between the Laurasia and the
Gondwanaland.
Sea Floor Spreading Theory
● The concept of sea floor spreading was first
formulated by Harry Hess in the year
1960.
● According to this theory, the mid oceanic
ridges were situated on the rising thermal
convective current coming from mantle.
● The oceanic crust moves in opposite
directions from mid oceanic ridges and
thus there is continuous upwelling of new
molten materials along the mid oceanic
ridges. These molten masses cool down
and solidify to form new crust.
Plate Tectonics Theory
● Plate tectonic theory is a scientific theory
that describe the large-scale motions of
Earth’s lithosphere.
● The word tectonics comes from the Greek
word meaning builder.
● The theory of Plate tectonics states that
the lithosphere is divided into several rigid
segments, which include both oceanic and
continental crusts. These segments are
called plates and they are moving on the
asthenosphere, which is not a liquid, but a
semi-solid which flows under stress.
● About 20 such plates have been identified.
There are seven major plates such as
Eurasia, Antarctica, North America, South
America, Pacific, African and Indian Plate.
● There are various intermediate sized plates
such as China, Philippine, Arabian, Iran,
Nazca, Cocos, Caribbean and Scotia
Plates.
Plate Margins
Depending upon the type of movement, plate
margins are of three types :
(i) Divergent Plate Margin (Constructive
margins)
(ii) Convergent Plate Margin (Destructive
margins)
(iii) Parallel Plate Margin (Conservative
margin or Transform Boundary)
● Collision can occur between two oceanic
plates, one oceanic and one continental
plate or two continental plates.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 137
FORCES AND PROCESSES AFFECTING THE
EARTH’S CRUST
● Appearance of the surface of the Earth keeps changing.
● These changes are produced under the influence of two type of forces.
These are given below :
EXOGENETIC OR EXTERNAL FORCES
● The forces occurring on the surface of the Earth are called the external or exogenetic
forces.
● Weathering and Erosion are the examples of external forces.
Weathering
It is the process of disintegration or decomposition of rocks in situ by natural agents.
There are three types of weathering
1. Physical Weathering
(or mechanical weathering)
● It involves rock disintegration
without any change in the
chemical constituents of the
rocks.
● The factors responsible for
physical weathering are
temperature change,
crystallisation of water into
ice, the pressure release
mechanism.
2. Chemical Weathering It
involves the decomposition due
to chemical changes. There are
various chemical processes,
which cause chemical weathering such as Solution, Oxidation, Carbonation,
Hydration, Hydrolysis and Chelation.
3. Biological Weathering It is mainly controlled by plants and animals and human
beings. It is divided into three types
(i) Faunal weathering (ii) Floral weathering (iii)Anthropogenic weathering
Erosion
● It involves removal of rock material and their transportation. Erosion is performed by
mobile agents such as rivers, streams, winds, waves and underground water.
138 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Types of Plate Boundary
Divergent Plate Boundary Convergent Plate Boundary Transform Fault Boundary
When the plates move apart
with the upwelling of material
from the mantle, divergent
plate boundary are formed.
A convergent plate boundary is
one, where two plates collide, one
plate bending downward and
subducting below the other.
They are located, where
plates slide past one another
without the creation or
destruction of crust.
Formation of the mid-oceanic
ridges are the example of
divergent plate margin.
Deep oceanic trench is formed
adjacent to the zone of subduction.
Fold mountains are the result of
convergent plate boundary.
San Andreas fault along the
West coast of Mexico is a
famous transform fault.
The Process of Chemical Weathering
Process Mechanism of Chemical Weathering
Solution It involves the dissolution of soluble
particles and minerals from the rocks
with the help of water.
Oxidation It represents addition of oxygen to form
oxides.
Carbonation It is the reaction of carbonate or
bicarbonate ions with minerals.
Hydration It is the process of addition of water to
the minerals.
Hydrolysis It is the process wherein both minerals
of rocks and water moleclues
decompose and react in such a way that
new mineral compounds are formed.
ENDOGENETIC OR
INTERNAL FORCES
● The forces originating in the
interior of the Earth are called the
internal or the endogenetic forces.
● These forces are of two types
Sudden Endogenetic
Forces or Catastrophic
Forces
● Sudden endogenetic forces are the
result of long periods of
preparation deep within the Earth.
● But their cumulative effects on
the Earth’s surface are quick and
sudden.
● Volcanoes, and Earthquakes are
the examples of sudden
endogenetic forces.
Slow and Gradual
Endogenetic Forces or
Diastrophic Forces
● Diastrophic forces include both
vertical and horizontal movements
which are caused due to forces
deep within the Earth. These
diastrophic forces operate very
slowly and there effects become
visible after thousands and millions
of years.
● These forces termed as
constructive forces affects larger
areas of the globe and produce
meso-level reliefs e.g. mountains,
plateaus, plains, tectonic lakes,
big faults etc.
● These diastrophic forces are
further subdivided into two groups
namely epirogenetic forces and
orogenetic forces.
Epirogenetic Force
¡ These are vertical movements.
¡ It causes upliftment and
subsidence of continental masses
through upward movements.
These forces and resultant
movements affect larger parts of
the continents. These are further
divided into two type: upward
movement and downward
movement.
Orogenetic Force
● Orogenetic movement is caused due to
endogenetic forces working in horizontal
movement. Horizontal forces and movements
are also called as tangential forces.
Orogenetic or horizontal forces work in two
ways, namely
(i) in opposite direction from each other and
(ii) towards each other.
● When it operates in opposite direction it is
called tensional force. Tensional force create,
faulting cracking and fracture. Tensional
forces are also called as divergent forces.
● The force, when operates face to face, is called
compressional force or convergent force.
Compressional forces create folding and
warping.
EARTHQUAKES
● It refers to the vibration on the Earth’s surface
caused by the catastrophic endogenetic forces.
● The magnitude or intensity of energy released
by an earthquake is measured by the Richter
Scale, whereas the damage caused is measured
by modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.
● The place of origin of earthquake is called
focus. The place on the ground surface, which
is perpendicular to the focus or hypocentre is
called Epicentre.
● Seismology is the special branch of geology
that deals with the study of earthquake.

EARTHQUAKE WAVES
Earthquake waves are seismic waves that
are created when energy builds up in rocks
and they fracture.
Earthquake waves are basically of two
types : body waves and surface waves.
Body Waves
They are generated due to the release of
energy at the focus and move in all
directions travelling through the body of
the Earth. The body waves interact with
the surface rocks and generate new set of
waves called Surface Wave. There are two
types of body waves, Primary and
Secondary waves.
1. Primary Waves
Primary Waves (P Waves) These are the
waves of short wavelength and high
frequency. They are longitudinal waves
and can travel through solid, liquid and
gases.
2. Secondary Waves
Secondary Waves (S Waves) These are the
waves of short wavelength and high
frequency. They are transverse waves,
which travel through only solid particles.
Surface Waves or Long
Waves (L Waves)
They are the waves of long wavelength, and
they travel through the Earth’s crust. It
causes most of the structural damage on
the surface of Earth during an earthquake.
THE EARTHQUAKE
ZONES IN INDIA
The Indian plate is moving from South to
North at the speed of 5 cm/year and the
Eurasian Plate is static at its own fixed
position, so there is a collision between
Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. Due to
this collision, the earthquakes occurs in
the Himalayan region of India. The
collision also results in the increase of the
height of Himalayas at the speed of 1
cm/year.
● An important earthquake zone is located
parallel to Punjab and Rann of Kachchh.
It occurs due to the movement between
the transform boundaries of Eurasian
and Indian Plates.
● Earthquakes occur in Assam,
Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Tripura,
Manipur, Mizoram, Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Jammu and Kashmir,
the North-Western region of Uttar
Pradesh and the Northern region of
Bihar etc.
Distribution of Earthquakes
Most of the world’s earthquakes occur in
● the zones of young fold mountain
● the zones of folding and faulting
● the zone of junction of continental and
oceanic margin
● the zone of active volcanoes
● along different plate boundaries
The traditional zones of earthquakes are
¡ Circum Pacific belt
¡ Mid Continental belt
¡ Mid Atlantic belt
SHADOW ZONE
● There are some specific area where
earthquake waves do not occur or occur
rarely. Such areas are termed as Shadow
zones.
● It is located between 105° and 140° from
epicentre.
VOLCANISM
● Volcanism includes all phenomena
connected with the movement of heated
material from the interior towards the
surface of the Earth.

Earthquake Waves
● A volcano is a vent or opening, through which heated molten materials consisting of
gases, water, liquid lava, fragments of rocks are ejected from the highly heated and
melted interior to the surface of the Earth.
Volcanic eruptions are closely associated with several integrated processes such as:
● Gradual increase in temperature with increasing depth, due to the heat generated by
degeneration of radioactive elements inside the Earth.
● Origin of magma due to the lowering of the melting point caused by reduction in
pressure of overlying rocks which is due to fractures caused by splitting of plates.
● Origin of gases and water vapour due to heating of water.
● Ascent of magma due to pressure from gases and vapour.
● Occurrence of volcanic eruption.
Classification of Volcanoes
On the Basis of Mode of Eruption
Central Eruption or Explosive Type Fissure Eruption or Quiet Eruption
Here the magma comes with great force
through the small vent and forms volcanic
cones. e.g. Hawaiian type, Strombolian type,
Pelean type, Vesuvious type, etc.
Large quantities of lava quietly flow up from
fissures and spread out over the surrounding
areas. Successive flow of lava results in the growth
of lava plateau. e.g. Deccan Plateau.
On the Basis of Periodicity of Eruptions
Active Volcanoes Dormant Volcanoes Extinct Volcanoes
Those volcanoes that
frequently erupt or they
have erupted in recent
times. e.g. Mt. Etna in
Italy.
Those volcanoes that have been
known to erupt and show signs
of possible eruptions in future.
e.g., Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa
Volcanoes that have not erupted at
all in historic times but they retain the
features of a volcano.
e.g. Mt. Chimborazo in Ecuador
Volcanic Belts
● Circum-Pacific Belt (Fire girdle of the Pacific or the fire ring of the Pacific). It
extends across the Kamchatka Peninsula, Kurile Islands, the Islands of Japan,
Philippines, New Guinea, New Zealand and the Soloman Islands.
● Major volcanic peaks in the circumpacific belt includes Mt. Krakatoa, Mt. Saint
Helens, Mt. Ruapehu, Mt. Fuji, Mt. Popo Catepte, Mt. Ojas Del Salado, Mt. Okmok etc.
● Mid-Continental Belt (Volcanic zones of convergent continental plate
Margins). It includes volcanoes of Alpine mountain chain, the Mediterranean sea
and the fault zone of Eastern Africa of Stromboli, Vesuvius, Etna, Kilimanjaro etc.
● Mid-Atlantic Belt, in which the volcanoes are fissure eruption type, e.g. Iceland,
Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Azores etc.

Rocks
● An aggregate of one or more minerals
found on the surface of Earth is known as
Rock.
● Rocks may be hard, soft and varied in
colours.
● Various Minerals are obtained from rocks.
Rocks are classified in three main types
depending on the process of their formation
(i) Igneous (ii) Sedimentary
(iii) Metamorphic
Igneous Rocks
● Formed due to the cooling, solidification
and crystallisation of hot and molten
magma.
● They are known as the primary rocks as
all the other rocks are formed directly or
indirectly from the igneous rocks.
● It is believed that the igneous rocks are
formed during each period of geological
history of Earth.
● They are hard, granular and crystalline
rocks, less affected by chemical
weathering.
● Moreover, it does not have any fossil or
does not form any strata or layers of lava.
CLASSIFICATION OF
IGNEOUS ROCKS
On the basis of Mode of Occurrence
● Intrusive Rocks They are formed due to
the solidification of rising magma below
the surface of the Earth, e.g. Granite,
Lapolith, Batholiths, Sills etc
● Extrusive Rocks They are formed
due to cooling and solidification of hot
and molten magma at the Earth
surface, e.g. Basalt, Gabbro etc.
On the basis of Silica Content
● Acidic : It has more silica content e.g.
Granite.
● Basic : It has less amount of silica
content e.g. Gabbro.
Sedimentary Rocks
● The word ‘Sedimentary’ is derived from
the Latin word sedimentum, which
means settling.
● It is formed due to the aggregation and
compaction of sediments derived from
the older rocks or dead remains of
plants, animals and contains fossils of
plants.
● The sedimentary rocks can be
classified on the basis of the nature of
sediments : mechanically, chemically
and organically formed rocks.

● These are the changed form of Igneous
and Sedimentary rocks.
● These are the rocks, which change
either in form or composition without
disintegration.
● Already formed igneous, sedimentary
or even metamorphic rocks are
changed to other forms and this
process is called metamorphosis.
● The agents of metamorphism are heat,
compression and solution.

Mountains
Based on their mode of formation four main
types of mountain can be distinguished.
Fold Mountains
● It is formed due to the face to face
orogenetic movements generated by
endogenetic forces.
● Example of fold moutains : Himalayas,
Alps, Andes, Rockies, Atlas etc.
On the basis of age, fold mountains are
grouped into
(a) Young/New Fold Mountains It came
into existence after the continental
drift and plate movements. e.g.
Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alps.
Himalayas are regarded as the
youngest mountains in the world.
(b) Old Fold Mountains They were
once young fold mountains. But
now, they have denuded due to
erosional processes.
e.g. Pennines (Europe), Appalachians
(US), Aravallis (India) etc.
Block Mountains
● It is formed when great block of Earth’s
crust may be raised or lowered due to
tectonic activities.
● The land between the two paralled
faults either rises forming Block
mountains or horsts or it subsides into a
depression termed as Rift valley or
Graben.
● Example of Block mountain : Vindhyan
and Satpura in India, the Vosges in France
and Black forest in Germany (through
which Rhine river flows).
Volcanic Mountains
● They are formed due to the accumulation
of volcanic material.
● They are also called Mountains of
Accumulation.
● Examples : Mt Fuji (Japan), Cotopaxi in
Andes, Vesuvius and Etna in Italy, Mt
Mayon (Philippines) etc.
Residual or Dissected Mountains
● They are formed as a result of erosion of
plateaus and high planes by various
agents of erosion.
● Examples : Catskill mountains of New
York, Sierras of Central Spain, Highlands
of Scotland, Parasnath, Girnar, Deccan
Plateau and Rajmahal of India.

According to their mode of formation and
their physical appearance, plateaus may
be grouped into the following types:
Tectonic Plateau These are formed by
Earth movements which cause uplift.
They are normally of a considerable size
and fairly uniform altitude.
● Examples of Tectonic Plateau are:
Tibetan Plateau between the
Himalayas and the Kunlun and the
Bolivian Plateau between two ranges of
the Andes.
● When plateau are enclosed by Fold
moutains, they are known as
Intermont Plateau. e.g. Bolivian
Plateau.
Volcanic Plateau These are formed by
accumulation of lava. e.g. North-Western
part of Deccan Plateau (India).
Dissected Plateau Through the continual
process of weathering and erosion by
running water, ice and winds, high extensive
plateau are gradually worn down, and their
surface becomes irregular. For example, the
Scottish Highlands.
Plains
● A relatively low-lying and flat land surface
with the least difference between its
highest and lowest points is called a Plain.
● The plains are divided into structural,
erosional and depositional plains.
Classification of Plains
Structural
Plain
Erosional Plain Depositional
Plain
Formed
due to the
uplift of a
part of the
sea floor
e.g. the
Great Plain
of USA.
Formed when the
elevated tract of
land is worn down
to a plain by the
process of
erosion. e.g. Plain
of North Canada.
Formed by
filling up of
sediments into
depressions
along the
foothills, lakes
and seas e.g.
Indo Ganga
Plain.
ATMOSPHERE
Atmosphere is a thick gaseous envelope
surrounding the Earth from all sides and
attached to the Earth through the force of
gravity.
Significance of Atmosphere
● Acts as a filter because it absorbs the
harmful Ultraviolet radiation.
● Source of various life supporting gases
such as oxygen, carbon dioxide etc.
● Supports life forms in biosphere.
Extent of Atmosphere
● Though the exact attitude of atmosphere
is not known, but it is estimated that it
extends till 10,000 km above the Earth’s
surface.
● The vertical distribution of atmospheric
layers is not uniform.
● Almost 98% of atmospheric mass is
limited to an altitude of 30 km from the
surface of Earth.
144 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Composition of Atmosphere
● The atmosphere is composed of gases, water vapour and particulates.
● Gases such as Helium, Ozone and Hydrogen etc are present in traces.
● Ozone gas absorbs the ultraviolet radiations and protects the biosphere from its
adverse impact.
Layers of Atmosphere
Troposphere
● It extends upto an average altitude of 18
km from the Earth’s surface. Thickness
varies from 8 km at the poles to 18 km at
the equator.
● At every 165 m, there is a drop of 1° C (or
6 4. ° C per km). This is called Normal
Lapse Rate of Temperature.
● Tropopause separates troposphere from
stratosphere.
● This layer accounts for practically the
entire water vapour, all dust particles and
most of the Carbon dioxide contained in
the atmosphere. Due to this all weather
phenomena such as condensation,
precipitation and storms etc occur in the
troposphere only.
Stratosphere
● The stratosphere extends up to about 50
km, where stratopause separates it from
the mesosphere.
● In this layer, the temperature increases
with increase in height. This phenomenon
is known as temperature inversion.
● The temperature rises in this layer from
about–60°C at the tropopause to 0°C at
stratopause.
● The part of the stratosphere, in which there
is a concentration of ozone is often called
ozonosphere. It absorbs ultraviolet
radiation, which is harmful for life forms in
the biosphere.
● Stratosphere is free from dust
particles and also from atmospheric
turbulence. Hence, this layer is
considered ideal for flying of jet
aircrafts.
Mesosphere
● Mesosphere extends above the
stratopause up to a height of about 80
km.
● In this layer, the temperature
decreases with height like in the
troposphere and it falls from about
0° C at its base to about – 100° C at an
height of 80 km. It is considered the
coldest layer of the atmosphere.
● The upper limit of the mesosphere is
marked by the Mesopause, a
transitional layer separating it from
the ionosphere.
● Meteoroids burn in this layer which
prevents them from colliding with the
Earth’s surface.
Ionosphere
● Ionosphere is located above the
mesosphere and extends up to about
600 km. This layer is called
ionosphere because it contains
electrically charged ions that reflect
the radio waves back to the Earth
which makes radio communication
possible. Absorption of solar radiation
by ionised particles causes an increase
in temperature with increasing height
in the ionosphere.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 145
The percentage composition of the various gases in atmosphere upto 50 km is given below:
Gases Percentage Composition Significance
Nitrogen 78.08% Acts as dilutent and is generally chemically inactive.
Oxygen 21% Inhaled by biotic components for survival. Oxygen is
also essential for combustion of burning matter.
Argon 0.93% Inert gas.
Carbon
dioxide
0.03% Being a greenhouse gas, it maintains the
temperature of the lower atmosphere.
Neon 0.0018% Inert gas
Helium 0.0005% Inert gas
Thermosphere
● The zone between the 85 km and 600 km above the surface is often called
Thermosphere. In this layer, the temperature increases with increasing altitude. The
upper limit of the thermosphere, the thermopause is generally taken at an altitude of
about 600 km.
● The day temperature at 600 km altitude exceed 1400° C while night temperature
remain about 225° C .
● The upper part of the thermosphere contains only the lighter gases like helium and
hydrogen.
Exosphere and Magnetosphere
● The outermost part of the atmosphere of the Earth is called Exosphere.
● This zone of the atmosphere is about 10,000 km thick.
● The upper limit of the exosphere is uncertain as this layer acts as a transitional layer
between the Earth’s atmosphere and the outer space. The outer part of the exosphere
is called Magnetosphere.
Chemical Composition of the Atmosphere
On the basis of chemical composition, the atmosphere is divided into
● Homosphere The atmosphere upto 80 km altitude is known as homosphere. There is
a homogeneous composition of various gases like nitrogen, oxygen, argon, CO2
etc. in
the Homosphere. Due to growing industrialisation, the homogeneity of this layer has
been disturbed.
● Heterosphere This layer starts from 80 km and coincides with the thermosphere.
There are distinct layers of gases in the atmosphere, which are arranged according to
their mean molecular weights. Four distinct layers of gases are formed – N2
, O, He, H.

Insolation
● Solar radiation that is intercepted by
the Earth is known as Insolation.
¡ Insolation is measured with the help of
Pyranometers.
The amount of insolation depends on
following factors:
(i) The area and nature of the surface.
(ii) The inclination of the rays of the Sun.
(iii) Distance between the Earth and the
Sun.
(iv) Length of the day.
(v) The transparency of the atmosphere.
● As the angle of the Sun’s rays decreases
poleward, the amount of insolation
received also decreases in that direction.
● The Earth’s surface does not absorb all
the energy that it receives. The
proportion of the solar radiation
reflected back from the surface is called
Albedo.
● On an average, insolation is highest
near the equator, marginally lower at
the tropics and lowest at the poles.
Heat Budget of the Earth
● The Earth receives energy continuously
from the Sun but its temperature is still
almost constant. This is because the
atmosphere loses an amount of heat
equal to the amount of heat gain
through insolation. This mechanism of
maintaining the balance between
incoming and outgoing heat in the
atmosphere is called the Heat Budget
or Heat Balance.
● Let us assume that 100 units of energy
reach the top of the atmosphere of the
Earth. 14 units are absorbed directly
by the atmosphere and 35 units are lost
to space through reflection.
● The remaining 51 units reach the Earth’s
surface and are absorbed by the Earth
due to which the surface gets heated.
● The heated surface of the Earth starts
radiating energy in the form of long waves
and this process is called Terrestrial
Radiation.
● Out of the total 51 units given up by the
surface in the form of terrestrial
radiation, the atmosphere (mainly CO2
and water vapour) absorbs about 34
units and the remaining 17 units escape
to space.
● In this way, the atmosphere receives a
total of 14 + 34 = 48 units and this
amount is radiated back to space by the
atmosphere.
● The total loss of energy to space thus
amounts to 100 units. 35 units reflected
by the atmosphere, 17 units lost as
terrestrial radiation and 48 units from the
atmosphere.
● In this way, no net gain or loss of energy
occurs on the Earth’s surface.
● At equator, the amount of incoming
radiation is more than outgoing radiation,
whereas the amount of outgoing
radiation is more than incoming
radiation in polor regions. The transport
of surplus heat from equator to poles is
known as ‘Meridional Transport of Heat’.
Atmospheric Pressure
● Air is a mixture of several gases having
their own weight. The pressure exerted
by air due to its weight is called
atmospheric pressure on the Earth’s
surface.
● Atmospheric pressure is neither the same
for all the regions nor the same for one
region all the time.
● Atmospheric pressure is affected by
various factors such as altitude,
temperature and Earth’s rotation.
Influence on the
Atmospheric Pressure
Altitude Air pressure increases, when air
descends. This is due to the decrease in
volume of the air. When air raises its
volume increases and the pressure of its
molecules is spread over a larger area so, its
pressure decreases.
148 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Temperature The pressure of air rises, when its temperature falls. Low temperature at
the poles cause the air to contract–high pressure develops; whereas the high temperature
along the equator cause the air to expand–low pressure develops.
THE GLOBAL PRESSURE BELTS
Equatorial Low Pressure Belt
● It is located on either side of the
geographical equator in a zone extending
between 5°N and 5°S. Its location is not
stationary and there is a seasonal drift of
this belt with the Northward (summer
solstice) and Southward (winter solstice)
migration of the Sun.
● It is thermally induced because of the
intense heating of the ground surface by the
almost vertical Sun rays.
● It represents the zone of convergence of
North-East and South-East trade winds.
This convergence zone is characterised by
light and feeble winds. And because of the
frequent calm conditions, this belt is known
as a belt of calm or doldrums.
Subtropical High Pressure Belt
● It extends between 30° to 35° latitudes in
both the hemispheres.
● It is not thermally induced, but dynamically
induced as it is formed by the rotation of the
Earth and sinking and settling down of
winds.
● Here the convergence of winds at
higher altitude above this zone results
in the subsidence of air. Subsidence
results in concentration of their
volume and ultimately causes high
pressure in this zone.
● This zone of high pressure is also
called Horse Latitude.
Sub-Polar Low Pressure
Belt
● It extends between 60° to 65°
latitudes in both the hemisphere.
● The low pressure belt does not appear
to be thermally induced because
there is low temperature throughout
the year. Naturally, there should have
been high pressure belt instead of low
pressure belt. But as it is dynamically
induced low pressure is formed.
● It is more developed and regular in
Southern hemisphere than in
Northern hemisphere because of the
over dominance of water (ocean) in
the Southern hemisphere.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 149
Polar High Pressure Belt
● High pressure persists at the poles throughout
the year because of the prevalence of very low
temperature all the year round.
● Thus, it is thermally induced pressure belt.
Shifting of Wind Belts
● The entire system of pressure and wind belts
follows the movement of midday Sun. In June,
when the Sun is over the Tropic of Cancer, all
the belts move about 5 10 °− ° North of their
average position.
● In the same manner, when the Sun is overhead
at the Tropic of Capricorn in December, all the
belts shift 5 10 ° − ° South of their average
position.
Wind System
● The pressure difference is the major cause of
the genesis of the wind system. The air
moves from high pressure to low pressure.
● The slope of pressure from high to low is called
as pressure gradient, which is also called as
barometric slope.
● The imaginary line joining the points having
same pressure is called isobars. Ideally, the
direction of air movement should be
perpendicular to the isobars but the winds are
deflected due to the Coriolis force caused by
the rotation of the Earth.
Wind Direction
and Related Laws
● The Coriolis force generated due to the
rotation of Earth acts as a deflective force to
the wind direction. Because of the Coriolis
force, all the winds are deflected to the right in
the Northern hemisphere while they are
deflected to the left in the
Southern hemisphere with
respect to the rotating Earth.
● This is referred to as Ferrel’s Law.
The Coriolis force is absent along
the equator, but increases
progressively towards the pole.
● The factors that control the air
motion on Earth’s surface are as
follows:
¡ Pressure gradient
¡ Rotation of Earth and Coriolis
force
¡ Frictional force
¡ Centrifugal action of wind
● The winds blowing parallel to the
isobars generally at the height of
600 m is called geostrophic wind.
Primary Wind Movement
(Permanent Winds)
These winds include trade wind,
westerlies and polar winds.
Trade Winds
● These are steady currents of air
blowing from the sub-tropical high
pressure belt towards the
equatorial low pressure belt.
● Under the influence of the Coriolis
forces they flow from the
North-East in the Northern
hemisphere and from South-East
in the Southern hemisphere.
Westerlies
● The permanent winds blowing
from the sub-tropical high
pressure belt to the sub-polar low
pressure belt in both the
hemisphere is called Westerlies.
● The general direction of the
westerlies is South-West to NorthEast in the Northern hemisphere
and North-West to South-East in
the Southern hemisphere.
● Because of the dominance of the
land masses in the Northern
hemisphere the Westerlies become
more complex and complicated.
They become less effective during
summer seasons and more
vigorous during winter seasons.

150 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
The Westerlies become more rigorous in the Southern hemisphere because of the lack
of land and dominance of water surface.
● Their velocity increases Southward and they become stormy so they are called roaring
forties between 40°-50° South latitudes, furious fifties at 50° South latitude and
screaming sixties at 60° South latitude.
Polar Winds
Polar winds blows from polar high pressure belt to sub-polar low pressure belt. They are
North-Easterly in Northern hemisphere and South-Easterly in the Southern hemisphere.
Secondary Wind Movement
Secondary wind movements include those wind patterns that are not permanent like the
primary winds. Secondary Wind Movement includes seasonal periodic winds. Seasonal
winds are the winds, which reverse their direction completely every 6 months with
change in season. The best example is Monsoon winds.
CYCLONES
Cyclones are the centres of low pressure surrounded by closed isobars having increasing
pressure outwards due to low pressure at the centre, there is continuous flow of air
towards the centre.
● Air blows inward in anti-clockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere.
● Air blows inward in clockwise direction in the Southern hemisphere.
Cyclones are mainly of two types
(i) Tropical Cyclone (ii) Temperate Cyclone

Differences Between Tropical and
Temperate Cyclones
Tropical Cyclone Temperate Cyclone
They are found in the
trade wind belt,
between 8-20 degree
North and South. But
not found between 0 to
8 degree as there is no
coriolis force there.
Normally found
between 30 to 65
degree North and
South in the sub-polar
frontal zone, where
cold polar air mass
meets the warm
tropical air mass.
It travels from East to
West in the Easterly
wind belt.
It moves from West to
East embedded in the
Westerly wind belt.
Tropical cyclones are
much smaller with a
diameter of about 200
to 500 km.
They form over a
much large area with
a diameter 300 to
1500 km.
Tropical cyclones are
non frontal in nature.
Temperate cyclones
are frontal in nature.
It is formed only over
the oceans.
It is formed either
over con- tinents or
over the oceans.
Tropical cyclone can
form only in the summer.
They can form both in
summer as well as in
winter.
It does not have
definite lifecycle and
they dissipate as they
pass over the land
surface.
It takes more time to
dissipate as it has a
more definite
lifecycle.
Anticyclone
● They are the wind systems, which have
the highest air pressure at the centre
and lowest at the outer margins.
¡ The wind blows from the centre to
outward in clockwise direction in
Northern hemisphere and from centre to
outward in anti-clockwise direction in
Southern hemisphere.
● They are high pressure system and
common in sub-tropical belts and
practically absent in the equatorial
region.
● They are generally associated with
rainless fair weather and that’s why they
are known as weatherless phenomena.
Thunderstorms
● Thunderstorms are local storms
characterised by swift upward
movement of air and heavy rainfall with
cloud thunder and lightening.
● Structurally, thunderstorms consist of
several convective cells, which are
characterised by strong updraft of air.
Tornado
● Tornadoes are very strong tropical
cyclones of smaller size. In the
Mississippi valley (US), they are called
Twisters.
● They are more destructive than cyclones
as the speed of winds is very high,
exceeding 220 km per hour.
Jet Stream
● The strong and rapidly moving
circumpolar Westerly air circulation in a
narrow belt of a few hundred kilometres
width in the upper limit of troposphere
is called Jet Stream.
● Their circulation path is wavy and
meandering.
● The extent of the Jet Streams narrows
down during the summer season
because of their Northward shifting
while these extend up to 20° North
latitude during winter season.
HUMIDITY
● Humidity of air refers to the content of
the water vapour present in the air at a
particular time and place. Humidity is
measured by an instrument called
hygrometer. Another instrument used
for the same purpose is sling
psychrometer.
The atmospheric humidity is expressed in a
number of ways such as:
Way of Measurement
of Humidity
Definition
Humidity Capacity The capacity of air
of certain volume at
certain temperature
to retain maximum
amount of moisture
content.
Absolute Humidity The total weight of
moisture content
per volume of air at
definite
temperature is
called absolute
humidity.
Specific Humidity The mass of the
water vapour in
grams contained in
a kilogram of air. It
represents the
actual quantity of
moisture present in
a definite amount
of air.
Relative Humidity
Relative Humidity
= ×
Absolute humidity
Humidity capacity
100
It is the ratio of the
amount of water
vapour actually
present in the air
having definite
volume and
temperature (i.e.
absolute humidity)
to the maximum
amount the air can
hold (i.e. humidity
capacity).
Condensation and Its Forms
● When the relative humidity reaches
100%, the air is completely saturated. The
air temperature is said to be at dew-point.
● It is the change of physical state of matter
from gaseous phase into liquid phase and
is the reverse of vaporisation. The
process of condensation depends upon
the amount of Relative Humidity present
in the air.
● Smog (Smoke + Fog) is a form of fog that
occurs in areas, where the air contains a
large amount of smoke.
● Fog is made from the droplets of water
suspended in the lower layer of the
atmosphere. Fog is not considered as a
form of precipitaion. Visibility of less
than 1 km is the internationally
recognised definition of fog.
● Haze is formed by water particles that
have condensed in the atmosphere and
visibility lie between 1 km to 2 km.
● Frost is the moisture on the ground
surface that condenses directly into ice,
i.e. when condensation occurs below
freezing point.
RAINFALL
On the basis of its origin, Rainfall may be
classified into three main types
● Convectional Rainfall It occurs due to
thermal convection currents caused
due to insolational heating of ground
surface.
● Orographic Rainfall occurs due to
ascent of air forced by a mountain
barrier.
● Frontal Rainfall or Cyclonic It occurs
due to upward movement of air caused
by convergence of cold air masses
against warm air masses.

n Rainfall associated with the
temperate cyclone occurs,
when two extensive air
masses of different physical
properties converge.
n In temperate regions, two
extensive air masses of
similar physical properties
converge to form temperate
cyclones that cause heavy
rainfall in these regions.
Clouds
● Clouds are the masses of small water droplets or tiny ice crystals.
● Clouds are classified according to their appearance, form and height.
There are four groups
(i) High Clouds 6 to 20 km
(ii) Middle Clouds 2.5 to 6 km
(iii) Low Clouds below 2.5 km
(iv) Clouds of great vertical extent upto 9000 m
The different types of clouds are given Latin names, which are the combination of the
following words:
¡ Cirrus means looking like a feather and used to describe the very high clouds.
¡ Cumulus means looking like a heap. It is used to describe the clouds having flat bases
and rounded tops.
¡ Stratus means lying in level sheets. It is used for layer type of clouds.
¡ Alto means at middle altitudes.
¡ Nimbus means rain cloud.

size they are: Pacific ocean, Atlantic ocean,
Indian ocean and Arctic ocean. The average
depth of oceans on Earth is about 4 km.
Major Oceans
Ocean Important Information
Pacific It is the largest and deepest of ocean.
Most of the Islands of the ocean are of
volcanic or coral origin. Mariana
Trench, the world’s deepest trench with
depth 11033 km is in Pacific ocean.
Atlantic It has the longest coast line. It is the
busiest ocean for trade and commerce
since its sea routes connect the two
most industrialised regions, namely
Western Europe and North-Eastern
United States of America. Atlantic ocean
is still widening. Puerto Rico Trench is
the deepest point of this ocean.
Indian Only ocean named after a country. It is
deeper than the Atlantic ocean. Here
the number of continental islands is
more than that of volcanic islands.
Sunda Trench (earlier known as Java
Trench) is the deepest point of this
ocean.
Arctic It is the smallest ocean and lies within
the Arctic circle. The North pole lies in
the middle of the Arctic ocean. Most of
the part of the ocean is frozen and
hence it is least saline and the
shallowest among all the oceans.
Nansei Trench is the deepest point of
this ocean.
158 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Relief of the Ocean Basin
Continental Shelf
● The shallow submerged extension of the
continent is called the continental shelf.
● Extends to a depth of 100 fathoms
(1 fathoms = 18. m).
● Average width 70 km; average slope of
about 1°.
● Continental shelf covers 8.6% of total
area of the oceans. It extends over 13.3%
of the Atlantic ocean 5.7% of Pacific
ocean and 4.2% of Indian ocean.
● If mountains extend along the coast, the
shelf will be narrower.
● About 20% of oil and gas are found here.
They also provide the richest fishing
grounds in the world.
Continental Slope
● Extends seawards from the continental
shelf.
● Depth-200-2000 metres.
● Average slope is 2 to 5 degrees.
● The boundary between shelf and slope is
known as shelf break, which is a seaward
edge with an abrupt drop.
● They cover about 8.5% of the total ocean
area.
Continental Rise
● Continental rise is an area at the foot of
the slope, slightly rising due to the
accumulation of debris transported over
the slope.
● Average slope-0.5° to 1°.
● Oil deposits occur here.
Abyssal or the Deep
Sea Plains
● It is an underwater vast and flat plain on
the oceanic floor.
● Average depth 3000 m to 6000 m.
● It covers about 40% of total oceanic area.
● Parts of the Abyssal plains are occupied
by raised ridges or submarine mountains
and by very deep trenches or canyons.
Deeps/Trenches
● Trenches are narrow and steep side
depressions. Trenches are formed, when
one plate of Earth’s crust is subducted
below the other.
● Mariana trench (Challenger deep) is the
deepest point in the world situated in the
NW Pacific ocean, near Philippines. It is
more than 11 km deep.
Oceanic Ridges
● Oceanic Ridges are formed by the
volcanic activity along the divergent
boundary of plates.
● It is a thousand km long and hundreds of
km wide mountain range on the oceanic
floor.
● Their summits may rise above the sea
level in the form of Islands i.e. Azores
Island of Iceland.

Sea Mounts and Guyouts
● A ridge rising more than 1000 m
above the ocean floor is called
seamount. Flat topped sea mounts
are called Guyouts.
● Both of them are formed by the
volcanic activity.
● Largest number of sea mounts and
Guyouts are found in the Pacific
ocean.
Submarine Canyons
● Submarine canyons are the deep
gorges on the ocean floor and are
restricted to the continental
shelves, slopes and rises.
● Many submarine canyons are
found along the mouths of major
rivers e.g. Hudson canyon.
CORAL REEFS
● Coral reefs are formed due to
accumulation and the compaction
of skeletons of lime secreting
organisms known as Coral Polyps.
● Corals are found mainly in the
tropical oceans and seas because
they require high mean annual
temperature ranging between 20°C
to 25°C.
● Corals do not live in deeper waters
due to lack of sufficient sunlight
and oxygen.
On the basis of nature, shape and
mode of occurrence, the coral reefs are
classified into four types:
Fringing Reefs
● It develops along the continental
margins or along the islands.
● The seaward slope is steep and
vertical while the landward slope is
gentle.
● They are usually attached to the
coastal land, but occasionally they
are separated from the shore by a
shallow and narrow lagoon called
Boat Channel.
● These type of reefs are found near
Rameshwaram in the Gulf of
Mannar and Andamans.
Barrier Reefs
● The barrier reef lies at a distance away from
the coast. Hence, a broad lagoon separates the
reef and the shore.
● The Great Barrier Reef of Australia is the
largest barrier reef in the world. In India, it is
found in Nicobar and Lakshadweep.
Patch Reefs
● Patch reefs are isolated and discontinuous
patches lying shoreward of offshore reef
structures. These are found in the Palk Bay,
Gulf of Mannar and Gulf of Kutch.
Atoll
● A reef of narrow growing corals of horse shoe
shape and crowned with palm trees is called an
atoll.
● It is formed around an island or in an elliptical
form on a submarine platform.
● Funafuti atoll of Ellice Islands is a famous
atoll. They are also found in Lakshadweep and
Nicobar.
Coral Bleaching
When corals are stressed by changes in conditions
such as temperature, light or nutrients, they expel the
symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them
to turn completely white, this phenomenon is known
as coral bleaching.
SALINITY
● Salinity is defined as the total amount of salt
content in grams contained in 1 kg of sea
water and is expressed as part per
thousand. The oceanic salinity not only affects
the marine organism and plant community,
but also affects the physical properties of the
ocean such as temperature, pressure, density,
waves and currents.
● Average salinity in Southern hemisphere is
more than that of Northern hemisphere.
● Iso-halines represent the salinity distribution
in the surface of the sea. These are the lines
joining places having an equal degree of
salinity. The main source of salinity is
dissolution of the rocks of oceanic crust, which
contain various salts.
● Poles have minimum salinity because of
addition of fresh water in the form of icebergs
and excessive snowfall.
160 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● Variation in salinity causes
vertical circulation of water.
More saline water freezes slowly
while the boiling point of saline
water is higher than the fresh
water.
● Salinity also increases the
density of water.

Salinity on an average decreases
from equator to poles. The
highest salinity is recorded near
the tropics rather than the
equator because of the heavy
precipitation in the equatorial
region.
Factors Controlling
Oceanic Salinity
The salinity of oceans and
different seas depends on a
number of factors such as
evaporation, precipitation, influx
of the river water, prevailing wind,
ocean currents and sea waves etc.
Controlling
Factor
Relation with Salinity
Evaporation Greater the evaporation, higher the
salinity.
Precipitation Higher the precipitation, lower the salinity.
Influx of river
water
Big voluminuous rivers pour down
immense volume of fresh water into the
oceans and salinity is reduced at the
mouth.
Atmospheric
pressure
Anticyclonic conditions with stable air and
high temperature increases the salinity of
the surface water of the ocean.
Circulation
of oceanic
water
Ocean currents affect the spatial distribution
of salinity by mixing sea waters.
MOVEMENTS OF OCEANIC
WATER
Waves
● Waves are the oscillatory movements in water
mainly produced by winds, manifested by an
alternate rise and fall of the sea surface.
● The waves are the important agents of erosion in
the coastal regions, where they carve out various
landforms like caves, bays, gulfs, capes and cliffs.
● Seismic waves or Tsunamis are the waves caused
by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions at the sea
bottom.
● The Tsunamis, which hit the coast in South-East
Asia on 26th December, 2004, caused very heavy
damage in that region.
● Tsunamis in the Indonesian Islands of Sulawesi,
Java and Sumatra in 2018 killed many and injured
a large number of people.
Ocean Currents
● An ocean current is a continuous, directed
movement of ocean water generated by the forces
acting upon it, such as breaking waves, wind,
coriolis effect, temperature and salinity
differences and tides caused by the gravitation
pull of the Moon and the Sun.
● Ocean currents circulate in clockwise direction in
Northern hemisphere and in anti-clockwise
direction in Southern hemisphere.
Ocean currents are of two types:
(i) Warm Currents The ocean currents flowing
from lower latitude to higher latitude are
known as warm currents.
(ii) Cold Currents The ocean currents flowing
from higher latitude to lower latitude are
known as cold currents.

TIDES
● The periodic rise and fall of the sea level as a result of the gravitational forces between
the Earth, the Moon and the Sun is called a tide. The time interval between two tides
is 12 hours and 26 minutes.
Spring Tides
● When the Earth, the Moon and the Sun are in a straight line (SYZYGY) the Sun
assists the gravitational pull of the Moon, creating a condition of higher high tides and
lower low tides known as spring tides.
Neap Tides
● When the Sun and Moon are at right angles to the Earth (Quadrature), the Sun
partially reduces the gravitational pull of the Moon, producing lower high tides known
as a Neap tide.

THE CLIMATE OF
INDIA
● India has tropical monsoon type
of climate. It is greatly
influenced by the presence of
Himalayas in the North as they
block the cold air masses from
Central Asia. It is because of the
Himalayas that the monsoon
winds shed their water in India.
● The Tropic of Cancer (23.5°N)
divides India into two almost
equal climatic zones, namely,
the Northern zone (sub-tropical)
and the Southern zone (tropical).
● The sub-tropical climate of the
Northern zone gives it cold
winter season and hot summer
season.
● The Southern tropical climate
zone is warmer than the North
and does not have a clear cut
winter season.
The Southern zone has the
midday Sun almost vertically
overhead at least twice every year
and the Northern zone does not
have the midday Sun vertically
overhead during any part of the
year.
Factors Influencing
the Climate of India
The factors influencing the climate of India are as
follows:
● Location and Latitudinal extent The Tropic of
Cancer passes through the middle of the country.
The region to the South of Tropic of Cancer
experiences tropical climate, whereas the region
to the North of the Tropic of Cancer experiences
warm temperate climate.
● Distance from Sea The areas near to the sea
experience maritime climate, whereas the areas
away from the sea experience continental
climate.
● The Northern Mountain Range The Northern
Himalayan range protects India from the bitterly
cold and dry winds of Central Asia during winter.
Moreover, it acts as a physical barrier for the rain
bearing South-West monsoon.
● Physiography The physiography has great
impact on the major elements of climate such as
temperature, atmospheric pressure, direction of
wind and amount of rainfall.
● Monsoon Wind It is the most dominating factor
of Indian climate. The South-West summer
monsoon from the Arabian sea and the Bay of
Bengal bring rainfall to the entire country.
Besides the North-East winter monsoon
travelling from land to sea causes rainfall along
the Coromandel coast after acquiring moisture
from the Bay of Bengal.

Western Disturbances
These are the depressions generated over the
Mediterranean sea and enter India after
crossing over Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and
Pakistan under the influence of Westerly jet
stream. After reaching India, they move
Eastwards, causing light rain in the
Indo-Gangetic plains and snowfall in Himalayan
belt.
● Upper Air Circulation The upper air
circulation of India is dominated by a
westerly flow. An important component of
this flow is the Jet Stream. The Western
cyclonic disturbances experienced in
North and North Western parts of the
country are brought in by this Westerly
flow.
● Tropical Cyclones The tropical cyclones
generated in Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal
during the South-West monsoon and the
retreating monsoon seasons influence the
weather conditions of the Peninsular India.
● El Nino and La Nina El Nino is a narrow
warm current, which occasionally appears
off the coast of Peru in December by
temporarily replacing the cold Peru current.
● The warming of tropical Pacific waters
affect the global pattern of pressure and
wind systems including the monsoon
winds in the Indian ocean. La Nina is
the reverse of El-Nino. It is a harbinger
of heavy monsoon showers in India.
● Southern Oscillation Whenever the
surface level pressure is high over the
Indian ocean, there is low pressure over
the Pacific ocean and vice versa. This
inter-relation of high and low pressure
over the Pacific and the Indian ocean is
called Southern Oscillation.
Seasons in India
● Indian climate is characterised by
distinct seasonality. Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD) has
recognised the following four distinct
seasons:
(i) The cold season or winter season.
(ii) The hot weather season or
summer season.
(iii) The South-West monsoon season
or rainy season.
(iv) The season of the retreating
monsoon or cool season.

Climatic Regions of India
Trewartha’s Classification
● Dr Trewartha’s scheme has been most prominent of all classifications of the Indian
climatic regions. He presented a modified form of Koppen’s classification.
● Dr Trewartha’s classification divides India into four major regions of the A, B, C and H
types. The A type refers to tropical rainy climate, where high temperatures are
consistent. The B type stands for a dry climate with high temperatures, but little
rainfall. The C type indicates a region with dry winters, where there is low temperature
range between 0°C and 18°C. The H type indicates a mountain climate. The A, B, and
C types are further sub-divided.

AGRICULTURE IN
INDIA
India is essentially an agricultural land.
Two-thirds of its population still lives on
agriculture. Agriculture is a primary activity
which includes farming, animal rearing and
fishing. There are three crop seasons in
India
(i) Kharif Sown in June/July, harvested in
September/October. e.g. rice, jowar,
bajra, ragi, maize, cotton and jute.
(ii) Rabi Sown in October/December,
harvested in April/May e.g. wheat,
barley, peas, rapeseed, mustard,
grains.
(iii) Zaid They are raised between April
and June e.g. melon, watermelon,
cuccumber, toris, leafy and other
vegetables.

land is cleared mainly by tribal people by
felling and burning of trees and crops are
grown.
● Dry paddy, buck wheat, maize, small millets,
tobacco and sugarcane are the main crops
grown under this type of agriculture.
Intensive Farming
● This is a system of farming in which the
cultivator uses large amount of labour and
capital on a relatively small area.
● In regions, where the size of population is
big, but land is less, this type of farming is
done.
● Agriculture is done with the help of manual
labour.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● Ecology is a science, in which study of
organism is undertaken in relation to
their environment. This science
developed in response to the increasing
awareness of inter- relationships
between plants, animals and their
physical habitats.
● The term ecosystem was first used by
AG Tansley in 1935, who defined
ecosystem as a particular category of
physical system, consisting of organisms
and inorganic components in a relatively
stable equilibrium which is open and of
various sizes and kinds.
Components of Ecosystem
● Abiotic Components are the non-living
components, e.g. air, water, soil,
suspended particulate matter etc.
● Biotic Components includes plants,
animals and micro-organism.
● The living organism in an ecosystem
can be divided into three categories
Producers
● Producers are organisms that can make
organic energy resources from abiotic
components of the environment. They
produce their food themselves.
Consumers
● Consumers are those organisms that
gather energy by consuming organic
material from other organisms. Primary
consumers are those organisms, who
consume mainly producers. Primary
consumers are also known as Herbivores.
● Secondary consumers are those
organisms, who consume mainly
primary consumers. Tertiary consumers
are organisms that consume secondary
consumers. Tertiary consumers are
carnivores. Omnivores feed on both
producers and other consumers.
● Detritovores consume detritus
(dead material of plants and animals).
Decomposers
● Decomposers are organisms that break
down dead or decaying organisms.
Decomposers are heterotrophic which
means that they use organic substrates to
get their energy and carbon and
nutrients for their growth and
development e.g. bacteria and fungi.
Functions of Ecosystem
The main functions of an ecosystem are as
follows:
(i) Materials or nutrient cycle
(ii) Biological or ecological regulation
● Foodchain The flow of energy from of
one organism to another in a sequence of
food transfer is known as a foodchain. A
simple foodchain is like the following
Grass→ Insect→ Frogs→ Snake→ Hawk
● Food Web A network of foodchains or
feeding relationships, by which energy and
nutrients are passed on from one specie of
living organism to another is called food
web.
● Trophic Levels Trophic levels are the
feeding position in a foodchain such as
primary producers, herbivore, primary
carnivore etc. Generally, green plants
form the first trophic level, the
producers, herbivores form the second
trophic level, while carnivores and
omnivores form the third and even the
fourth trophic levels.
● Ecological Pyramid An ecological
pyramid is a graphical representation
designed to show the number of
organisms, energy relationships and
biomass of an ecosystem. They are also
called Eltonian Pyramids after Charles
Elton, who developed the concept of
ecological pyramids. Producer organisms
(usually green plants) from the base of
the pyramid, with succeeding levels
above representing the different tropic
levels.
● Succeeding levels in the pyramid
represent the dependence of the
organisms at a given level on the
organisms at lower level.
● Pyramid of Biomass Biomass is
renewable organic (living) material. A
pyramid of biomass is a representation of
the amount of energy contained in
biomass at different trophic levels for a
particular time.
● It is measured in grams per meter or
calories per meter. This demonstrates the
amount of matter lost between trophic
levels.
● Pyramid of Energy The pyramid of
energy represents the total amount of
energy consumed at each trophic level.
219
ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● An energy pyramid is always upright as the total amount of energy available for
utilisation in the layers above is less than the energy available in the lower levels.
● Biome Biome is a large natural ecosystem, wherein we study the total assemblage of
plant and animal communities. Biosphere is the largest ecosystem on the Earth,
divided into biomes.
● Ecological Niche Organisms in ecosystem get evolved for particular task. This task or
role, which an organism plays in ecosystem is called as ecological niche.

POLLUTION
Environmental pollution is the effect of
undesirable changes in our surroundings
that have harmful effects on plants, animals
and human beings.
Pollutants Pollutants are substances which
cause pollution. They could be in any from
solid, liquid or gaseous.
● A primary pollutant is substance emitted
directly from a source.
● A secondary pollution is not directly
emitted as such, but forms, when other
pollutants (primary pollutants) react in
the atmosphere.
Primary pollutants
● Sulphur dioxide (SO )2
, nitrogen oxides
(NO )2
, carbon monoxide (CO), chlorofluoro carbons (CFCs), carbon dioxide
(CO )2
, Suspended Particulate Matter
(SPM) and Ammonia (NH )3
volatile
organic compounds, toxic metals etc.
Secondary pollutants
1. Particulate matter formed from
gaseous primary pollutants and
compounds in photochemical smog,
such as nitrogen dioxide.
2. Ground level ozone (O )3
formed from
N2
and Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOCs).
3. Peroxyacety l Nitrate (PAN) similarly
formed from NO2
and VOCs.
Air Pollution
It is the contamination of air by a variety of
substances causing health problems and
damaging our environment.
Air Pollutants
Some of the most common air pollutants are
as follows.
● Carbon Monoxide (CO) is produced from
incomplete combustion of fuel such as
natural gas, coal and wood.
● It is also produced in tobacco smoke. It
slows our reflexes and makes us feel
sleepy.
● Carbon Dioxide ( ) CO2
is the principal
greenhouse gas and is primarily
responsible for the greenhouse effect. It
can be formed from all types of common
human activities, such as burning fuels
and even breathing.
● Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were
generally used in great quantities in
industry, for refrigeration and
air-conditioning and in consumer
products.
● Ozone ( )O3
gas occurs naturally in the
upper atmosphere where it shields the
Earth from the Sun’s dangerous
ultraviolet rays. When found at ground
level, it’s a pollutant.
● Nitrogen Oxide and Sulphur Dioxide
are major contributors to smog and acid
rain. These gases both react with
volatile organic compounds to form
smog, which can cause respiratory
problems in humans. Acid rain can
harm vegetation, change the chemistry
of river and lake water by lowering the
pH which is harmful to animal life and
react with the marble statues and
buildings to decompose them.
Controls/Measures of Air
Pollution
● Suitable fuel selection
● Modification in industrial processes
● Correct selection of manufacturing sites
● More efficient engines
● Awareness for using public transport so
that air pollution is minimised
Water Pollution
● It is the contamination of water bodies
(e.g. lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and
groundwater). Water pollution occurs
when pollutants are discharged directly
or indirectly into water bodies without
adequate treatment to remove harmful
compounds.
● Biological Oxygen Demond (BOD) It
is a measurement of amount of
dissolved oxygen that is used by aerobic
micro-organisms when decomposing
organic matter in water. It is an
important water quality parameter and
is an indicator of organic pollution.
Control/Measures of Water
Pollution
● Mass social awareness should be
generated.
● Ground water pollution can be
eliminated by maintaining strict
restrictions regarding waste disposal.
● Industrial effluents should be effectively
recycled, before releasing in water.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 221
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● Government Initiatives National Water
Policy, 2002, Water (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Act, 1974,
establishment of pollution control boards,
oil spill response centre etc are some
government initiatives to control water
pollution.
● National River Conservation Plan,
Namami Gange programme have also
been started to cleanup the precious rivers
in India.
Noise Pollution
● Noise can be taken as a group of loud,
non-harmonious sounds or vibrations that
are unpleasant and irritating to ear.
Decibel is the standard for the
measurement of noise.
● Noise pollution creates many diseases
such as hypertension, hearing loss, sleep
disturbances etc. Continuous noise can
create panic situations or even increase
frustration levels. It also impacts the
health of wildlife on land as well as oceans.
● Under the Environment Protection Act,
1986, the Central Government has come
up with rules to curb the noise pollution.
Land Pollution
● It refers to degradation or destruction of
Earth’s surface and soil, directly or
indirectly as a result of human activities. It
explains any activity that lessens the
quality or productivity of the land as an
ideal place for agriculture, forestation,
construction, etc.
Causes of Land Pollution
● Deforestation and soil erosion.
● Agricultural Activities Use of highly toxic
fertilisers and pesticides as well as mining
activities.
● Overcrowded Landfills Garbage which
cannot be recycled become a part of the
landfills.
● Industrialisation Creation of more waste
by industries that needs to be disposed off.
● Nuclear Waste The left over radioactive
material contains harmful and toxic
chemicals that can affect human health.
They are dumped beneath the Earth to
avoid any casuality.
● Sewage Treatment Large amount of solid
waste is leftover once the sewage has been
treated. The leftover material is sent to
landfill site which pollutes the
environment.
Solutions for Land Pollution
● Make people aware about the concept
of reduce, recycle and reuse.
● Practicing organic farming which uses
no chemical pesticides and fertilisers
in agricultural activities.
● Avoid buying packages items as they
will lead to garbage.
● No littering on ground and proper
disposal of garbage.
● Using bio-degradable products.
● Organic gardening and organic food.
e-Waste
It is a term used to cover almost all types
of Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(EEE) that could enter into the waste
stream. Although e-waste is a general
term, it can be considered to cover TVs,
computers, mobile phones, white goods
(e.g. fridges, washing machines, dryers
etc) home entertainment and stereo
systems, toys, toasters, kettles and almost
any households or business item with
circuitry or electrical components with
power or battery supply which have been
discarded.
Radioactive Pollution
● It is the release of any radioactive
material into the environment.
Radioactive pollution can be very
dangerous because radiation mutates
DNA, causing abnormal growth and
possibly cancer and this radiation
remains in the environment for years,
slowly diminishing over time.
Radioactive pollution is mainly caused
by nuclear accidents, nuclear
explosion, accident during production
or use of radioactive materials. There
are techniques used to manage this
pollution, however, we are far from
keeping our planet clean of radioactive
pollution.
Biodiversity
● Biodiversity refers to the variety within
the living world. The term is commonly
used to describe the number, variety
and variability of living organisms.
● Often used as a synonym of Life on the
Earth. It means genetic variation,
species variation or ecosystem
variation within an area, biome or
planet.
222
● Biodiversity is often seen in the terms of
three fundamental and hierarchically
related levels of biological organisation.
● Genetic diversity represents the
heritable variation within and between
population of organisms.
● Species diversity refers to number of
species in a site or habitat.
● Ecosystem diversity refers to diversity
of different organisms at the ecosystem,
habitat or community level.
Biodiversity Hotspots
● A biodiversity hotspot is a bio-geographic
region with a significant reservoir of
biodiversity that is under threat from
humans. The concept of biodiversity
hotspots was given by Norman Myers.
● To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot a
region must meet two strict criterias. It
must contain at least 0.5% or 1500
species of vascular plants as endemics
and it has to have lost at least 70% of its
primary vegetation. India has two
biodiversity hotspots—Western Ghats
and Eastern Himalayas. Indo-Burma
Region and Sundaland (including
Nicobar group of Islands).
Biodiversity Conservation
Conservation is planned management of
natural resources to retain the balance in
nature and retain the diversity. It
emphasises on the wise use of natural
resources by accepting the idea of
sustainable development. Conservation of
biodiversity is carried out in the following
ways.
Method of Conservation
The method of conservation of biodiversity
can be classified into two groups.
In-Situ (On Site)
Conservation include protection of plants
and animals within their natural habitats
or in protected areas. Protected areas are
land or sea dedicated to protect and
maintain biodiversity. Examples are
Biosphere Reserves, National Parks,
Wildlife Sanctuaries, etc.
Ex-Situ (Off Site)
Conservation of plants and animals outside
their natural habitats. These include
botanical gardens, zoos, gene banks of seed,
tissue culture and cryopreservation.
Threatened Species
Threatened species are any species
(including animals, plants, fungi, etc.)
which are vulnerable to endangering in the
near future. Species that are threatened
are sometimes characterised by the
population dynamics measure of critical
depensation, a mathematical measure of
biomass related to population growth rate.
This quantitative metric is one method of
evaluating the degree of danger.
IUCN
The International Union for Conservation
of Nature (IUCN) is the foremost authority
on threatened species, and treats
threatened species not as a single category,
but as a group of three categories,
depending on the degree to which they are
threatened :
● Vulnerable species : A vulnerable species
is one which has been categorised by the
International Union for Conservation of
Nature as likely to become endangered
unless the circumstances threating its
survival and reproduction improve.
● Endangered species : An endangered
species is a species which has been
categorised as indanger and is likely to
become extinct.
● Critically endangered species :
A critically endangered (CR) species is
one which has been categorised by the
International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) as facing a very high risk
of extinction in the wild. It is the highest
risk category assigned by the IUCN Red
List for wild species.
IUCN Red List
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
(also known as the IUCN Red List or Red
Data List), founded in 1964, is the world’s
most comprehensive inventory of the global
conservation status of biological species.

Climate Change
Climate change refers to long-term change
in the earth’s climate, especially a change
due to an increase in average atmospheric
temperature. In the past, Earth’s climate has
gone through warmer and cooler periods,
each lasting thousands of years.
Greenhouse Effect and Global
Warming
● The greenhouse gases (sometimes
abbreviated as GHG) in the atmosphere
absorbs and emits radiation within the
thermal infrared range. The process is the
fundamental cause of the greenhouse
effect. The primary greenhouse gases in
the Earth’s atmosphere are water vapour,
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide
and ozone. In the Solar System, the
atmosphere of Venus, Mars and Titan also
contain gases that cause greenhouse effects.
● Global Warming is the increase of Earth’s
average surface temperatue due to effect
of greenhouse gases, such as carbon
dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels
or from deforestation.
Kyoto Protocol
● The Kyoto Protocol is a protocol to the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aimed at
fighting global warming. The UNFCCC
is an international environmental
treaty with the goal of achieving the
‘‘stabilisation of greehouse gas
concentration in the atmosphere at a
level that would prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the
climate system’’. The protocol was
initially adopted on 11th December,
1997 in Kyoto, Japan and entered into
force on 16th February, 2005. Second
commitment period of this protocol
started in 2013 and will end in 2020.
● The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted
an average global rise in temperature of
1.4°C to 5.8°C between 1990 and 2100.
If successfully and completely implemented, the Kyoto Protocol will reduce
that increase by somewhere between
0.02°C and 0.28°C by the year 2050.

REDD ++
● Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest
Degradation (REDD) is an effort to
create a financial value for the
carbon stored in forests, offering
incentives to developing countries to
reduce emissions from forested lands
and invest in low carbon paths to
sustainable development.
● ‘REDD+’ goes beyond deforestation
and forest degradation and includes
the role of conservation, sustainable
management of forests and
enhancement of forest carbon
stocks.
● The proper implementation of
REDD+ will contribute to protection
of biodiversity, resilience of forest
ecosystems and poverty reduction.
Ozone Layer Depletion
● The ozone layer is located within the
Stratosphere, about 24 km above the Earth’s
surface.
● The layer consist of ozone gas molecules that
are formed as the sunlight reacts with oxygen.
● The ozone layer is very important as it
protects life on Earth by filtering the Sun’s
dangerous ultraviolet radiation.
● Due to increased pollution on Earth,
chemicals such as Chloro Fluro Carbons
(CFCs) are destroying this protective ozone
layer, which could lead to increased health
risks and damage agricultural and acquatic
ecosystem.
Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer
● It is an international treaty designed to
protect the ozone layer from Chloro Fluoro
Carbons (CFCs).
● The treaty was opened for signature on 16th
September, 1987 and entered into force on
1st January, 1989, followed by a first meeting
in Helsinki, May 1989.

Glossary
Bio Fuels are produced from dry organic
matter or combustible oils from plants such
as alcohol from fermented sugar, black
liquor from the paper manufacturing
process, wood and soyabean oil.
Biogas Gas rich in methane, which is
produced by the fermentation of animal
dung, human sewage or crop residues in an
airtight container.
Biomass Organic material, both above ground
and below ground and living and dead, such
as trees, crops, grasses and roots.
Carbon credit The concept of Carbon Credit
came into existence as a result of increasing
awareness of the need for pollution control.
Carbon credits are certificates awarded to
countries that successfully reduce the
emissions that cause global warming.
Carbon Credits are measured in units of
Certified Emission Reductions (CERs).
Each CER is equivalent to one tonne ofCO2
reduction.
Carbon Footprint The Carbon Footprint is a
measurement of all greenhouse gases in
terms of tonnes or kg of CO2
equivalent.
Carbon Market The Kyoto Protocol allows
countries that have emissions units to spare
the emissions permitted but not ‘used’ to
sell this excess capacity to countries that
are over their targets. This is called the
carbon market, because carbon dioxide is
the most widely produced greenhouse gas
and because of this other greenhouse gases
will be recorded and counted in terms of
their ‘carbon dioxide equivalents’.
Green Tax It is a tax with a potentially positive
environmental impact. It includes energy
tax, transport taxes and taxes on pollution
and resources. They are also called
environmental taxes.
Biomes Biomes are regions of the world with
similar climate (weather, temperature),
animals and plants.
Examples of Aquatic biomes are : Fresh
water, marine, Coral reef and Estuaries.
Examples of Terrestrial biomes are :
Tundra, Rainforest, Savanna, Taiga, Alpine
and Desert etc.
Environment The environment is the
biotic and abiotic surrounding of an
organism or population and includes
particularly the factor that have an
influence in their survival,
development and evolution.
Ecology It is the scientific study of the
relations that living organisms have
with respect to each other and their
natural environment.
Ecosystem An ecosystem is a biological
system consiting of all the living
organisms or biotic components in a
particular area and the non-living or
abiotic components with which the
organisms interact such as air,
mineral soil, water and sunlight.
Biosphere The biosphere is the portion
of Earth, in which all known life
forms exist. If includes a thin layer of
air (atmosphere), water
(hydrosphere) and Earth
(lithosphere).
Geosphere The atmosphere,
hydrosphere, lithosphere and
biosphere are together referred to as
the Geosphere.
Mitigation The structural and nonstructural measures undertaken to
limit the adverse impact of natural
hazards, environmental degradation
and technological hazards.
Sustainable Development
Development that meet the needs of
the present generation without
compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own
needs.
Ecological Pyramid An Ecological
Pyramid is a graphical
representation designed to show the
biomass or biomass productivity at
each Trophic level in a given
ecosystem.
Trophic Level Successive stages of
nourishment as represented by the
links of the foodchain.

● The Constitution is a set of fundamental
principles according to which state
organisation is governed. The idea to have a
Constitution was given by MN Roy.
● The objective of the Constitution is to
evolve a certain type of political culture that
is based on the values enshrined in the
Constitution and guided by the institutions
established under the Constitution.
● Certain features of Indian Polity or
Constitution can be understood better with
a brief review of the Constitutional set-up
in the preceding periods. As modern
political institutions originated and
developed in India mainly during the
British rule, the origin and growth of the
Indian Constitution has its roots in the
British period of Indian history.
The Company Rule (1773-1857)
There are certain events in the British rule
that laid down the legal framework for the
organisation and administration in British
India. These events have greatly influenced
our Constitution and polity.
They are explained below in the chronological
order
The Regulating Act, 1773
● To regulate and control the affairs of East
India Company by British Government.
● It designated the Governor of Bengal as the
‘Governor-General of Bengal’, who has the
authority over the Presidencies of Madras,
Bombay and Calcutta. The first such
Governor-General was Warren Hastings.
● A Supreme Court was established in
Calcutta. Sir Elijah Impey was the
first Chief Justice.
● It prohibited the servants of the
company to engage in any private
trade and accept presents or bribes
from natives.
Pitt’s India Act, 1784
● It provided for Board of Control having
6 members (2 from British Cabinet
and remaining from Privy Council).
● Board was set-up to guide and
supervise the affairs of the company
in India.
● Court of directors were confined to
manage the trade and commerce
related issues only.
Charter Act, 1793
● Salaries for the staff and members of
the Board of Control to be paid from
Indian revenue.
Charter Act, 1813
● Ended East India Company’s
monopoly of trade with India and
provided ` 1 lakh grant for education
in India. The Company’s monopoly in
trade with China and trade in tea were
remained intact.
Charter Act, 1833
● The centralisation of the power
began: the Governor-General of
Bengal was to be the GovernorGeneral of India. First such Governor
was Lord William Bentick.
INDIAN
CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
POLITY
● All legislative, administrative and
financial powers were handed over to
Governor-General in council. It deprived
the governor of Bombay and Madras
presidencies of their legislative powers.
● A fourth member in the GovernorGeneral’s Council was added as a law
member.
● A Law Commission under Lord
Macaulay was constituted for
codification of laws.
● The company was now no more a trading
body but had become political and
administrative body.
Charter Act, 1853
● A separate Governor for Bengal was to
be appointed.
● The Legislative and Executive functions
of the Governor-General’s Council were
separated for the first time.
● Open competition system of selection
and recruitment of Civil Servants was
introduced and the covenanted Civil
Service was open to Indian also.
● The number of members of the Court of
Directors were reduced from 24 to 18 of
which 6 were to be nominated by the
crown.
● It extended the Company’s rule and
allowed it to retain the possession of
Indian territories for the British Crown
without specifying any particular period.
● It introduced for the first time, local
representation in the Indian (Central)
Legislative Council.
THE CROWN RULE
(1857-1947)
Government of India
Act, 1858
● The power was transferred from the
company to the British Crown.
● Court of Directors and Board of Control
was abolished ending the system of
double government. The post of Secretary
of State was established. A 15 member
council was established to assist him.
Secretary of State was Member of British
Cabinet and was answerable to British
Parliament.
● The Governor-General was made the
Viceroy of India. Lord Canning became
the first Viceroy of India.
● Unitary, rigid and centralised
administrative structure was created.
Indian Councils Act, 1861
● A fifth member from legal background,
was added to the Viceroy’s Executive
Council. A Sixth member was
subsequently added in 1784. The
Viceroy could now also nominate some
Indians as non-official members in his
council. In 1862, three Indians were
nominated to the council.
● It made a beginning of representative
institutions by associating Indians with
the law making process.
● The Executive Council was now
expanded by the addition of 6 to 12
members for legislative purpose.
● Portfolio System, which was introduced
by Lord Canning in 1859, was given
recognition, so that work could be
distributed among the members. The
Viceroy was given the powers to issue
ordinances.
● Decentralisation process was started by
restoring the legislative powers to
Bombay and Madras presidencies.
Indian Councils Act, 1892
■ Though it was insignificant, but it brought an
element of representation for the first time by
allowing discussion of budget. This act also
introduced the element of election in India.
■ Although, the majority of the official
members were retained in Central legislative
Councils, the non-official members were to
be nominated by the Bengal Chamber of
Commerce and Provincial Legislative
Councils.
Indian Councils Act, 1909
(Morley Minto Reforms)
● Lord Morley, the then Secretary of State
of India and Lord Minto, the then
Viceroy of India, announced some
reforms in the British Parliament.
● The members of the Legislative Council
could ask supplementary questions,
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity 231
discuss bills, move resolutions on
financial statements and so on.
● The Legislative Councils, both at the
centre (16 to 60) and in the provinces
(not uniform) was expanded.
● It retained official majority in the
Central Legislative Council, but allowed
the Provincial Legislative Council to
have non-official majority.
● Communal representation was
introduced as Muslims were given
separate electorates based on religious
grounds.
● Satyendra Prasad Sinha became the
first Indian to join the Viceroy’s
Executive Council.
The Government of India
Act, 1919
(Montagu-Chelmsford
Reforms)
● Samuel Montagu, the Secretary of State
for India and Lord Chelmsford, Viceroy
of India prepared report to introduce
self-governing institutions in India.
● It relaxed the central control over the
provinces by separating the central and
provincial subjects.

members of Viceroy’s executive council
were to be Indian.
● Direct elections were introduced for the
first time in the country.
● The Central Legislature was to have a
Bicameral Legislature for the first time.
● Dyarchy system was introduced in the
provinces. Where provincial subjects of
administration were to be divided into

Dhar Commission
The Constituent Assembly appointed the SK Dhar Commission in June 1948, to study the

which was precarious in the background of Partition. Thus, the Dhar Commission
categorically rejected the basis of linguistic formation of states.
JVP Committee
● The Congress in its Jaipur Session in 1948, appointed a three member committee to
consider the recommendation of the Dhar Commission. Its members were Jawaharlal
Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Pattabhi Sitaramayya.

CITIZENSHIP
● Rights are claims of social life and
they help individuals to develop their
personality. Some of the Fundamental
Rights provide protection only against
the state action and do not safeguard
against the action of private
individuals.
● The Fundamental Rights are guaranteed and protected by the
Constitution to all persons without
any discrimination.
● The Fundamental Rights have been
described in Articles 12-35, Part III
of Indian Constitution.
● Originally, Fundamental Rights were
seven in number viz
¡ Right to Equality.
¡ Right to Freedom.
¡ Right against Exploitation.
¡ Right to Freedom of Religion.
¡ Cultural and Educational Rights.
¡ Right to Property.
¡ Right to Constitutional Remedies.
Right to Property
The Right to Property (Article 31) was
deleted from the list of Fundamental
Rights by the 44th Amendment Act, 1978.
It is made a legal right under Article-300A
in Part XII of the Constitution.
Right to Equality
(Article 14-18)
Article 14 Equality before law and
equal protection of laws. It says that the
state shall not deny to any person
equality before the law or equal
protection of the laws within the
territory of India. This provision
confers rights to all persons whether
citizens or foreigners. The concept of
equality before law is an element of the
concept of ‘Rule of law’- propounded by AV
Dicey, the British Jurist.
The rule of equality before law is not absolute.
Some of the exceptions are
¡ The President or the Governor is not
answerable to any court for the exercise and
performance of the powers and duties of his
office.
¡ No criminal proceedings shall be instituted
or continued against the President or the
Governor in any court during his term of

notice delivered to him.
Article 15 Prohibition of discrimination on
certain grounds. It says that the state shall not
discriminate against any citizen on grounds of
religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. This
provision prohibits discrimination both by state
and private individuals.
There are three exceptions to this general rule
of non-discriminations

children.

and economically backward classes of
citizens.
● Special provisions for any socially,
educationally and economically backward

Right (Article 31).
● The right under Article 30 also includes
the right of a minority to impart

language.
Right to Constitutional
Remedies (Article 32)
● Dr BR Ambedkar said, Article 32 is the
heart and soul of the Constitution.
● Supreme Court ruled that Article 32 is a
basic feature of the Constitution.
Hence, it cannot be abridged or taken
away even by way of an amendment to
the Constitution. Under Article 32,
Supreme Court and Article 226, High
Court can issue writs of various forms in
case of violation of Fundamental Rights:
● Habeas Corpus It is a Latin term which
literally means, ‘to have the body of,’. It is
an order issued by the court to a person
who has detained another person, to
produce the body of the latter before it.
The court then examines the cause and
legality of detention. It would set the
detained person free, if the detention is
found to be illegal. This writ may be
addressed to an official or a private
person, who has another person in his
custody.
● Mandamus It literally means ‘we
command’. It is a command issued by
the court to a public official asking him
to perform his official duties that he has
failed or refused to perform. It can also
be issued against any public body, a
corporation, an inferior court, a tribunal
or government for the same purpose.
● Quo-warranto In the literal sense, it
means ‘‘by what authority or warrant’’. It
is issued to enquire into the legality of
claim of a person to a public office.
Hence, it prevents illegal usurpation of
public office by a person. The writ can be
issued only in case of a substantive
public office of a permanent character
244 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity
created by a statute or by the Constitution. It cannot be issued in cases of ministerial
office or private office.
● Prohibition Literally means ‘to forbid’. It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or
tribunal to prevent the latter from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a jurisdiction
that, it does not possess.
Thus, unlike mandamus that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity. The writ
of prohibition can be issued only against judicial and Quasi- Judicial authorities. It is
not available against Administrative Authorities, Legislative Bodies and private
individuals or bodies.
● Certiorari In the literal sense, it means, ’to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’. It is issued
by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a case pending with the
latter to itself or to squash the order of the latter in a case. It is issued on the grounds of
excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or error of law. Thus, unlike prohibition,
which is only preventive, certiorari is both preventive as well as curative.
Limitations on the Enforcement of Fundamental Rights
● Parliament has the power to modify the application of the Fundamental Rights to the
members of the Armed Forces, Police Forces or Intelligence Organisations so as to
ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline among them
(Article 33).
● Certain Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution may remain suspended,
while a Proclamation of Emergency is made by the President under Article 352.
● Article 34 Restriction on Rights conferred by this Part while martial law is in force in
any area.
● Article 35 Legislation, to give effect to the provisions of this part.

similar to those of Speaker of Lok Sabha.
Deputy Chairman
● Elected by Rajya Sabha itself from
amongst its members. Deputy Chairman
is not subordinate to the Chairman. He is
directly responsible to the Rajya Sabha.
Joint Session (Article 108)
● Joint sessions take place on the order of
the President if
(a) a Bill passed by one House, is rejected
by another.
(b) the amendments made by the other
House are not acceptable to the House
where the Bill originated.
(c) Other house do not take any action for
six months on the bill.
● Joint session is presided over by the
Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The deadlock
over a Bill is resolved by a majority of the
total numbers of the members of both the
Houses present and voting.
● So far, joint-sittings have been held thrice
in the history of Indian Parliament (1961,
1978 and 2002).
● Provision of joint sitting is applicable to
ordinary bills or financial bills only and
not to money bills or constitutional
amendment bills.
Sessions of Parliament
● The Parliament generally meets in
three sessions in a year i.e.,
Budget session (February-May) (longest
session), Monsoon session (JulySeptember), Winter session
(November- December) (shortest
session).
● There should not be a gap of more than
6 months between two sessions of
Parliament.
Difference between Powers of Lok
Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
● A Money Bill can be introduced only in
the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya
Sabha. The final power to decide
whether a particular bill is a Money Bill
or not, is vested in the Speaker of the
Lok Sabha. The Speaker of Lok Sabha
presides over the joint sitting of both the
Houses of Parliament.
● A resolution for the discontinuance of
the National Emergency can be passed
only by the Lok Sabha and not by the
Rajya Sabha.
● The Rajya Sabha cannot remove the
Council of Ministers by passing a
no-confidence motion.
● This is because the Council of Ministers
is collectively responsible only to the
Lok Sabha. But, the Rajya Sabha can
discuss and criticise the policies and
activities of the government.

LEGISLATIVE
PROCEDURE
IN PARLIAMENT
● The legislative procedure is identical in
both the Houses of Parliament. Every bill
has to pass through the same stages in
each House. A Bill is a proposal for
legislation and it becomes an Act or law
when duly enacted.
● Bills may be classified under four heads
viz, Ordinary, Money, Financial and
Constitutional Amendment Bills. The
Legislative procedure of government bills
and private members bill is same.
● Money Bills cannot be introduced in the
Rajya Sabha. The other bills can be
introduced in either House.
● Every ordinary bill has to pass through
five stages in the Parliament i.e. first
Reading, second Reading, third Reading,
Bill in the second House and Assent of
the President. Finally, the Bill has to be
notified by the Government to enable its
implementation.
Stages of Bills
The different stages in the passage of Bills
other than the Money Bills are as follows
Introduction of the Bill
● It involves introduction of Bill like
provisions of the proposed law,
accompanied by the ‘Statement of
Objects and Reasons’. Private member
must give one month notice to introduce
the Bill.
● After that it is published in the Gazette of
India. The introduction of the Bill and its
publication in the Gazette constitutes the
First Reading of the Bill.
Special Powers of Rajya Sabha
Due to its federal character, the Rajya Sabha
has been given two exclusive or special powers
that are not enjoyed by the Lok Sabha.
■
It can authorise the Parliament to make a law
on a subject enumerated in the State List
(Article 249).
■
It can authorise the Parliament to create new
All-India Services Common for both the centre
and states (Article 312).
Second Reading of the Bill
● In the second reading principles of the
Bill are discussed in details and the
treasury and the opposition members
give their views either in support or
opposition of the Bill.
● The second reading is divided into two
stages, (i) consists of a general
discussion of the principles of the Bill
and (ii) relates to discussion of clauses,
schedules and amendments.
● If the Bill is referred to the Selected
Committee or Joint Committee, it is
expected to give its report within a
specified date.
● The Bill then undergoes long
discussions clause by clause and may
undergo substantial change.
Third Reading of the Bill
● The third reading is the final reading. It
is more or less a formal affair. The
debate is confined to the acceptance or
rejection of the Bill. The Bill is
submitted to the vote of the House and
has to be accepted or rejected
altogether.
Bill in the Second House
● After the Bill has been passed by one
House, it is transmitted to the other
House, where it has to pass through the
same process. The other House has four
alternatives before it.
1. It may pass the Bill as sent by the first
House.
2. It may pass the Bill with amendments
and return it to the first House.
3. It may reject the Bill altogether.
4. It may not take any action and thus
keep the Bill pending.
● In case the Bill is also passed by the
second House or the first House agrees
with the amendmendments made by the
second house, the Bill is sent to the
President for his assent.
● In case the Bill is rejected by the second
House or it is kept by the second House
with it for six months without any action
or the first House disagrees with the
amendments suggested by the second
House, a deadlock is deemed to have
taken place.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity 261
● To resolve a deadlock, the President may
summon a joint-sitting of the two Houses
under Article 108. If the majority of members
present and voting at the joint-sitting pass the
Bill, it is considered as passed by both Houses
of Parliament and is sent for President’s assent.
Assent of the President
● After being passed by both Houses (either
Singles or at Joint Sitting), when the Bill is
presented to the President, he has three
options
1. He may assent to the Bill
2. He may withhold his assent
3. He may return the Bill for the
reconsideration of the Houses.
● If the President gives assents to the Bill, it
becomes an Act.
● If the President withholds his assent, the Bill
ends.
● If the President returns the Bill for
reconsideration and it is passed again by both
the Houses, he has to give his assent after the
second passage.
● Since, the Constitution provides no time limit
for the President to give his assent, he may
keep the Bill in his office without taking any
action and prevent it from becoming an act.
Consolidated Fund
of India (Article 266)
● It is a fund to which all receipts are
credited and all payments are
debited. In other words,
¡ all revenues received by the
Government of India.
¡ all loans raised by the government
by the issue of treasury bills, loans
or ways and means of advances.
¡ all money received by the government in repayment of loans from
the Consolidated Fund of India.
● All the legally authorised payments
on behalf of the government are
made out of this fund. No money
out of this fund can be appropriated
(issued or drawn) except in
accordance with a Parliamentary law.
Contingency Fund of India
(Article 267)
● Article 267 of the Constitution
authorised the Parliament to
establish a ‘Contingency Fund of
India’, into which amounts
determined by law are paid from time
to time. Accordingly, the Parliament
enacted the Contingency Fund of
India Act in 1950.
● This fund is placed at the disposal
of the President and he can make
advances out of it to meet
unforeseen expenditure pending its
authorisation by the Parliament.
● The fund is held by the finance
secretary on behalf of President.
Public Account of India
● Article 266 (2) provides that all
other public moneys (other than
those in the Consolidated Fund of
India) received by or on behalf of
the Government of India or the
Government of a State shall be
credited to the Public Account of
India or the Public Account of the
State, as the case may be. This
account is operated by executive
action and payments from it do not
need Parliamentary approval.
● Moneys in this account include
provident fund deposits, savings
bank deposits, remittances etc.
262 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity
Budget in Parliament
■ The Constitution refers to the budget as the

receipts and expenditure of the Government of
India in a financial year, which begins on 1st April
and ends on 31st March of the following year.
■ After introduction of the Budget, the Lok Sabha
discusses the demands for grants of various
ministries and departments. All grants voted by the
Lok Sabha and expenditure, charged on the
consolidated fund of India, are then presented in
the form of single Bill called the ‘Appropriation
Bill’. Proposals for taxation (to raise revenue) are
presented in the form of ‘Finance Bill’.

the Railway Budget and the General Budget.
■ From 2017, Railway Budget has been merged with
the General Budget on the recommendation of

Amendment Act of 1956, authorised the Parliament to establish a common High Court
for two or more states or a state and a union territory.
● The territorial jurisdiction of a High Court is co-terminus with the territory of a state.
● As of 2019, there are 25 High Courts in India. Telangana is the 25th High Court.

Union-State Relations
The federal system adopted in India
involves division of authority between the
union and the states. Relations between
the union and states can be studied under
the following parts.
A. Legislative Relations (Art.
245-255)
● The Constitution divides the subjects
into the Union List (100 subjects), the
State List (61 subjects) and the
Concurrent List (52 subjects).
Enumerated in the Seventh Schedule
under Article 246. Parliament has
exclusive power to legislate on subjects
mentioned in the Union List. This list
contains subjects like defence, foreign
affairs, atomic energy etc.
● State Legislatures have exclusive power
to legislate on subjects mentioned in the
State List. The State List contains
subjects like health, sanitation, public
order, agriculture etc. Both Parliament
and State Legislatures can legislate on
subjects mentioned in the Concurrent
List. This list contains subjects like
criminal law, forests, education,
marriage and divorce etc.
● Residual Powers (i.e. subjects not
included in any of the list) rest with
Union Government.
Lok Adalat
■ Lok Adalat (People’s Courts), established by the
government, settles disputes through
conciliation and compromise. The first Lok
Adalat was held in Gujrat on 14th March, 1982.
■ The Lok Adalat is presided over by a sitting or
retired judicial officer as Chairman, with two
other member, usually a lawyer and a social
worker. There is no court fee. If the case is
already filed in a regular court, the fee paid is
refunded if the dispute is settled at the Lok
Adalat.
■ Lok Adalat is very effective in settlement of
money claims. Disputes, like partition suits,
damages and matrimonial cases, can also be
easily settled in Lok Adalat, as chances of
compromise through give and take approach
stand high in such cases.
■ Lok Adalat is a boon to the litigant public,
where they can get their disputes settled fast
and free of cost.
■ Lok Adalats have been given the status of a
Civil Court and every award made by the Lok
Adalat is final and binding on all parties and no
appeals lies to any court against its award.
B. Administrative Relations
(Art. 256-263)

Laws of the Parliament and not impede the
exercise of the Executive Powers of the
Union (Articles 256, 257). In this regard, the
Union Government can issue necessary
directives to the states. All disputes between
states regarding the use, distribution or
control of water are decided by the centre
(Article 262).
C. Financial Relations (Art. 268-293)
● The states are greatly dependent on the
Central Government for finance. The State
Governments have been provided
independent sources of revenue, but these
are inadequate.

borrow from within India or outside,
subject to the limits laid down by the
Parliament, the borrowing power of the
states is subject to several limitations and

INTRODUCTION OF ECONOMICS
INDIAN
ECONOMY
The term economics comes from the ancient
Greek word oikonomia mean management of
a household. Economic is the social science
that studies economic activities to gain
an understanding of the processes that
govern the production, distribution and
consumption of goods and services in an
economy.
Economics includes the study of labour, land
and investments of capital, income and
production and taxes and government
expenditures. Adam Smith, regarded as the
Father of Economics, defines Economics as,
‘‘The science relating to the laws of
production, distribution and exchange.’’
Branches of Economics
The two chief branches are as follow:
Micro Economics
● It is concerned with how supply and
demand interact in individual market and
how these interactions determine the
price level of goods and services.
● It examine the economic behaviour of
individual actor/agent at the level of the
economic entity–the individual firm, the
individual consumer and the individual
worker.
It examine the behaviour of basic elements in
the economy, including individual agents
(such as households and firms or as buyers
and sellers) and market and their interaction.
Macro Economics
It studies the economy as a whole and its
features like national income, unemployment,
poverty, balance of payments and inflation.
It deals with formulation of models
explaining relationship between factors
such as consumption, inflation, savings,
investment, national income and
finance.
ECONOMY
It represents production, distribution or
trade and consumption of goods and
services in a given geographical area by
different agents, which can be
individuals, businesses, organisation or
governments.
The study of economy of any country
helps us to find out the financial
condition of the population as well as the
different working sectors of the economy.
The modern economy is a complex
machine. Its job is to allocate limited
resources and distribute output among a
large number of agents mainly
individuals, firms and governments
allowing for the possibility that each
agent’s action can directly (or indirectly)
affect other agent’s actions. There are
two major type of economies.
Open Economy
An economy said to be open, if it has trade
with other economies. In this economy,
market is mostly free from trade barriers
and where exports and imports from a
large percentage of the GDP.
Degree of openness of an economy
determines a government’s freedom to
pursue economic policies of its choice
and the susceptibility of the country to
the international economic cycles.
Closed Economy
An economy in which no activity is
conducted with outside economies. In
simple language, no imports are brought in
and no exports are sent out in closed
economy.
The goal of such economy is to provide
consumers with everything that they need
from within the economy’s borders and
government act as the arbitrator, articulator
and facilitator.
In India, since independence, the
government has played a major role in
planning economic activities.
Present Status of Indian Economy
■
Indian economy is world’s 5th largest economy
(as per December, 2019) or nominal GDP basis
and the 3rd largest by Purchasing Power Party
(PPP) in 2019.
■ According to CSO-The growth in GDP during
2017-18 is estimated at 6.5% as compared to
the growth rate of 7.1% in 2016-17.
■ During each of the previous two year, 2014-15
and 2015-16, India’s Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) (Base year 2011-12) grew by 7.2% and
7.6% respectively per annum.
■ From 1951 until 2013, India GDP Annual
Growth rate averaged 5.8% reaching an all
time high of 10.2% in December of 1988 and a
record low of 5.2% in December of 1979.
■ On a per capita income basis, India ranked
141th by nominal GDP and 126th by GDP (PPP)
in 2017, according to the IMF.
■ Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory,
which states that exchanges rates between
currencies are balanced, when their purchasing
power is the same in each of the two countries.
Broad Sectors of Indian
Economy
Primary Sector
The primary sector include production of
raw material and includes agriculture,
forestry, fishing, mining and quarrying .
Secondary Sector
The secondary sector of economy is involved
in the production of finished goods. Mining
manufacturing, electricity, gas and water
supply, construction (also called
manufacturing sector).
Tertiary Sector
These sector provides services to the
general population and business.
Business, transport, telecommunication,
banking, insurance, real estate,
community and personnel services (also
called service sector).
Nature of Indian Economy
● Mixed Economy It is an economy,
where both public and private sector
co-exist. The nature of Indian economy
is a mixed economy. The term Mixed
economy was coined by JM Keynes.
Mixed economy are often under
government regulation.
● Developing Economy Following
features shows that Indian economy is a
developing economy
(a) Low per capita income.
(b) Occupational pattern is primary
sector dominated.
(c) Heavy population pressure.
(d) Prevalence of chronic
unemployment and
underemployment.
(e) Steadily improving rate of capital
formation.
(f) Low capital per head.
(g) Unequal distribution of wealth/
assets.
● Agrarian Economy An agrarian
economy is a type of economy that
relies primarily on agricultural industry
including livestock farming or corp
production. It is form of economy
whose major factor of production in the
agricultural land.
NATIONAL INCOME
OF INDIA
● National Income (NI) is the net value
of all the final goods and services
produced by its nationals during a
financial year. It is a flow concept. In
India, the financial year is from
1st April to 31st March. The national
income is calculated annually.
● According to National Income
Committee (1949). “A national income
estimate measures the volume of
commodities and service turned out
290 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy
during a given period counted without
duplication”.
● NI = C + G + I + (X −M) + (R − P)
− Depreciation − Indirect tax +
Subsidies.
C = Total Consumption Expenditure
I = Total Investment Expenditure
G = Total Government Expenditure
X = Export
M = Import
(R-P)= Net Faction Income from abroad.
● When the National Income is measured
at the base year price, it is called
national income at constant price.
● When the national income is measured
at the current year price, it is called
national income at current year price.
● When NNP is calculated at Factor Cost
(FC) it is called National Income. This
measure is calculated by deducting
indirect taxes and adding subsidies in
NNP at Market Price (MP).
● NNPFC= NNPMP – Indirect
Taxes + Subsidies + Government
surplus = National Income.
● NI = NNP + Subsidies − Indirect taxes
● GNP − Depreciation − Indirect taxes +
Subsidies.
● The CSO released the ‘New series’ of
national accounts with base year 2011-12
instead of the base year 2004-05. The
revisions happen every 5 years.
● In India, Central Statistical Organisation
(1949) renamed as Central Statistical
Office (CSO) has been formulating
National Income.
■ National Income is the measurement of
the production power of an economic system
in a given time period.
■ National Wealth is the measurement of
the present assets available at a given time.
Methods of Measuring
National Income
Product Method
In this method, net value of final goods and
services produced in a country during a
year is obtained, which is called total final
product. This represents Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). Net income earned in
foreign boundaries by nationals is added
and depreciation is subtracted from GDP.
Income Method
In this method, a total of net income earned
by working people in different sectors and
commercial enterprises is obtained.
Incomes of both categories of people —
paying taxes and not paying taxes are added
to obtain national income. By income
method, national income is obtained by
adding receipts as total rent, total wages,
total interest and total profit.
Consumption Method
It is also called expenditure method. Income
is either spent on consumption or saved.
Hence, national income is the addition of
total consumption and total savings.
In India, a combination of production
method and income method is used for
estimating national income.
Estimates of National
Income in India
● In 1868, the first attempt was made by
Dadabhai Naoroji in his book ‘Poverty
and Un-British Rule in India’. He
estimated the per capita annual income
to be ` 20.
● The first scientific attempt to measure
national income in India was made by
professor VKRV Rao in 1931-32. He
divided the Indian economy into
13 sectors.
● In 1949, National Income Committee
under the Chairmanship of professor PC
Mahalanobis was constituted. The other
members were professor VKRV Rao and
professor DR Gadgil.
● The Government of India appointed a
National Income Committee under the
Chairmanship of Dr PC Mahalanobis.
This committee gave its first report in
1951 and final report New Series in 1954.
NATIONAL INCOME
AGGREGATES
Gross Domestic Product
(GDP)
It is the total money value of all final goods
and services produced within the
geographical boundaries of the country
during a given period of time.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 291
GDP = C + G + I
Where, C= Consumption expenditure
G = Government expenditure
I = Investment expenditure
But in closed economy, (R - P) = 0, then GDP = GNP where, (R - P) = Net factor income
from abroad.
GDP At Market Price
(GDP MP)
● It refers to the total value of all the goods and services at market price produced during
a year within the geographical boundaries of the country.
● Market price refers to the actual transacted price and it includes indirect taxes such as
Excise Duty, VAT, Service Tax, Customs Duty etc but it excludes government subsidies.
GDP at Factor Cost (GDPFC)
● GDP can be calculated at factor cost. This measure more accurately reveals the
income paid to factors of production.
● The factor cost means the total cost of all factors of production consumed or used in
producing a good or service. It includes government grants and subsidies, but it
excludes Indirect Taxes.
● The difference between Market Price (MP) and Cost Price (CP) is because of the
Indirect Taxes and Subsidies.
● GDPFC = GDP MP − Indirect Taxes + Subsidies
● In terms of value addition, the Gross Domestic Product of the economy is the sum total
of the net value added and depreciation of all the firms of the economy.
Calculation of GDP
● GDP in a country is usually calculated by the National Statistical Agency, which
compiles the information from a large number of sources.
● In case of India, it is Central Statistics Office (CSO), which estimates GDP. However,
most countries follow established international standards for calculating GDP of their
country.
● The international standards for measuring GDP are contained in the System of
National Accounts (SNA), 1993, compiled by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the European Commission (EC), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank.
Source Central Statistics Office
PE = Provisional Estimates (CSO)
Nominal GDP and Real GDP
Nominal GDP is evaluated at current market prices. Therefore, nominal GDP will
include all of the changes in market prices that have occurred during the current year
due to inflation or deflation.
Real GDP is a better measurement of GDP, since it reflects the increase in quantity of
goods and services by adjusting for any increase in prices. Real GDP is generally
measured by using base year prices of goods and services.
Gross Value Added (GVA)
● It is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or
sector of an economy. It national accounts, GVA is output minus intermediate
consumption, it is a balancing item of the national accounts’ production account.
● RBI dumps GVA model in August, 2018 and switches back to GDP to measure
economy.
292 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy
Gross National Product (GNP)
GNP refers to the money value of total
output of production of final goods and
services produced by the national
residents of a country during a given
period of time, generally a year.
Symbolically
GNP = GDP + (X − M) + (R − P)
GNP = C + G + I + (X − M) + (R − P)
X = Exports
M = Imports
(R−P) = Net factor income from abroad
Net National Product (NNP)
It is obtained by subtracting depreciation
value (i.e. capital stock consumption)
from GNP.
Symbolically,
NNP = GNP − Depreciation
National Income = NNP −Indirect taxes
+ Subsidies.
Personal Income (PI)
It is that income, which is actually
obtained by the individual or nationals.
Symbolically,
Personal Income = National Income +
Transfer Payments − Social Security
Contributions − Corportate Tax −
Undistributed Profits.
Personal Disposable
Income (PDI)
When personal direct taxes are
subtracted from personal income, the
obtained value is called personal
disposable income.
Symbolically,
PDI = PI − Direct taxes
National Statistical Organisation (NSO)
was set-up on 1st June, 2005, for
promoting statistical network in the
country. It was then headed by professor
SD Tendulkar. Gross Value Added (GVA)
is a measure in economics of the value of
goods and services produced in an area,
industry or sector of an economy.
GVA = GDP + Subsidies − (direct, sales)
taxes.
CSO and NSSO
■ CSO (Central Statistical Organisation) was
set-up in 1950, constituted to publish national
income data.
■ NSSO (National Sample Survey Organisation)
was set-up in 1950, for conducting large scale
sample survey to meet the data needs of the
country for the estimation of national income
and other aggregates.
■
In May 2019, Ministry of Statistics and
Programme Implementation has merged the
both CSO and NSSO in a single body named as
National Statistical Office.
Measurement of Growth
and Development
Human Development Report
The Human Development Report (HDR),
published by the UNDP since 1990, captures
the essence of human development. Human
development report rank countries based on
their ranking on Human Development Index
(HDI). HDI was devised by Pakistani
economist Mahbub ul Haq along with Indian
economist Amartya Sen.
In 2019 HDR, India has been placed at 129th
position with 0.647 score in medium human
development category. Norway, Switzerland
and Ireland occupies first three positions.
Meaning of HDI Value
Very high Human
development

High Human
development
= 0.700 and above
Medium Human
development
= 0.550 and above
Low Human
development
= 0.352 and above
Happy Planet Index (HPI)
HPI measures the ecological efficiency with
which human well-being is delivered. It is
calculated by multiplying indices of life
satisfaction (estimated by compiling
responses to international surveys) and life
expectancy and dividing that product by
ecological footprint.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 293
Gross National Happiness (GNH)
The term Gross National Happiness was coined in 1972, by Bhutan’s then King Jigme
Singye Wangchuck.
GNH was designed in on attempt to define an indicator that measures quality of life or
social progress in more holistic and psychological terms than the economic indicator
of GDP.
NITI AAYOG
NITI Aayog or National Institution for Transforming India Aayog came into existence on
1st January, 2015. It is policy-making think-tank of government that replaces Planning

Planning Commission
■ Planning commission was formed on 15th
March, 1950, under the Chairmanship of Pt.
Jawaharlal Nehru. It was to formulate plans
for the economic development of the country
on the basis of the available physical,
capital and human resources.
■ Planning commission was dissolved on
17th August, 2014.
■ On 1st January, 2015, Government of India
established NITI Aayog (National Institution
for Transforming India) to replace planning
commission.
National Development
Council (NDC)
NDC is neither a constitutional body nor
statutory body. The NDC was constituted on
6th August, 1952, with Prime Minister as
the Ex-officio Chairman and the Secretary of
the Planning Commission as the Ex-officio
Secretary of the NDC. Chief Minister of all
the states and the members of the Planning
Commission, Lieutenant Governors and
Administrator of Union Territories are the
members of the NDC.
STRATEGIES
OF PLANNING
Harrod-Domar Strategy
● First Five Year Plan was based on this
strategy.
● This strategy emphasised the role of
capital accumulation’s dual character,
which on the one hand increases the
national income (demand side role) and
on the other hand increases the
production capacity (supply side role).
Nehru-Mahalanobis Strategy
● Second Five Year Plan was based on this
strategy.
● Based on Russian experience, this strategy
is a two sector model, i.e. consumer good
sector and capital good sector.
● The strategy emphasised investment in
heavy industry to achieve industrialisation
for rapid economic development.
Gandhian Strategy
● It was enunciated by Acharya SN Agarwal
in his ‘Gandhian Plan’ in 1944. The basic
objective of the Gandhian Model is to
raise the material as well as cultural level
of the masses so as to provide basic
standard of life.
LPG Strategy
● Liberalisation, Privatisation and
Globalisation (LPG) strategy of planning
was introduced by the Finance Minister
of that time, Dr Manmohan Singh under
Narsimha Rao Government. The strategy
ended the ‘license permit raj’ and opened
the hitherto areas reserved for the public
sector to private sector.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 295
PURA Strategy
● PURA stands for providing Urban amenities in rural areas and was the brainchild of
APJ Abdul Kalam.
● This strategy emphasises on three connectivities—physical, electronic, knowledge and

Five Year Plans (At a Glance)
Plan Objectives Assessment
First Plan
(1951-56)
(Harrod
Domar
Model)
n Highest priority accorded to
agriculture in view of large import of
foodgrains and inflation.
n 31 % of total plan outlay on
agriculture followed by transport and
communication, social services,
power and industry.
n Economist KN Raj was the architect.
n Agriculture production increased
dramatically.
n National income went up by 18% and
per capita income by 11%.
n Target growth 2.1% and achieved
3.6%.
Second
Plan
(1956-61)
n Rapid industrialisation with particular
emphasis on the development of
basic and heavy industry, also called
Nehru Mahalanobis Plan.
n To increase national income by 25%,
expansion of employment and
reduction of inequality.

Rourkela (W Germany) steel plants
set-up with foreign help. Atomic
Energy Commission came into being
in operation and TIFR was set-up.
n Inflation and low agricultural
production and Suez crisis.
Third Plan
(1961-66)
(Gadgil
Yojana)
n Indian economy entered take off
stage (WW Rostow). Self-reliant and
self-generaling economy was the
goal.

growth 2.72%.
n The situation created by Indo-Pakistan
Conflict (1965), two successive years
of severe drought, devaluation of
currency by 57%, general rise in

plan delayed.
Annual
Plans
n Due to the unfortunate failure of the third plan, the production in various sectors
of the economy became stagnant. In 1966, the Government of India declared
the devaluation of rupee, with a view to increase the exports of the country. So,
the fourth plan was postponed and three annual plan were implemented. Some
of the economists called this period i.e. from 1966 to 1969 as Plan Holiday.
Fourth
Plan
(1969-74)
n Laid special emphasis on improving
the condition of under privileged and
weaker sections.
n First two years of the plan were
successful with record foodgrain
production on account of Green
Revolution.
n Targeted growth 5.7% however,
achieved growth 3.3%.
n The plan was failure on account of run
way inflation (due to 1972 oil crisis or
supply shock) huge influx of refugees
from Bangladesh post 1972 Indo-Pak
War.

n Fifth Plan terminated one year before
the plan period in March 1978.
n Brought to the core problem
associated with coalition government
making a mockery of formulation of
Five Year Plan.
Plan Objectives
Annual Plan n Annual Plan (Gunar Myrdal) was brought out by Janata Party Government
under Morarji Desai in 1978. The focus of the plan was enlargement of the
employment potential in agriculture and allied activities to raise the income of
the lowest income classes through minimum needs programme. Annual Plan
period was 1979-80.
Sixth Plan
(1980-85)
n Removal of poverty through
strengthening of infrastructure for
both agriculture and industry.The
emphasis was laid on greater
management, efficiency and
monitoring of various schemes.
n Involvement of people in formulating
schemes of development at local
level.

progress and most of the targets
fixed by the plan was achieved.
n Targeted growth 5.2% and achieved
growth 5.4%.
Seventh
Plan
(1985-90)

n Foodgrain production grew by
3.23% as compared to a long-term
growth rate of 2.68% between
1967-68 and 1988-89.The Indian
economy finally crossed the barrier
of the Hindu rate of growth
(professor Raj Krishna).
n Average annual growth rate was
6.0% as against the targeted 5.0%
and average of 3.5% in the previous
plans.
Annual Plan n The Eighth Plan could not take off due to fast changing political situations at
the centre. Therefore, from 1990-1992, Annual Plans were formulated.
Eighth Plan
(1992-97)
n Process of fiscal reforms and
economic reforms initiated by
Narsimhan Rao Government to
prevent another major economic
crisis.

● Poverty is a social phenomenon where few
section of society is unable to fulfil even basic
necessities of life.
● Planning Commission (Now, NITI Aayog) is
the authority, which publishes the poverty
estimates based on various rounds of National
Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) on
monthly per capita consumption expenditure.
In India, traditionally the poverty line was
defined on the basis of calorie intake.
According to this, 2100 calories a day has
been fixed for urban areas and 2400 calories
in rural areas.
● However, this methodology was changed
considering other requirements of the poors
such as housing, clothing and education etc.
The current estimation of poverty are based
upon the recommendation of Suresh
Tendulkar Committee (2005) that
recommended to shift away from the calorie
based model.
● It stipulated a benchmark daily per capita
expenditure of ` 27 and ` 33 in rural and urban
areas respectively to arrive at a poverty line.
Causes of Rural Poverty
● Rapid Population growth
● Lack of capital
● Lack of alternate employment
opportunities other than
agriculture
● Excessive population pressure on
agriculture
● Illiteracy
● Regional disparities
● Joint family system
● Child marriage
● Lack of proper implementation of
PDS (Public Distribution System)
Causes of Urban Poverty
● Migration from rural areas
● Lack of skilled labour
● Lack of housing facilities
● Limited job opportunities in cities
● Lack of vocational education/
training

New Definition of Slums
■ As per the Pranab Sen Committee’s
new methodology, there has been increase in
the urban slum population in 2011 to
93.06 million from 75.26 million estimated in
2001. This is an increase of 26.31%.
■ As per the new definition, any compact
housing cluster or settlement of atleast
20 households with a collection of poorly
built tenements, which are mostly,
temporary in nature with inadequate
sanitary, drinking water facilities and
unhygienic conditions will be termed as
slums.
Poverty and its Study
in India
Various economists and organisations have
studied the extent of poverty in India. Some
of them are as follows:
Dandekar and Rath’s Study of
Poverty in India
Dr VM Dandekar and Mr Nilkantha Rath
estimated the value of the diet with 2250
calories as the desired minimum level of
nutrition.
They estimated that in 1968-69 about 40%
of the rural population and a little more
than 50% of the urban population lived
below the poverty line.
Montek Singh Ahluwalia’s Study
of Rural Poverty (1977)
MS Ahluwalia studied the trends in
incidence of rural poverty in India for the
period 1956-57 to 1973-74. He used the
concept of poverty line, i.e. an expenditure
level of ` 15 in 1960-61 for rural areas and
` 20 per person for urban areas.
Estimate of Poverty by the
Seventh Finance Commission
(1978)
The Seventh Finance Commission made
an attempt to have a more inclusive
concept of poverty line.
Since, the NSS data cover only household
consumer expenditure, thus, to get a more
inclusive measure of welfare or
deprivation, an estimate of the benefit of
public expenditure was added to private
consumer expenditure norm for
calculating the augmented poverty line.
Tendulkar Committee
Report
This committee moved away from just
calorie criterion definition to a broader
definition of poverty that also includes
expenditure on health, education, clothing
in addition to food. According to this report,
41.8% population in rural areas and 25.7%
population in urban areas was living below
poverty line.
Rangarajan Report on
Poverty
The expert group under the Chairmanship
of Dr C Rangarajan to review the
Methodology for measurement of poverty
in the country constituted by the Planning
Commission in June, 2012 has submitted
its report on 30th June, 2014. The report
retained consumption expenditure
estimates of NSSO as the basis for
determining poverty. On the basis of this, it
pegged the total number of poor in India at
363 million or 29.6% of the population.
This is higher than 269.8 million poor
people or 21.9% pegged by the Suresh
Tendulkar Committee.
Highlights of the Report
The highlights of the report are as follows:
(i) The daily per capita expenditure is
pegged at ` 32 for the rural poor and at
` 47 for the urban poor.
(ii) Poverty line based on the average
monthly per capita expenditure is
pegged at ` 972 for rural areas and
` 1407 for urban areas.
(iii) The percentage of people below the
poverty line in 2011-12 was 30.95 in
rural areas and 26.4 in urban areas.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 303
Unemployment
Unemployment in India
Unemployment refers to a situation,
when a person is able and willing to work
at the prevailing wage rate, but doesn’t get
the opportunity to work. Unemployment
is often used as a measure of the health of
the economy. The most frequently cited
measure of unemployment is
unemployment rate. That is the number
of unemployed persons divided by the
number of people in the labour force.
Estimation of
Unemployment
● B Bhagwati Committee on unemployment estimates (1973) set-up by the
Planning Commission gave three
estimates of unemployment.
These are as follows:
■ Usual Principal Status (UPS)
Persons who remained unemployed
for a major part of the year. This is
also called ‘open unemployment’.
■ Current Weekly Status (CWS)
A person is considered to be
employed if he or she pursues any
one or more of the gainful activities
for at least one hour on any day of
the reference week.
■ Current Daily Status (CDS)
Persons who did not find work on a
day or some days during the
survey week. This is the
comprehensive measure of
unemployment, including chronic as
well as underemployment.
TYPES OF
UNEMPLOYMENT
Generally, unemployment can be
classified into two types
Voluntary Unemployment
This type of unemployment is on account
of people not interested to take the
employment i.e. jobs are available but the
persons are not interested in being
employed.
It is psychological in nature. Therefore, such
types of persons are not included in the
category of unemployed.
Involuntary Unemployment
It refers to a situation in which the persons
are interested to work but the jobs are not
available. Such persons are included in the
categories of unemployed persons. It is also
called open employment.
Cyclical Unemployment
This type of unemployment is due to the
recession in the economy. During recession,
there is less requirement of man-power on
account of the decrease in the level of
economic activities and thus causes cyclical
unemployment. This type of unemployment
is prevalent in the developed countries. This
is also known as Keynesian Unemployment.
Frictional Unemployment
This type of unemployment is caused by
people taking time out of work, being
between jobs or looking for a job.
The one cause of its evolution is decline of
one industry and rise of the other and labour
take some time before moving to the other
industry. This type of unemployment is
short-term in nature.
Seasonal Unemployment
It is an account of the seasonal nature of the
productive activities, i.e., some productive
activities are carried out only for certain
duration of a year. Therefore, the persons
employed in such activities are unemployed
during off-season. This, generally, occurs in
agro-based industries.
Disguised Unemployment
It is a situation, in which more persons are
employed to do a job which can be done with
equal efficiency by less number of workers.
Structural Unemployment
It refers to a mismatch of job vacancies with
the supply of labour available, caused by
shifts in the structure of the economy.
304 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 305
Structural joblessness results from things like skills mismatches and policy to address
such mismatches is inherently longer term in scope, involving education and
encouraging innovation.
Technological Unemployment
Technology has always displaced some work and jobs. Thus, technological
unemployment is a term used to describe the lack or loss of jobs due to technological
changes or innovations. This type of unemployment typically comes from workers either
being replaced by machines or having their jobs made easier and require fewer workers to
accomplish the same task. It is one of the reasons of jobless growth.

IMPORTANCE OF
AGRICULTURE
● Agriculture is the primary industry in
India. The agriculture sector of India has
occupied almost 43% of India’s
geographical area and 58% of the rural
households depend on agriculture as
their principal means of livelihood.
● Its importance to the Indian economy
can be gauged from the following facts.
Contribution to GDP
● According to the new series of national
income released by CSO at 2011-12
prices, the share of agriculture in total
GDP is 17% (Approx) in 2017-18.
Contribution to Employment
● Agriculture provides livelihood to more
than half of the population.
● In 2019, it contributed around 52% to
the total employment in the country.
Contribution to Trade
● Although, the share of agricultural products in total trade of India
is declining due to export diversification.
● Agriculture sector plays a crucial role in
inclusive growth by directly attacking
poverty and containing inflation. It is
also an important source of raw material
for a vast segment of industry.
Agriculture and Five Year Plans
● The highest outlay on agriculture was
during the First Plan, it was 31%.
● The Intensive Agricultural District
Programme (IADP) followed by High
Yielding Variety Programme (HYVP) was
introduced during the Third Plan. First
and Fifth Plan were the only plans,
which achieved the set targets.
● Tenth Plan did not set any targets for
crop production.
● The growth rate of agriculture during the
Ninth and Tenth Plan were 2.44% and
2.02% respectively.
Agriculture in Eleventh Five
Year Plan
● Eleventh Plan (2007-12), recognising the
importance of agriculture in promoting
inclusive growth, fixed the agriculture
growth rate of 4%. Actual outlay in the
Eleventh Plan is estimated to be 18.5%
of the total plan outlay. Contract farming
was encouraged in fruits, vegetables and
other crops.
● The average annual growth rate of GDP
in agriculture and allied sectors during
11th plan was 3.7 per cent.
Agriculture in Twelfth
Five Year Plan
● The approach paper aims at growth rate
of 4% per annum in agriculture sector,
with foodgrains growing at about 2% per
year and non-foodgrains growing at 5.6%.
● The approach paper has emphasised on
technology as the main vehicle for
improving productivity in agriculture as
natural resources are fixed. Severely
indicting the public sector research in
agriculture the Twelfth Plan encourages
Public Private Partnership (PPP) in
agriculture so as to bridge the gap in
dryland areas and rapidly diversify
agriculture.
● It emphasises on greater road
connectivity, development of
horticulture, dairying and other animal
husbandry to further improve the
market acces to the farmers.

Green Revolution
● The Green Revolution in India refers to a
period when Indian agriculture was
converted into an industrial system due
to the adoption of modern methods and
technology such as the use of High
Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds, tsactors,
irrigation facilities, pesticides and
fertilizers.
● It was launched in the year 1966 and was
the brainchild of Norman Borlaug,
though in India, it was made successful
by Dr MS Swaminathan. The term
‘Green Revolution’ was coined by
Dr William Gaud.
● The achievement of Green Revolution
were rise in cereal production especially
wheat and rice, change in cropping
pattern in favour of wheat and increase in
employment opportunities.
● The weaknesses of Green Revolution
were growth of capitalistic farming, side
tracked land reforms, widened income
and regional disparities and
environmental degradation.
● The Green Revolution demanded high
yielding seed, increasing irrigation,
pesticides in fertilizer.
Farmer's Commission
■ A National Commission on farmers was
appointed in 2004, under the Chairmanship of
Dr MS Swaminathan, which interalia
suggested an Agricultural Renewal
Action Plan (ARAP).
■ The ARAP comprised of soil health
enhancement, irrigation water supply
augmentation and demand management, credit
and insurance, technological reforms and
assured and remmunerative marketing.
Second Green Revolution
● The call for Second Green Revolution was
given by then Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh at the 93rd Science Conference in
2006.
● The Second Green Revolution seeks to
build up on the achievements of first
Green Revolution and bridge the
regional and crop imbalance, which were
not addressed by First Green Revolution.
● The Second Green Revolution seeks to
cover dryland farming and concentrate
on the small and marginal farmers. It
seeks to raise the foodgrain production to
400 million tonnes by 2020.

Evergreen Revolution
● Concept given by renowned agricultural
scientist Dr MS Swaminathan.
● The concept emphasises on ‘organic
agriculture’ and ‘green agriculture’ with
the help of integrated pest management,
integrated nutrient supply and
integrated natural resource
management.
● The core of the evergreen revolution is
‘sustainability’.
White Revolution
● White revolution is relates to
phenomenal growth in milk production.
To increase the pace of White
Revolution, the operation flood was
started. The father of operation flood

These are as follows
● Saffron Energy Revolution for
promotion and better utilisation of solar
energy.
● White Revolution to ensure cattle
welfare and further the goals of White
Revolution.
● Blue Revolution for fishermen’s welfare,
cleansing rivers and sea and conserving
water.
Food Security in India
● The need for food self-sufficiency was
borne out on account of the experience
gained from the PL-480 programme of
the USA in the year 1966.
● Food security implies access by all people
at all times to sufficient quantities of food
to lead an active and healthy life.
Essentially, it involves
■ quantitative dimension in term of food
self-sufficiency;
■ qualitative dimension in form of
nutritional requirement; and
■ purchasing power dimension so as to
ensure access to all
through employment generation
programmes.

Revenue Deficit
There are various ways to represent and
interpret a government’s deficit. The
simplest is the revenue deficit which is just
the difference between revenue receipts
and revenue expenditures.
Revenue deficit = Revenue expenditure
− Revenue receipts
Capital Deficit
An imbalance in a nation’s balance of
payments capital account in which
payments made by the country for
purchasing foreign assets exceed
payments received by the country for
selling domestic assets.
In other words, investment by the
domestic economy in foreign assets is less
than foreign investment in domestic
assets. This is generally not a desirable
situation for a domestic economy.
Capital deficit = Capital receipts
− Disbursement on capital account
Fiscal Deficit
This is the sum of revenue and capital
expenditure less all revenue and capital
receipts other than loans taken.
This gives a more holistic view of the
government’s funding situation since it
gives the difference between all receipts
and expenditures other than loans taken
to meet such expenditures.
Fiscal Deficit = Difference between
country’s expenditure and earnings
Fiscal deficit = Revenue receipts (Net tax
revenue + Non-tax revenue) + Capital
receipts (only recoveries of loans and
other receipts) – Total expenditure (Plan
and non-plan).
Primary Deficit
Amount by which a government’s total
expenditure exceeds its total revenue,
excluding interest payments on its debt.
Primary deficit = Fiscal deficit − Interest
payments.

Glossary
Absolute Advantage The ability to
produce more units of a good or service
than some other producer, using the
same quantity of resources.
Aggregate Demand (AD) A schedule
(or graph) that shows the value of
output (real GDP) that would be
demanded at different price levels.
Aggregate Supply (AS) A schedule (or
graph) that shows the value of output
(real GDP) that would be produced at
different price levels. In the long run,
the schedule shows a constant level of
real GDP at all price levels, determined
by the economy’s productive capacity at
full employment. In the short run, the
aggregate supply schedule may show
different levels of real GDP as the price
level changes.
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) A
machine that provides cash and
performs banking services (for deposits
and transfers of funds between
accounts,) automatically, when
accessed by customers using plastic
cards coded with Personal
Indentification Numbers (PINs).
Balance of Payments Deficit An
imbalance in a nation’s balance of
payments, where more currency is
flowing out of the country than is
flowing in. This unequal flow of
currency is considered unfavourable
and can lead to a loss of foreign
currency reserves.
Balance of Payments Surplus An
imbalance in a nation’s balance of
payments, in which more currency is
flowing into the country than is flowing
out. This unequal flow of currency is
considered favourable and can lead to
an increase in foreign currency
reserves.
Balance of Trade The part of a nation’s
balance of payments accounts that deals
only with its imports and exports of
goods and services. The balance of trade
is divided into the balance on goods
(merchandise) and the balance on
services. If the value of a country’s
exports of goods and services is greater
than its imports, it has a balance of trade
surplus. If the value of a country’s imports
of goods and services is greater than its
exports, it has a balance of trade deficit.
Balanced Budget A financial plan, in
which income is equal to expenses.
Blue Chip Stocks Stocks in large,
nationally known companies that have
been profitable for a long time and are
well-known and trusted.
Command Economy An economy, in
which most economic issues of
production and distribution are
resolved through central planning and
controlling.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) A price
index that measures the cost of a fixed
basket of consumer goods and services
and compares the cost of this basket in
one time period with its cost in some
base period. Changes in the CPI are
used to measure inflation.
Cost-Push Inflation Inflation caused by
rising costs of production.
Crowding-Out Increased interest rates
and decreased private investment
caused by government borrowing.
Currency Devaluation A government
adjusts the value of the nation’s
currency so that it buys less of foreign
currencies than before.
Current Account Part of a nation’s
balance of payments accounts; records
exports and imports of goods and
services, net investment income and
transfer payments with other countries.
Current Account Balance The inflow of
the goods, services, investment income
and transfer accounts into the
domestic country from foreign
countries netted against the outflow of
goods, services, investment income and
transfer accounts from the domestic
country to foreign countries.
Demand-Pull Inflation Inflation caused
by increasing demand for output or ‘too
much money chasing too few goods.’
Depreciation A reduction in the value
of capital goods over time due to their
use in production.

rate that is determined by the
international demand for and supply of
a nation’s money; a rate free to rise or
fall (to float).
Hyperinflation A very rapid rise in the

profits.
Initial Public Offering (IPO) A company’s
first sale of stock to the public. When a
company ‘goes public’, it sells blocks of
stock shares to an investment firm that
specialises in initial offerings of stock
and resells them to the public.
Market Failures The systematic over
production or underproduction of some
goods and services that occurs, when
producers or consumers do not have to
bear the full costs of transactions they
undertake. Usually related to
externalities or the need for public
goods.
Monopolistic Competition A market
structure, in which slightly
differentiated products are sold by a
large number of relatively small
producers and in which the barriers to
new firms entering the market are low.
Monopoly A market structure in which
there is a single supplier of a good or
service. Also, a firm that is the single
supplier of a good or service, for which
there are no close substitutes; also
known as a monopolist.
Monopsony A market situation, in which
there is only one buyer of a resource.
Also, a firm that is the only buyer of a
resource; also known as a monopsonist.
Natural Monopoly An industry, in which
the advantages of large-scale production
make it possible for a single firm to
produce the entire output of the
market at a lower average cost than a
number of firms each producing a
smaller quantity.
Non-Price Competition Competition by
firms trying to attract customers by
methods other than reducing prices;
examples include advertising and
promotional gifts.
Oligopoly A market structure, in which
a few, relatively large firms account for
all or most of the production or sales
of a good or service in a particular
market and where barriers to new
firms entering the market are very
high. Some oligopolies produce
homogeneous products; others
produce heterogeneous products.
Open Market Operations The buying
and selling of government bonds and
securities by the federal Reserves to
central bank reserve and the money
supply.
Pegged Exchange Rate An exchange
rate that is fixed within a certain range
or against a major currency or basket
of currencies.
Perfect Competition A market
structure, in which a large number of
relatively small firms produce and sell
identical products and in which there
are no significant barriers to entry into
or exit from the industry.
Progressive Tax A tax that take a
larger percentage of income from
people in higher-income groups than
from people in lower-income ones; the
US federal income tax is an example.
Recession A decline in the rate of
national economic activity, usually
measured by a decline in real GDP for
atleast two consecutive quarters (i.e. 6
months).

SCIENCE
Physics is the study of nature and its laws. The word physics has been derived from a
Greek word physis which means nature. Physics is one of the academic disciplines,
perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy.
Units
Measurement of any physical quantity
involves comparison with a certain basic
arbitrarily chosen and widely accepted
reference standard called unit.

Dimensions of Physical
Quantities
Dimensions of a physical quantity are the
powers, to which the fundamental
quantities must be raised to represent that
quantity completely. There fore, the
dimensional formula of a quantity is
expressed in terms of fundamental
quantities, commonly mass M, length L and
time T. Any physical quantity is either a
scalar or a vector.
e.g. Force =
−
[ ] MLT 2
, Density =
−
[ ] ML 3
Scalar Quantities
Physical quantities which have magnitude
only and no direction are called scalar
quantities. e.g. mass, speed, volume, work,
time, power, energy etc.
Vector Quantities
Physical quantities which have both
magnitude and direction and also obey
triangle law of vector addition are called
vector quantities.
e.g. displacement, velocity, acceleration,
force, momentum, torque etc.
KINEMATICS
It is the branch of mechanics, which deals
with the motion of object.
Distance
● The length of the actual path covered by a
body in a particular time interval is called
distance. It is always positive.
● It is a scalar quantity.
● Its unit is metre.
Displacement
● The difference between the final and the
initial position of an object is called
displacement. It may be positive,
negative or zero.
● It is a vector quantity. Its unit is metre.
● The magnitude of displacement may or
may not be equal to the path length
traversed by an object.
Displacement ≤ Distance
Speed
● Speed is the distance covered by a
moving body in per unit of time interval.
● It is a scalar quantity. It is always equal to
or greater than magnitude of the velocity.
● The average speed of a particle for a
given interval of time is defined as the
ratio of total distance travelled to the
total time taken.

● If a body is moving on a circular path,
then after completing one complete
cycle, its average velocity is zero.
Uniform Velocity
An object is said to be moving with uniform
velocity if it undergoes equal
displacements in equal intervals of time.
Non-Uniform Velocity
An object is said to be moving with nonuniform or variable velocity if it undergoes
unequal displacements in equal intervals
of time.
Relative Velocity
When two bodies are moving in the straight
line, the speed (or velocity) of one with
respect to another is known as its relative
speed (or velocity).
v
AB = velocity of A with respect to B
= − v v A B
Acceleration
● It is the rate of change of velocity. Its SI
unit is m s/ 2
. It is a vector quantity.
● When the velocity of a body increases
with time then its acceleration is positive
and if velocity decreases with time then
its acceleration is negative and is called
retardation or deceleration.
● Acceleration of an object is zero, if
it is at rest or moving with uniform
velocity.

MOTION/REST
If the position of a body or a system of
bodies does not change with time, it is
said to be at rest.
On the other hand, if the position change
with time, it is said to be in motion.
A particle in rest does not have the speed
and acceleration, while a particle in the
motion has its speed and also may have
some acceleration, if the speed changes
with respect to time.

Two Dimensional Motion
In this motion of a body is described in a
rectangular co-ordinate axis.
Projectile Motion
● When a particle is projected so that it
makes certain angle with horizontal then
the motion of the particle is said to be
projectile. Path of a projectile is parabolic
in nature.
● The initial velocity u of the projectile can
be resolved into two components

● For maximum range θ = ° 45 .
Therefore, a long jumper takes
jump at an angle of 45°.
● For maximum height θ = ° 90 .
● The horizontal range is the same
when the body is projected at θ or
(90° – θ).
● When a body is dropped freely
from the top of the tower and
another body is projected
horizontally from the same point,
both will reach the ground at the
same time.
● When two balls of different
masses are projected horizontally
they will reach ground at same
time.
Circular Motion
● When an object moves along a
circular path, then its motion is
called circular motion e.g. motion
of top etc. If an object moves along
a circular path with uniform
speed, its motion is called uniform
circular motion. It is accelerated
even if the speed of the body is
constant. The motion of a satellite
is an accelerated motion.
● The acceleration is directed
towards the centre and is given by
a
v
r
=
2
, where v is the speed and r
is the radius. This is called
centripetal acceleration.
FORCE
Force is a push or pull which can change the
position or direction of a body.
Centripetal Force
A body performing circular motion is acted upon
by a force which is always directed towards the
centre of the circle. This force is called centripetal
force. Any of the forces found in nature (such as
frictional force, gravitational force, electrical
force, magnetic force etc) may act as a centripetal
force.
● Cyclist bends his body towards the centre on a
turn while turning to obtain the required
centripetal force.
● Generally, in rain the scooter slips at the
turning of a road because the friction between
tyre and road is reduced. Due to this, necessary
centripetal force is not provided. Roads are
banked at turns to provide the required
centripetal force for taking a turn.
Centrifugal Force
Pseudo Force When we in a non-inertial frame of
reference to apply Newton’s laws, we have to apply
a force on the object equal to mass times in
opposite direction of acceleration or retardation of
the frame. Centrifugal force is such a Pseudo
force. It is always equal and opposite to centripetal
force.
Cream separator, centrifugal drier etc work on the
principle of centrifugal force.
NEWTON’S LAWS
OF MOTION
First Law
● “Every body retains its state of rest or state of
uniform motion, until an external force is
applied on it.” This law is also known as law of
inertia or law of Galileo.
● First law gives the definition of inertia. Inertia
is the virtue of a body due to which it tries to
retain its state.
Inertia is of three types
Inertia of rest
Inertia of motion
Inertia of direction
● A person sitting in a moving car falls forward,
when the car stops suddenly. This is because
the feet of the passenger comes to the rest along
with the car, but the upper part of his body,
tends to remain in motion due to inertia of
motion.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 351
● The dust particle come out from a
carpet, when it is beaten with a stick
due to their inertia of rest.
● Inertial Frame Whenever the frame of
reference is moving with uniform
velocity or is at rest.
● Non-Inertial Frame Whenever the
frame of reference is accelerating or
retarding or rotating is called noninertial frame of reference.
Second Law
● ‘‘The force applied on a body is equal
to the product of mass of the body
and the acceleration produced in it
e.g. F ma = .’’
● The second law of motion gives the
definition of force.
● A force is any influence that causes an
object to undergo a certain change,
either concerning its movement,
direction and geometrical structure.
● SI unit of force is Newton (N).
Linear Momentum
● The product of the mass and the
velocity of a body is called the linear
momentum of the body.
● It is a vector quantity. Its unit is kg-m/s.
∴Linear momentum = × Mass Velocity
● A heavier body has a larger linear
momentum than a lighter body moving
with the same velocity.
● In the absence of external forces, the
total linear momentum of the system
remains conserved.
Application of Conservation of
Linear Momentum
● When a man jumps from a boat to the
shore, the boat slightly moves away
from the shore. Rocket works on the
principle of conservation of
momentum.
● When a bullet is fired from a gun, the
gun recoils or gives a sharp pull in
backward direction.
Impulse
● If a force acts on a body for a very short
time ∆t, then the product of force and
time is called the impulse.
● Impulse = Change in momentum
= × Force Time interval
● Its SI unit is N-s or kg-m/s.
Concept of Impulse
■ A cricketer moves his hands backwards while
catching a ball.
■ A person jumping from a height on a ‘concrete’
floor receives more injury than when jumping
on a spongy floor.
■ Vehicles like cars, buses and scooters are
provided with shockers.
■ Bogies of the trains are provided with buffers to
avoid severe jerks during shunting of trains.
Buffers increase the time-duration of jerks
during shunting. This reduces the force with
which bogies push or pull each other and thus
severe jerks are avoided.
Third Law
● “Every action have equal and opposite
reaction.” Action and reaction always act
on the different bodies.
● On firing the bullet, the gunner is pushed
in backward direction.
● When the boatman is jumped from the
boat, the boat is pushed back.
● In a rocket, gases are ejected with a great
speed from the rocket backwards and
rocket is pushed forwards.
● While swimming, a person pushes the
water backwards (action). The water
pushes the swimmer forward with the
same force (reaction).
Equilibrium
● If the resultant of all the forces acting on a
body is zero, then the body is said to be in
equilibrium. If a body is in equilibrium, it
will be either at rest or in uniform motion.
If it is at rest, the equilibrium is called
static, otherwise dynamic.
● Static equilibrium is of the following two
types
(i) Stable Equilibrium If on slight
displacement from equilibrium
position a body has tendency to regain
its original position, it is said to be in
stable equilibrium.
352 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
(ii) Unstable Equilibrium If on a slight displacement from equilibrium position, a
body moves in the direction of displacement and does not regain its original
position, the equilibrium is said to be unstable equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the
centre of gravity of the body is at the highest position.
Neutral Equilibrium
If on slight displacement from equilibrium position a body has no tendency to come back
to its original position or to move in the direction of displacement, it is said to be in
neutral equilibrium.
● In neutral equilibrium, the centre of gravity always remains at the same height.
Condition for Stable Equilibrium
For stable equilibrium of a body, the following two conditions should be fulfilled
(i) The centre of gravity of the body should be at the minimum height.
(ii) The vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the body should pass through
the base of the body.
Centre of Mass Centre of mass of a body (system of particles) is a point where the entire
mass of the body is supposed to be concentrated. We can define position of centre of mass

are position vectors of constituent particles.
FRICTION
● If we slide or try to slide a body over a surface, the motion is resisted by a bonding
between the body and the surface. This resistance is called frictional force.
● The opposite force that comes into play when one body tends to move over the surface
of another body but actually motion has yet not started is called static friction.
● The maximum value of the static frictional force which comes into play when a body
just begins to slide over the surface of another body is called limiting frictional force.
● When two bodies actually roll on each other (as in case of ball bearing), the rolling
friction comes into play.
● When two bodies actually slide over each other, sliding friction comes into play.
● When a body moves over the other body, then the force of friction acting between two
surfaces in contact in relative motion is called Kinetic Friction.
● µ µ µ s r > >κ
, here µ ,µs κ
and µr
are called coefficient of static, kinetic and rolling friction
respectively.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Friction
● Walking is possible due to friction.
● The transfer of motion from one part of a machine to other part through belts is
possible by friction.
● Brake works on the basis of friction.
● Friction causes wear and tear of the parts of machinery in contact. Thus, their lifetime
gets reduced.
Methods of Reducing Friction
● By polishing, by lubrication, by proper selection of material and by using ball bearing
friction can be reduced to some extent.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 353
Work, Energy and Power
WORK
When a body is displaced by applying a
force on it, then work is said to be done. If a
body is displaced by a distance s on
applying a force F on it, then work done
W F s Fs = ⋅ = cos , θ where ‘θ’ is the angle
between the force and the direction of
displacement. It is a scalar quantity. Its unit
is joule (J).
Positive Work Done
● Positive work means that force is applied
along the direction of displacement. e.g.
when a horse pulls a cart on a level road,
when a body falls freely under
gravitational pull.
Negative Work Done
Negative work means that force is opposite
to displacement. e.g. when a positive
charge is moved towards another positive
charge, when a body is made to slide over a
rough surface.
Zero Work Done
If the force is perpendicular to the
displacement and if either the force or the
displacement is zero, work done is zero. e.g.
when a body is moved along a circular path
with the help of a string, when a coolie
travels on a platform with a load on his
head and when a person does not move
from his position but he may be holding any
amount of heavy load.
ENERGY
● It is defined as capacity of doing work. Its
unit is joule in SI and erg in CGS system.
● Mechanical energy is in two forms;
kinetic energy and potential energy.
Kinetic Energy

where, p is the linear momentum.
● When momentum is doubled, kinetic
energy becomes four times.
● Kinetic energy of air is used to run wind
mills.
● Kinetic energy of running water is used
to run the water mills.
● A bullet fired from a gun can pierce a
target due to its kinetic energy.
● If a body is moving in horizontal circle
then its kinetic energy is same at all
points, but if it is moving in vertical
circle, then the kinetic energy is
different at different points.
Potential Energy
● It is the energy possessed by a body by
virtue of its position.
● Suppose a body is raised to a height h
above the surface of the earth, then
potential energy of the body = mgh.
● When a body is falling downwards, then
its potential energy goes on changing to
kinetic energy.
● The potential energy of the wound
spring of a clock is used to drive the
hands of the clock.
● The potential energy of water in dams
is used to run turbines in order to
produce electric energy using the
generators.
Conservative and
Non-conservative Forces
A non-dissipative force is known as
conservative force e.g. gravitational force,
electrostatic force. Non-conservative
forces are dissipative forces e.g. frictional
forces, viscous force.
Law of Conservation of Energy
● According to the law of conservation
of energy, ‘‘Energy can neither be
created nor be destroyed but it can only
be transformed from one form to
another.”
● The sum of all kinds of energies in an
isolated system remains constant at all
times.
354 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science

1 MW = 106 W
1 Horse Power (HP) = 746 W
1 watt/second (W-s) = 1J
1 watt/hour (W-h) = 3600 J
1 kilowatt hour (kW-h) = × 3.6 106
J
Torque

is known as the moment of the force or
torque. Torque is a vector quantity.

GRAVITATION
In 1686, Newton stated that in the universe
each particle of matter attracts every other
particle. This universal attractive force is called
gravitation.
Gravitational Force
● It is always attractive in nature.
● It is the weakest force but is a long range
force.
● Mathematically it is represented as
F
GMm
r
G =
2
where, FG
is gravitational force, G is
gravitational constant, M is the mass of first
particle, m is the mass of second particle
and r is the distance between them.
● This is called Newton’s universal law of
gravitation.
● The value of G is 6.67 10 N m / kg 11 2 2 ×
−
-
Gravity
● It is the force by which the Earth attracts
a body towards its centre.
● The acceleration due to gravity is the rate of
increase of velocity of a body falling freely
towards the Earth. It is represented by
g
GM
R
e
e
=
2
where, Me
is the mass of the Earth and Re
is
the radius of Earth.
● The value of g at the surface of Earth is
9.8 m/ s2
.
● The Earth is surrounded by an
atmosphere of gases due to gravity. The
value of g on the Moon is 1/6th of that on
the Earth surface.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 355
Variation in the Value of g
● When we go above the surface of the
Earth, the acceleration due to gravity
goes on decreasing.
● When we go below the surface of the
Earth, the acceleration due to gravity
goes on decreasing and becomes zero
at the centre of the Earth.
● Decreasing the rotational motion of
Earth, the value of g increases.
● When we go from the equator towards
the poles, the value of g goes on
increasing.
● If Earth stops its rotation about its own
axis, then at the equator the value of g
increases and consequently the weight
of body lying there increases.
● The value of g is maximum on the
surface of the Earth.
Centre of Gravity
● The centre of gravity of a body is that
point at which the whole weight of the
body appears to act.
● It can be inside the material of the
body or outside it.
● For regularly shaped body, the centre
of gravity lies at its geometrical
centre.
Mass
● The mass of a body is the quantity of
matter contained in it.It is a scalar
quantity and its SI unit is kg.
● Mass is measured by an ordinary
equal arm balance.
● Mass of body does not change from
place-to-place and remains constant.
Weight
● The weight of a body is the force with,
which it is attracted towards the
centre of the Earth. It is a vector
quantity and its SI unit is Newton
(N).
● It is measured by a spring balance.
● It is not constant and it changes from
place to place.
Weight of a Body in a Lift
■
If lift is stationary or moving with uniform speed
(either upward or downward), the apparent
weight of a body is equal to its true weight.
■
If lift is going up with an acceleration, the
apparent weight of a body is more than the true
weight. If lift is going down with an acceleration,
the apparent weight of a body is less than the
true weight.
■
If the cord of the lift is broken, then it falls freely.
In this situation, the weight of a body in the lift
becomes zero. This is the situation of
weightlessness.
■ While going down, if the acceleration of lift is
more than acceleration due to gravity, a body in
the lift goes in contact of the ceiling of lift.
SATELLITE
● The heavenly body which revolves around
the planets is called satellite. Moon is a
natural satellite of Earth.
● The speed of a satellite does not depend
upon the mass of the satellite.
● A satellite revolving very close to Earth’s
surface has a period of revolution about 84
min and its speed is nearly 8 km/s.
● Every body inside the satellite is in a state of
weightlessness. Total energy of the satellite
is negative.
● Artificial satellites are of two types
Geostationary and Polar satellites
(i) The satellite whose time period is 24 h, is
called geostationary satellite. It is used
to reflect TV signals and telecast TV
programs from one part of the world to
another. This satellite revolves around
the Earth at a height of 36000 km.
INSAT-2B and INSAT-2C are
geostationary satellites of India.
(ii) Polar satellites revolve around the
earth in polar orbits at a height of
approximately 800 km. The time period
of these satellites is approximately 84
minute. These satellites are used in
weather forecasting, in studying upper
region of the atmosphere, in mapping
etc. PSLV Series Satellites are Polar
Satellites of India.

given to the body to enable it to
escape away from Earth’s
gravitational field is called escape
velocity. It is given by

2
Its value on the Earth’s surface is
11.2 km/s.
● The value of the escape velocity of a
body does not depend on its mass. Its
value on the moon surface is
2.38 km/s. So, there is no
atmosphere around the moon.
● Escape velocity is 2times the orbital
velocity.
● Satellites are launched with the
escape velocity as needed.
Kepler’s Laws
● All planets move around the Sun in elliptical
orbits having the Sun at one foci of the orbit.
● The areal speed of a planet around the Sun
is constant.
● The square of the period of revolution ( ) T of
any planet around the Sun is directly
proportional to the cube of its mean distance
from the Sun (a) i.e. T a 2 3 ∝ .
Quick Digest
■ The Earth rotates on its axis from West to East.
This rotation makes the Sun and the stars appear
to be moving across the sky from East to West.

matches or other programmes with the help of a
communication satellite, which is a
geostationary satellite.

General Properties of Matter
Matter It is the substance that occupies
definite space and mass which is perceptible
to sense.
ELASTICITY
● It is that property of the material body by
virtue of which the body opposes any
change in its shape or size when deforming
forces are applied to it, and recovers its
original state as soon as the deforming
forces are removed.
● Steel is more elastic than rubber.
● Elastic Limit The maximum limit of the
external force upto which elasticity of the
body is maintained.
Plasticity
● The property of a body by virtue of which it
does not regain its original configuration
even after the removal of deforming force
is called plasticity.
● Putty, paraffin wax are nearly perfectly
plastic bodies.
Stress
The internal restoring force acting per unit
area of cross-section of the deformed body is
called stress. Its unit is N m2
/ or pascal.
Strain
● The change in length, volume, shape
of the body per unit of the original
value under the application of the
deforming force is called strain. Strain
is unit less quantity.
● Hooke's law and Modulus of
Elasticity The ratio of stress to strain
is a constant for the material and is
called modulus of elasticity.
E =
Stress
Strain
● It is also called Hooke’s law, which
states that within the limit of elasticity
the strain produced in a body is directly
proportional to the stress applied to it.
● Young’s Modulus If strain is
longitudinal, then the modulus of
elasticity is called Young’s modulus.
● Bulk Modulus If under the effect of
uniform pressure, the volume of the
body changes it is called the bulk
modulus of elasticity.
● Modulus of Rigidity The ratio of
tangential stress to shearing strain is
called modulus of rigidity.
MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS
PRESSURE
● It is defined as force acting normally on unit
area of the surface.
Pressure =
Normal force
Area
● Its unit is N m/
2
also called pascal. It is a
scalar quantity.
● Pressure in a liquid is given by p h g = ρ
where, h is the height, (ρ) is density of the
liquid and g is acceleration due to gravity.
● Atmospheric pressure of 1 atm
= × 1.01 10 N/m 5 2
= 760 torr
● Atmospheric pressure decreases with
altitude. This is why (i) it is difficult to cook
on the mountain, (ii) the fountain pen of a
passenger leaks in aeroplane at height.
● Atmospheric pressure is measured by
barometer. The slow rise in the barometric
reading is the indication of clear weather.
● Sudden fall in barometric reading is the
indication of storm.
● Slow fall in barometric reading is the
indication of rain.
DENSITY AND
RELATIVE DENSITY
● The density of a substance (ρ) is defined as
the ratio of its mass (M) to its volume (V).
i.e. Density Mass
Volume
=
Its unit is kg/ m3
.
● Density of water is maximum at 4°C.
● The relative density is defined as the ratio
of the density of the substance to the
density of water at 4° C i.e.
Relative density
=
°
Density of substance
Density of water at 4 C
● Relative density has no unit.
● Relative density is measured by hydrometer.
● Ice floats on water surface as its density
(0.92 g/cm3
) is lesser than the density of
water (1 g/cm3
).
● The density of human body is less than the
density of water but the density of head is
greater than the density of water.
● Therefore, during swimming a person
displaces the water with hands and
legs and thus total weight of displaced
water becomes equal to the weight of
the body.
● If ice floating in water in a vessel
melts, the level of water in the vessel
does not change.
● The density of sea water is more than
that of normal water. This explains
why it is easier to swim in sea water.
Pascal’s Law
● The pressure exerted anywhere at a
point of confined fluid is transmitted
equally and undiminished in all
directions throughout the liquid.
● Hydraulic lift, hydraulic press,
hydraulic brake work on the basis of
Pascal’s law.
BUOYANCY
● The upward force exerted by a fluid on
the immersed body is called buoyant
force or upthrust. The upthrust acts at
the centre of gravity of the liquid
displaced by the submerged part of the
body that is called the centre of
buoyancy.
● Buoyant force depends on the density
of the fluid and not on the density of
body and acts on centre of gravity of
displaced fluid.
Archimedes’ Principle
● When a solid body is immersed wholly
or partially in a liquid, then there is
some apparent loss in its weight. This
loss in weight is equal to the weight of
the liquid displaced by the body.
Law of Floatation
● Whenever a solid body is dipped into a
fluid, the fluid exerts force of
buoyancy on it, if the force of
buoyancy equals to weight of the solid,
the solid will remain in equilibrium.
This is called floatation.
● If density of material of body is equal
to density of liquid, the body floats
fully submerged in liquid in neutral
equilibrium.
358 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
● When body floats in neutral
equilibrium, the weight of the body is
equal to the weight of displaced
liquid. The centre of gravity of the
body and centre of gravity of the
displaced liquid should be on one
vertical line for the condition.

an unit length (l) of an imaginary line
drawn on the surface of liquid.
i.e. T
F

● Its unit is N/m.
● Cohesive force It is the
intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of the
same substance.
● Adhesive force It is the
intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of
different substance.
● The surface tension decreases with
rise in temperature and becomes zero
at the critical temperature.
● Due to the surface tension, rain drops
are spherical in shape.
■ Warm soup is tasty because at
high temperature its surface
tension is low and consequently
the soup spreads on all part of the
tongue.
■ When kerosene oil is sprinkled on
water, its surface tension
decreases.
Some Phenomena Based on
Surface Tension
● Small drops of mercury are
spherical, while large ones are flat.
● Formation of lead shots.
● Floatation of needle on water.
● Dancing of camphor on water.
● Bigger bubbles can be formed from
the soap solution easily than from
water.
● Detergent helps in cleaning the
clothes.
CAPILLARITY
● Capillary tube A long glass tube of very fine
(hair like) bore is called capillary tube.
● The phenomenon of rise or fall of liquids in a
capillary tube is called capillarity.
● The liquids which wet glass and for which
the angle of contact is acute rise up in the
capillary tube, while those which do not wet
glass, for which the angle of contact is
obtuse are fall down in the capillary tube.
Note The angle of contact is zero for pure water
and clean glass. It is 90° for water and
silver, 8° for ordinary water and glass and
135° for mercury and glass.
Some Practical Examples of
Capillarity
■ The kerosene oil in a lantern and the melted
wax in a candle, rise in the capillaries formed in
the cotton wick and thus they are burnt.
■ Writing nib is split in the middle so that a fine
capillary is formed in it. When it is dipped in ink
the ink rises in the capillary.
■ The water given to the fields rises in the
innumerable capillaries formed in the stems of
plants and trees and reaches the branches and
the leaves.
■ The farmers plough their fields after rains so
that the capillaries formed in the soil are broken
and the water remains in the lower layers of the
soil.
VISCOSITY
● It is the property of the liquid by virtue of
which it opposes the relative motion
between its adjacent layers.
● Viscosity of an ideal fluid is zero.
● Viscosity is the property of both liquids and
gases. With rise in temperature, viscosity of
liquids decreases and that for gases
increases.
● Viscosity of gases is much less than that of
liquids.
● Viscosity of liquid increases with increase in
pressure.
● Viscosity of a fluid is measured by
its coefficient of viscosity. Its SI unit is
(N sm−2
) or pascal-second (Pa-s).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 359
Terminal Velocity
● When a body falls in a viscous medium, its
velocity first increases and finally becomes
constant. This constant velocity is called
terminal velocity.
● Terminal velocity of a spherical body falling in
a viscous medium is proportional to the square
of radius of the body.
● When a liquid flow through a pipe, its speed is
maximum near axis and minimum near the
walls of the pipe.
● According to the equation of continuity the
speed of fluid flow becomes faster in the
narrow pipe.
● Stream Line Flow or Steady Flow In this
flow velocity at every point in the fluid will
remains constant.
● Turbulent Flow In this flow, the speed of
water is quite high, then the flow becomes
irregular.
● Critical Velocity The limiting velocity of a
liquid above which flow will become turbulent.
● Principle of Continuity For a tube of flow,
between two points having area of
cross-section A1
and A2
and velocities v1

A v A v 1 1 2 = 2
Bernoulli’s Theorem
● When an incompressible and non-viscous
liquid (or gas) flows in streamlined motion
from one place to another, then at every point
of its path the total energy per unit volume
(pressure energy + kinetic energy + potential
energy) remains constant.
i.e. p gh v + + = ρ ρ

constant
where, p= pressure, ρ = density of fluid, v =
velocity of flow, h= height of the tube of flow
● Venturimeter, Pitot tube, Bunsen’s burner,
atomizer, filter pump and magnus effect are
based upon the Bernoulli’s theorem.
SIMPLE HARMONIC
MOTION
● If a body moves to and fro on a straight line
about a fixed position, then its motion is called
simple harmonic motion.
When a particle executing SHM passes through
the mean position, then
■ no force acts on the particle.
■ velocity is maximum.
■ acceleration is zero.
■ kinetic energy is maximum.
■ potential energy is zero.
When a particle executing SHM is
at the extreme end, then
■ velocity of particle is zero.
■ acceleration of the particle is
maximum.
■ kinetic energy of particle is zero.
■ potential energy is maximum.
■ restoring force acting on the
particle is maximum.
Note
● In case of spring block system the
restoring force F kx = −
where, x is displacement of the block
from mean position and k is spring
constant.
● In case of spring block system, time
period of oscillation is given by
T
m
k
= 2π , where m is mass of the
block.
Periodic Motion
● Any motion which repeats itself
after a regular interval of time is
called periodic or harmonic
motion and the period of repetition
is called time period.
● Motion of hands of a clock, motion
of Earth around the Sun, motion of
the needle of a sewing machine are
the examples of periodic motion.
Oscillatory Motion
● If a particle repeats its motion after
a regular time intervals about a
fixed point, motion is said to be
oscillatory or vibratory.
● Motion of piston in an automobile
engine, motion of balance wheel of
a watch are the examples of
oscillatory motion.

● A pendulum clock goes slow in
summer and fast in winter.
● If a simple pendulum is suspended in
a lift descending down with
acceleration, then time period of
pendulum will increase. If lift is
ascending, then time period of pendulum
will decrease.
● If a lift falling freely under gravity, then the
time period of the pendulum will be
infinite. At Moon, the time period of simple
pendulum increases, because acceleration
due to gravity at Moon decreases.
Resonance
■
It is a phenomenon that occurs when a vibrating
system or external force drive another system to
oscillate with greater amplitude at a specific
preferential frequency.
Wave Motion
WAVES
● A wave is a disturbance which
propagates energy from one place to
the other without the transport of
matter.
● These are of two types
(i) Mechanical waves
(ii) Electromagnetic waves
Mechanical Waves
● The waves which require material
medium (solid, liquid or gas) for their
propagation are called mechanical
waves or elastic waves.
● These are of two types
1. Longitudinal waves
2. Transverse waves
Longitudinal Waves
● If the particles of the medium vibrate
in the direction of propagation of wave
motion, the wave is called longitudinal
wave. Waves on springs or sound
waves in air are examples of
longitudinal waves.
Transverse Waves
● If the particles of the medium vibrates
perpendicular to the direction of
propagation of wave, the wave is called
transverse wave. Waves on strings
under tension, waves on the surface of
water are examples of transverse waves.
Electromagnetic Waves
● The wave which do not require medium for
their propagation i.e. which can propagate
even though the vacuum are called
electromagnetic wave. They propagate as
transverse wave.
● The wavelength range of electromagnetic
wave is 10−4 m to 104m .
● Cathode rays, canal rays, α-rays, β-rays are
not electromagnetic waves. Light and heat
waves are examples of electromagnetic
waves.
Important Terms
Related to Waves
● Amplitude Maximum displacement of a
vibrating particle of medium from its mean
position is called amplitude.
● Phase The position of a point in time
(instant) on wave form cycle.
● Wavelength Wavelength is the distance
between any two nearest particle of the
medium, vibrating in the same phase.
● Frequency Frequency of vibration of a
particle is defined as the number of
vibrations completed by the particle in one
second.
Frequency ( ) f =
1
Time Period ( ) T
● Velocity of wave (v)
= Frequency (f) × Wavelength (λ)

SOUND WAVE
● It is longitudinal mechanical waves.
● The longitudinal mechanical waves
which lie in the range 20 Hz to
20,000 Hz are called audible or sound
waves.
● These are sensitive to human ear.
● The longitudinal mechanical waves
having frequencies less than 20 Hz,
called infrasonic.
● These are produced by earthquakes,
volcanic eruption, ocean waves and
elephants and whales.
● The longitudinal mechanical waves
having frequencies greater than
20000 Hz are called ultrasonic waves.
● Human ear cannot detect the ultrasonic
waves. But certain creatures like dog,
cat, bat, mosquito can detect these
waves. Bat produce ultransonic waves.
● Ultrasonic waves are used for sending
signals, measuring the depth of sea,
cleaning clothes and machinery parts of
clocks, removing lamp shoot from
chimney of factories and in
ultrasonography.
Speed of Sound
● Speed of sound is maximum in solids
and minimum in gases.
● Speed of sound in air is 332 m/s, in
water is 1483 m/s and in iron is 5130
m/s. Speed of sound basically depends
upon elasticity and density of medium.
● When sound enters from one medium
to another medium, its speed and
wavelength changes but frequency
remains unchanged.
● Speed of sound remains unchanged by
the increase or decrease of pressure.
● The speed of sound increases with the
increase in temperature of the
medium. The speed of sound in air
increases by 0.61 m/s when the
temperature is increased by 1°C.
● The speed of sound is more in humid air
than in dry air because the density of
humid air is less than the density of
dry air.
● The speed of sound in air is very slower as
compared to the speed of light in air.
Therefore, in rainy season, the flash of
lightning is seen first and the sound of
thunder is heard a little later.
● The speed of sound in a medium is given
by v
E
=
ρ
, where, E is modulus of
elasticity of the medium, ρ = density
For gases, v
p
=
γ
ρ
Where, p is pressure and γ is ratio of
specific heats.
Characteristics
of Sound Waves
Intensity
● Intensity of sound at any point in space is
defined as amount of energy passing
normally per unit area held around that
point per unit time. SI unit of intensity is
W/m2
.
● Intensity of sound at a point is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
of point from the source and directly
proportional to square of amplitude of
vibration, square of frequency and density
of the medium.
● The loudness depends on intensity as well
as upon the sensitivity of the ear.
Pitch
● It is that characteristic of sound which
distinguishes a sharp sound from a grave
sound.
● Pitch depends upon frequency of sound
waves.
● The pitch of female voice is higher than
the pitch of male voice.
● The pitch of sound produced by roaring of
lion is lower, whereas the pitch of sound
produced by mosquito whisper is high.
Quality
It is that characteristic of sound which
enables us to distinguish between sounds
produced by two source having the same
intensity and pitch.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 363
Shock Waves
● A body moving with supersonic speed
in air leaves behind it a conical region
of disturbance which spreads
continuously. Such a disturbance is
called shock wave.
● These waves carry huge energy and
may even make cracks in window
panes or even damage a building.
● The speed of supersonic wave is
measured in mach number. One Mach
number is the ratio of speed of source
to the speed of sound.
Mach number =
Velocity of source
Velocity of sound
● If Mach number > 1, body is called
supersonic.
● If Mach number > 5, body is called
hypersonic.
● If Mach number < 1, body is said to be
moving with subsonic speed.
Reflection
of Sound Wave
● When sound waves incidence on any
rigid surface, it returns to its original
medium, this is called reflection of
sound wave.
Echo
● The repetition of sound due to
reflection of sound waves, is called an
echo. To hear echo, the minimum
distance between the observer and
reflector should be 17.2 m. Persistence of
ear is 1/10 s.
● At the Moon the echo is not heared due
to absence of atmosphere.
● A group of soldiers on a bridge are
advised not to walk in steps because
their movement causes the bridge to
vibrate. If they walk in step, the
frequency of vibration may match the
natural frequencey of the bridge
structure and thus causing resonance.
This resonance of frequencey can
cause the bridge to collapse.
● When a gun is fired at a visible
distance, the sound heard a little after
the smoke is seen because the velocity
of light is much higher than that of
sound.
Sonar
● It stands for sound navigation and
ranging. It is used to measure the depth of
a sea, to locate the enemy submarines and
shipwrecks .
● The transmitter of a sonar produces pulses
of ultrasonic sound waves of frequency of
about 50000 Hz.
● The reflected sound waves are received by
the receiver.
DOPPLER’S EFFECT
● If there is a relative motion between
source of sound and observer, the
apparent frequency of sound heard by the
observer is different from the actual
frequency of sound emitted by the source.
This phenomenon is called Doppler’s
effect.
● When the distance between the source
and observer decreases, the apparent
frequency increases and vice-versa.
Uses
(i) By police to check over speeding of
vehicles.
(ii)At airport to guide the aircraft.
(iii)To study heart beats and blood flow in
different parts of the body.
HEAT
● It is a form of energy which flows from
hotter to colder body by virtue of
temperature difference.
● It is due to the kinetic energy of the
molecules constituting the body.
● Its units are calorie (cal), kilocalorie (kcal)
or joule (J).
● 1 cal = 4.18 J, 1 kcal = 1000 cal
TEMPERATURE
● It is the measurement of hotness or
coldness of a body.
● An instrument used to measure the
temperature of a body is called a
thermometer.
● The normal temperature of a human body
is 37° C or 98.4°F.
● − ° 40 is the temperature at which Celsius
and Fahrenheit thermometers read same.
364 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
● The clinical thermometer reads from
96°F to 110°F.
● Triple point is the state at which all the
three states of matter coexist. The
triple point of water is 273.16 K.

● The temperature at which Celsius and
Reaumur scale read the same is zero.
● Freezing point of mercury is − ° 39 C.
Hence, to measure temperature below
this temperature, alcohol thermometer
is used. Freezing point of alcohol is
115°C.
Pyrometer
● Pyrometer measures the temperature
of a body by measuring the radiation
emitted by the body.
● It cannot measure temperature below
800°C because at low temperature
emission of radiation is very small and
cannot be detected.
SPECIFIC HEAT
● It is the amount of heat required to
raise the temperature of a unit mass of
the substance by 1°C. Its unit is J/kg-°C.
● It is given by S
Q
m
=
∆θ
, where m is the
mass Q is amount of heat given to the
substance and ∆θ is change in
temperature.
● Specific heat of water is 4200 Jkg− − °
1 1 C
or 1
1 1 calg− − oC which is high in
comparison to most other substances.
Therefore, water is used as coolant in
radiator of vehicle.
● For most substances, the specific heat
increases with rise in temperature and
assumes a constant value at high
temperature.
● The specific heat of water, however
decreases with rise in temperature from
0°C to about 4°C after which it
increases with temperature.
● Mercury has low specific heat.
● Latent Heat of Vaporisation It is the
amount of heat required to change the
phase of the substance at constant
temperature.
● Hot water burns are less severe than that
of steam burns because steam has high
latent heat.
● Latent heat of fusion of ice is 80 cal/g.
● Latent heat of vaporisation of steam is 536
cal/g.
● Its SI unit is J/kg. Ice at 0°C appears
colder than that water at 0°C, because ice
takes more heat.
● Molar Heat Capacity at Constant
Pressure (CP
) It is the amount of
heat required to raise the temperature of 1
mole of gas by 1 K at constant pressure.
● Molar Heat Capacity at Constant
Volume (CV
) It is the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature of
1 mole of gas by 1 K at constant volume.

Thermodynamics
● Zeroth law of Thermodynamics If two
bodies A and B are separately in thermal
equilibrium with the third body C, then A
and B will be in thermal equilibrium with
each other.
● First Law of Thermodynamics The
amount of heat given to a system is used
up in two ways, first to increase the
internal energy and second to do the
external work.
● i.e. dQ dU = (internal energy) + dW
(work done).
● Second Law of Thermodynamics The
second law of thermodynamics is the
outcome of human experience under
which heat energy can be converted into
mechanical energy.
● Kelvin-Planck’s Statement It is
impossible to construct a device which
operates in a cycle that will take heat from
a body and convert it completely into the
work without producing any other effect.
● Clausius Statement It is impossible to
construct a self acting device which
operates in a cycle that will transfer heat
from a cold body to a hot body without
expenditure of work.
● Change in entropy at temperature T.
When ∆Q amount of heat exchanged is

Thermal Expansion
● It is the increase in size of the body on
heating.
● A solid can undergo three types of thermal
expansions
1. Linear expansion (expansion in
length).
2. Superficial expansion (expansion in
area).
3. Cubical expansion (expansion in
volume).
Note Almost every liquid expands with the
increase in temperature. But when
temperature of water is increased from 0°C
to 4°C, its volume decreases, after this its
volume increases.
Relation between the coefficients of linear,
superficial and cubical expansions:
α β γ : : : : = 1 2 3
Practical Applications
of Thermal Expansions
■ Telephone wires are given enough gap to
allow the wires for contraction in winter.
■ An ordinary pendulum clock runs faster in
winter but slower in summer, because in
summer the length of pendulum increases,
while in winter it decreases.
■
In the construction of bridges, ends of
steel girders are not fixed but placed on rolls to
allow free expansion and contraction in summer
and winter respectively to avoid any damage to
the bridge.
■ A gap is provided between the iron rails of the
railway track so that rails can easily expand
during summer and do not bend.
Humidity
● The amount of water vapour in air is called
as humidity.
● The amount of water vapour present in 1 m
3
air is called its absolute humidity.
● The ratio of amount of water vapour ( ) m
actually present in a certain volume of air
at a given temperature to the amount of
water vapour ( ) M required to saturate it, is
called Relative Humidity ( ) RH .
● Relative humidity is measured by
hygrometer.
● Relative humidity increases with the
increase of temperature.
Transmission of Heat
Transfer of heat from one place to other
place is called transmission of heat.
There are three processes, by which
transmission of heat takes place.
● Conduction
● Convection
● Radiation
Conduction
● In this process heat is transferred
without actual movement of the
particles of medium.
● In this process path of heat transfer is
irregular. In solid, transmission of
heat takes place by conduction
process.
● Mercury though a liquid is heated by
conduction and not by convection.
Convection
● In this process, heat is transferred by
the actual movement of particles of
the medium due to difference in
densities of different parts of the
medium.
● In liquid and gases transmission of
heat takes place by convection
process. This process is also slow.
● The chimney used in kitchen or in a
factory is based on the convection.
In rooms ventilators are provided to
escape the hot air by the process of
convection.
Radiation
It is the quickest way of transmission of
heat in which there is no need of
medium for transfer of heat. Heat from
the Sun reaches the Earth by radiation.
In this process, heat is transferred at the
speed of light.
Kirchhoff’s Law
● Kirchhoff’s law signifies that good
absorbers are good emitter.
● If a shining metal ball with some black
spot on its surface is heated to a high
temperature, the shining ball becomes
dull but the black spots shines brilliantly
because black spot absorbs radiation
during heating and emit in dark.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 365
366 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Perfectly Black Body
● A perfectly black body is one which
absorbs completely all the radiations
falling on its surface, whatever be the
wavelength.
Note Since perfectly black body is a perfect
absorber, hence according to Kirchhoff’s
law, it will also be a perfect radiator.
Stefan’s Law
● The radiant energy emitted by unit area
of perfectly black body per unit time is
directly proportional to the fourth power
of its absolute temperature.
E T ∝
4 ⇒ E T = σ 4
where, σis Stefan’s constant and its value
is 5.67 ×
− − − 10 8 2 4 Wm K
Newton’s Law of Cooling
● The rate of loss of heat by a body is
directly proportional to the difference in
temperature between the body and its
surrounding.
● Cooking utensils are made of
aluminium, brass and steel because
these substances have low specific heat
and high conductivity.
● In deserts day temperature are very high
and night temperature are extremely low
because the specific heat of sand is very
low. Therefore it absorbs the heat readily
and its temperature raises by a large
degree during the day. At night sand
radiates the heat equally readily making
the temperature loss.
● Human breath is visible in winter but not
in summer because in winter air is cold
and so water vapours present in the
human breath condense, making it
visible.
● A thick glass tumbler often cracks when
very hot liquid is poured into it because
the inner surface of the thick glass
tumbler coming in contact with the hot
liquid expands more in comparison with
the outer surface which has relatively
lower temperature. This unequal
expansion of inner and outer surfaces
causes the tumbler to crack.
● Water from a hand pump is warm in
winter and cold in summer because in
winter outside temperature is low and in
summer outside temperature is higher
as compared to the temperature of water
obtained from underground which
remains practically unchanged due to
Earth being bad conductor of heat.
LIGHT
● It is the radiation which makes our eyes
able to see the object. Its speed is
3 108
× m s/ .
● It is the form of energy. It is a transverse
wave.
● It takes 8 min 19 s to reach on the Earth
from the Sun.
● The light reflected from Moon takes
1.28 s to reach Earth.
● It represents the phenomenon of
reflection, refraction, interference,
differaction, scattering and polarisation.
Reflection of Light
● The return of light into the same
medium after striking a surface is called
reflection.
Laws of Reflection
There are two laws of reflection
(i) The angle of incidence is always
equal to angle of reflection.
(ii) The incident ray, normal and
reflected ray all lie in the same
plane at point of incidence.
Reflection from
Plane Mirror
● Size of image is always equal to size of
object.
● The image in a plane mirror appears as
far behind the mirror as the object is
infront of it.
● If the object is displaced by a distance a
towards or away from the mirror, then its
image will be displaced by a distance a
towards or away from the mirror.
● The minimum size of the mirror
required to see the full image of an
observer is half the height of the
observer.
● If the plane mirror is rotated in the
plane of incidence by an angle θ, then
the reflected ray rotates by an angle 2θ.
● Focal length of plane mirror is infinity. i.e.
power of the plane mirror is zero.
● Linear magnification produced by plane
mirror is 1.
● When two plane mirrors are kept facing
each other at an angle θ and an object is
placed between them, then

which reflecting surface side is spherical.

Uses of Mirrors
1. Plane mirrors are used as looking
glass.
2. Concave mirror is used as shaving
mirrors, used by doctors, shades of
table lamp, for search lights.
3. Convex mirror is used as back view
mirrors in vehicles, in street lamps etc.
Refraction of Light
● When a ray of light passes from
one medium to other, it bends from
its path. This phenomenon of
bending of light ray is called as
refraction of light.
● When a ray of light travels from one
medium to another the wavelength and
velocity of light changes, but the
frequency does not change.
Laws of Refraction
There are two laws of refraction
(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray
and the normal at the point of
incidence all lie on the same plane.
(ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of
incidence to the sine of the angle of
refraction is a constant for a given
medium

● Twinkling of stars is based upon
refraction.
● Due to refraction, rivers appear shallow,
coin in a beaker filled with water appears
raised, pencil in the beaker appear
broken.
● At sunset and sunrise, due to refraction,
Sun appears above horizon, while it is
actually below horizon.
● The duration of day appears to be
increased by nearly 4 min due to
atmospheric refraction.
● Writing on a paper appears lifted when a
glass slab is placed over the paper.
● The refractive index of a medium is
maximum for violet colour of light and
minimum for red colour of light.
● Refractive index decreases with rise in the
temperature.
Total Internal Reflection
of Light
● When a light ray goes to rarer medium
from denser medium, then as we increase
the angle of incidence, angle of refraction
also increases. The angle of incidence for
which the angle of refraction becomes 90°
is called critical angle.
● If the angle of incidence in denser
medium is greater than critical angle (C),
then the ray is reflected back into the
denser medium, this phenomenon is
called total internal reflection. It is
necessary for the total internal reflection
of light to occur that the light ray should
go to rarer medium from denser medium.
● Angle of incidence in denser medium
should be greater than critical angle.
● In desert, the phenomena of mirage
occurs due to total internal reflection.
● The air bubbles in glass paper weight
appear silvery white due to total internal
reflection. Sparkling of diamond is due to
multiple total internal reflection taking
place inside the diamond.
Scattering of Light
● When light ray passes through a medium
in which particles are suspended, whose
sizes are of the order of wavelength of
light, then light on striking these
particles, deviated in different directions.
This phenomenon is called scattering
of light.
● Red colour of light is scattered least and
violet colour of light is scattered most.
Therefore, danger signals are of red
colour.
● Blue colour of sky is due to scattering of
light. The brillant red colour of rising
and setting Sun is due to scattering of
light.
● Clouds appear white due to scattering
of light.
Optical Fibre
It is a device based on total internal
reflection by which a light signal can be
transferred from one place to the other
with a negligible loss of energy.
It is used in testing the internal organs of
human body i.e. endoscopy.
Lenses
● Lens is a transparent medium bounded
by two curved surfaces. Lenses are of
two types
(i) Concave or divergent lens.
(ii) Convex or convergent lens.

If the lens is immersed in a medium having
refractive index more than that of lens, then the
nature of the lens changes i.e. convex lens
behaves as convave lens and vice-versa.
■
If the lens is immersed in a medium having
refractive index equal to that of the lens, the
lens behaves as a plane glass plate.
■ An air bubble in water behaves as a concave
lens.
Power of Lens
● It is the reciprocal of focal length of lens. It
is measured in metre.
P

( )
● Its unit is dioptre ( ) D .
Prism
● It is a uniform transparent refracting
medium bounded by two plane surfaces
inclined at certain angle.
Dispersion of Light
● When a narrow beam of light is
incident on a prism, the emergent
beam is not only deviated, but at the
same time splits up into a coloured
band of seven colours. This
phenomenon is called dispersion of
light.
● The seven colours of band are violet,
indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and
red.
● Violet colour deviates through maximum
angle and red colour deviates through
the minimum angle.
● Red, green and blue are called primary
colours or basic colours.
Mixing of Colours
● Red + Green + Blue = White
● Red + Blue = Magenta
● Blue + Green = Peacock blue
(or Cyan)
● Red + Green = Yellow
● If all the colours of white light are
reflected back from the object, then it
appears white.
● And if all the colours of white light is
absorbed by an object, then it appears
black.
● Polarisation is the only phenomenon
which proves that light is a transverse
wave.
● The layer of kerosene oil over water
surface appear coloured in the
presence of sunlight due to proper
interference of light.
HUMAN EYE
● It is an optical instrument just like a
photographic camera. It forms the real
image of the object on retina of the
eye.
● For the normal eye, the range of vision
is from 25 cm to infinity.
Defects of Vision Myopia
● In this case, the person cannot see the
distant object clearly.
● Image is formed before the retina.
Concave lens is used for correcting
myopia.
370 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Hypermetropia
● In this case, the person cannot see near
object clearly.
● Image is formed behind the retina.
● Convex lens is used for correcting
hypermetropia.
Astigmatism
● In this case, the curvature of cornea becomes
irregular and image is not clear. Cylindrical
lens is used for correcting astigmatism.
Presbyopia
● In old age the power of accommodation of
the eye lens decrease, therefore, neither near
nor distant objects are clearly seen.
Presbyopia can be removed by using bifocal
lenses.
Cataract
● In this defect, an opaque, white membrane is
developed on cornea due to which a person
loses power of vision partially or completely.
● This defect can be removed by removing this
membrane through surgery.

● It is something that a body attains when it
loses or gains the electrons.

MATTER AND
ITS STATES
MATTER
● Matter is anything which has mass and
occupies space.
● It exists in five states, viz, solid, liquid,
gas, plasma and Bose-Einstein
condensate. Out of which the former
three are commonly seen.
States of Matter
The five states of matter are discussed below
Solids
● They have definite volume and definite
shape.
● They are incompressible and have
strongest intermolecular interactions.
● They are very dense as compared to liquid
and gas. e.g., wood, stone, iron, etc.
Melting Point
● It is a temperature at which a substance
converts from its solid state to liquid
state. Melting point of ice is 0° C.
● Melting point decreases in the presence
of impurity.
Sublimation
● It is the process of conversion of a
substance from the solid state to the gas
state without passing through an
intermediate liquid phase.
● It is used to separate a sublimate
(substance undergoing sublimation like
camphor, naphthalene, ammonium
chloride, etc) from non-sublimate.
Liquids
● They have definite volume but no definite
shape. They take the shape of the vessel
in which they are kept.
● They can flow, hence, considered as
fluids e.g., milk, water, mercury, etc.
Boiling Point
● It is a temperature at which vapour
pressure of a liquid becomes equal to
atmospheric pressure and at which a
substance converts from its liquid state
to gaseous state.
● It is different at different places.
● Boiling point of water at normal
conditions is 100° C.
● It usually decreases at high altitudes,
that’s why, at high altitudes, the boiling
point of water is less than 100°C and
more time is required to cook a food.
● Boiling point of water in pressure cooker
is high due to high pressure and hence,
less time is required to cook the food.
● Boiling point increases in the presence
of impurity.
Evaporation
● It is the process of conversion of a liquid
into vapours at any temperature below
its boiling point. It increases with
increase in surface area and
temperature.
● It produces cooling. That’s why we feel
cool when some nail polish remover or
spirit is kept on our palm.
Gases
● They have neither definite volume nor
definite shape. They take the shape and
volume of the container in which they
are filled.
● They are highly compressible.
● They can flow so considered as fluids,
e.g., air, oxygen and nitrogen.
Condensation
● It is the process of conversion of gas into
liquid or liquid into solid
● Solids, liquids and gases are inter
convertible by changing the conditions
of temperature and pressure.

CHEMISTRY
Plasma
● The fourth state of matter is called
plasma. This state contains ionised gas
with super energetic and super excited
particles.
● Fluorescent tube contains helium (He)
gas and neon (Ne) gas. Sign bulb
contains neon (Ne) gas.
Bose-Einstein Condensate
● In 1924-25, Satyendra Nath Bose and
Albert Einstein gave the information
about Bose-Einstein condensate. It is a
state of matter of a dilute gas of boson
cooled up to temperature which is very
close to absolute zero or -273.15°C. In
fact, it is a fifth state of matter.
Particles of Matter
Atoms
● It is the smallest particle of matter that
takes part in chemical reactions.
(by Dalton’s atomic theory).
● It can neither be created nor destroyed
(law of conservation of mass given by
Lavoisier).
● It does not exist in free state and has a
fixed atomic mass e.g., iron (Fe), gold
(Au), silver (Ag), etc.
Molecules
● These are the smallest part of the
matter that exist in free state.
● They are formed by the joining of two or
more atoms in fixed ratio (law of
multiple proportions given by Dalton).
● They have fixed molecular mass which
is obtained by adding the atomic masses
of all the atoms present in a molecule,
e.g., water (H O) 2
, ammonia (NH ) 3
,
carbon dioxide (CO ), 2
etc.
Pure Substances
A substance is said to be pure if all the
constituent particles of that substance are
the same in their chemical nature. e.g.,
all the elements and compounds are pure
substances.
Elements
● They contain only single type of atoms.
Elements combine to give molecules.
● Examples of elements are sulphur,
phosphorus , oxygen etc.
● Elements known at present are 118. Out
of which 94 are natural. Elements which
are liquid at room temperature are
mercury (Hg) and bromine (Br).
● Elements which become liquid at a
temperature slightly above the room
temperature ( ) 303 K are gallium (Ga) and
caesium (Cs).
● Elements have the following order of
abundance in earth crust : Oxygen >
silicon > aluminium > iron > calcium.
● Elements have the following order of
abundance in human body : Oxygen >
carbon > hydrogen > nitrogen.
Compounds
● These contain more than one kind of
atoms. These cannot be separated into
constituent atoms by simple physical
methods.
● Their examples are silica (SiO )2
, water
(H O) 2
, sugar (C H O ) 12 22 11 , salt (NaCl), etc.
Impure Substances
A substance is said to be impure, if all the
constituent particles of that substance are
not same in their chemical nature.
Mixtures
● These are obtained by mixing two or more
substances in any proportion.
● Mixtures can be homogeneous, i e. ., have
uniform composition throughout ( . ., e g salt
solution, sugar solution, air, true
solutions, etc) or heterogeneous, i e. .,have
non-uniform composition (e.g.,mixture of
salt and sugar, colloidal solutions, etc).
Solutions or True Solutions
● These are homogeneous mixtures of two
or more substances.
● A solution contain two components :
solute (in less quantity) and solvent (in
more quantity). Examples of solutions are
sugar solution, tincture of iodine
(solution of iodine in alcohol), aerated
drinks like soda water, air, alloys, etc.
● Concentration of solution may be
expressed by percentage, mole fraction,
parts per million, gram per litre, molarity
molality, normality, etc.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 383
Colloidal Solutions
● These are heterogeneous mixtures.
● These contain two phases, i e. ., dispersed
phase and dispersion medium.
● These can scatter light because of the
presence of large solute particles, i e. .,
they show Tyndall effect and Brownian
movement.
● Blue colour of sky is also due to
scattering of light by dust particles
suspended in air.
● They are separated by special technique
like centrifugation.
● Colloidal solutions are coagulated by
adding an electrolyte.
● Colloidal solutions are purified by
dialysis, which is also used in the
purification of blood with the help of
artificial kidney machine.
● Coagulation found its use in
purification of water by alum, stop
bleeding by FeCl 3
, formation of delta at
the junction of sea and river.
● They are of following types on the basis
of dispersed phase and dispersion
medium.

Model, was based upon α-particle
scattering experiment and suggests that
most of the part of an atom is empty.

orbits and could jump between these, but
could not freely spiral inward or outward in
intermediate states.
Planck’s Quantum Theory
According to this theory
1. Atoms and molecules could emit or
absorb energy only in the form of
discrete packets of energy called quanta.
2. The energy of quantum(E) is

Pauli Exclusion Principle
● It is the quantum mechanical principle
which states that no two identical
fermions (particles with half-integer
spin) may occupy the same quantum
state simultaneously.
or
● Only two electrons may exist in the same
orbital but these electrons must have
opposite spin.
RADIOACTIVITY
● It was discovered by Henry Becquerel but
term radioactivity was given by Madam
Curie. It is the process of spontaneous
disintegration of nucleus and is
measured by Geiger counter.
● It is a nuclear phenomenon, thus
remains unaffected by external factors
like temperature, pressure, etc.
Radioactive Rays
Radioactivity involves emission of α β, and
γ rays or particles and has units Curie,
Becquerel, Rutherford.
Alpha ( ) α Rays
● These rays consist of positively charged
helium nuclei (He ) ++ . They have +2unit
charge and 4 u mass.
● They have low penetrating power but
very high ionising power and kinetic
energy.
● An α-emission reduces the atomic mass
by 4 and atomic number by 2, thus, the
new nuclei formed occupy a position two
places left to the parent nuclei in the
periodic table (Soddy Fajans group
displacement law).
Beta ( ) β Rays
● These rays consist of negatively charged
electrons ( ) − 1
0
e and have − 1 unit charge
and zero mass.
● These are more dangerous than α-rays.
● These have high penetrating power as
compared to α-rays.
● A β-emission increased the atomic
number by one with no change in atomic
mass, thus, the new nuclei obtained
occupy a position one place right to the
parent nuclei in the periodic table
(Soddy Fajans group displacement law).
Gamma ( ) γ Rays
● These are electromagnetic radiation and
have very high penetrating power.
● These have low ionising power and
kinetic energy.
● Their emission does not affect the
position of nuclei in the periodic table.
Half-Life Period
It is the time in which a radioactive
substance remains half of its original
amount.
Nuclear Fission
● It is a process in which a heavy nucleus

coolant.
Nuclear Fusion
● It is a process which involves fusion of
two or more lighter nuclei to give a
heavier nuclei.

temperature ( > 106K), so also called
thermonuclear reactions.
● It is used in hydrogen bomb. Energy of
Sun is also a result of a series of nuclear
fusion reactions.
Hydrogen Bomb

CHEMICAL BONDING
● It is formed by elements to complete
eight electrons in their outer shell i.e., to
complete their octet.
● It results in decrease in energy and
increase in stability.
Ions
These are of two types : cation and anion.
Cations are formed by the loss of electrons
and carry positive charge, e.g., Na +

–
, etc.
Electrovalent Bond
or Ionic Bond
● It is a type of chemical bond formed
through an electrostatic attraction
between two oppositely charged ions.
● It is formed between a cation, which is
usually a metal, and an anion, which is
usually a non-metal, e.g.,

common salt (NaCl), lime (CaO),
magnesium oxide (MgO), etc.
● The energy required to separate the ions
of an ionic compound is called lattice
energy.
Covalent Bond
● It is a type of chemical bond that is
characterised by the sharing of electrons
between two atoms.
● It may be a single bond (), formed by
sharing of two electrons i.e., one electron
from each atom, double bond
(==), formed by sharing of four electrons
i.e., two electrons from each atom, or
triple bond (≡≡), formed by sharing of six
electrons i.e., three electrons from each
atom.
● The geometry of few covalent molecule
H2O (water) – Bent, NH3
(ammonia) –
pyramidal, CH4
(methane)–tetrahedral,
CO2
(carbon dioxide) –linear.
● Single bond contains only 1 σ-bond;
double bond contains 1 σ and 1π-bond;
and triple bond contains 1σ and
2π-bonds.
390 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Covalent Compounds
1. They are non-conductor of
electricity.
2. They have low thermal
conductivity.
3. They are insoluble in water, but
soluble in non-polar solvents like
benzene, acetone, ether, etc.
4. They have low melting and boiling
points (diamond and graphite
have very high melting point.)
5. They are directional. So, have
definite geometry.
Coordinate or Dative Bond
● It is a special type of covalent bond
in which both the electrons for
sharing (i.e., shared pair of
electrons) are given by only one
atom.
● Coordinate compounds have
properties in between the ionic and
covalent compounds.
● Examples of coordinate compounds
are
Hydrogen Bond
● It is the attractive interaction of a
hydrogen attached to highly
electronegative atom (such as N, F,
O) with another electronegative
atom, such as nitrogen, oxygen or
fluorine.
● It is stronger (has energy 5 to
30 kJ/mol) than a van der Waals’
interaction.
● It occurs in both inorganic
molecules such as water and
organic molecules such as DNA.
● Ethanol, amine (except 3° amine),
etc., can form H-bond with water,
so these are soluble in water
although these are covalent
compounds.
van der Waals’ Interaction/Force
The attractive forces among the non-polar
molecules in solid or liquid states. These are
relatively weaker compared to normal chemical
bonds.
The ability of Geckos which can hang on a
glass surface using only one toe-to climb on sheer
surfaces has been attributed to the van der Waals’
forces between these surfaces and spatulae or
microscopic projections, which cover the hair-like
setae found on their footpads.
CHEMICAL REACTION
The process in which substances (reactants)
react to form new compounds (products), is
known as chemical reaction.
Types of Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions are of following types
Combination Reactions
In such reactions, two or more substances
combine to give a single substance, e.g.,

combustion reactions etc.
Endothermic Reactions
These are those reactions in which
energy is consumed, e.g., digestion,
photosynthesis, evoporation of water,

Redox Reactions
In such reactions, oxidation and
reduction occurs, simultaneously.
These are called disproportionation
reaction when the same element is
oxidised as well as reduced.
Oxidation
● It involves addition of oxygen or any
other electronegative element like
fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), nitrogen
(N), etc.
● It involves removal of hydrogen ( )H
or any other electropositive element
like sodium (Na). It involves loss of
electrons i.e., increase in the
positive charge of ion.
Reduction
● It involves addition of hydrogen or
any other electropositive element.
● It involves removal of oxygen or any
other electronegative element. It
involves gain of electron, i.e.,
decrease in oxidation state.

reduce other substances, transfer electrons to
another substance; e.g., electropositive element,
metals such as lithium, sodium, magnesium,
iron, zinc, and aluminium, hydride transfer
reagents, such as NaBH4

Periodic Properties
and their Trends
Periodic properties are those which
shows a regular trend along a period
and a group.
Atomic Size
● It generally increases on moving
down the group because number of
shells increases.
● It decreases along a period from left
to right. Thus, size of alkali metal is
largest and that of halogens is
smallest in a period.
● Smallest atom is hydrogen and
largest atom is cesium.
● Most poisonous metal is plutonium.
Valency
● It is the combining capacity of an
element.
● It increases from 1 to 7 along a period
with respect to oxygen whereas with
respect to hydrogen, it first increases
from 1 to 4 and then decreases to 0.
● For alkali metal (i.e., sodium,
potassium, etc.,) it is 1, for alkaline
Earth metals (i.e., magnesium,
calcium, etc.,) is 2, for aluminium, it
is 3 and for nitrogen it is 3. It remains
the same in a group.
● For s-block elements, all the elements
in a group have same valency.
● For p-block elements, they show variable
valencies [P(3, 5), S(4, 6) but tendency to
show higher valency decreases when we
move down in a group due to inert pair
effect.
● For d-block elements Fe(2, 3), Cu (1, 2) the
elements of same group may have different
valencies, and the element itself exhibit
different valencies.
Oxidation State
● It is the hypothetical charge that an atom
would have if all bonds of atoms of different
elements were removed.
● It is typically represented by integers, which
can be positive, negative or zero.
● It is + 1 for hydrogen, − 2 for oxygen (except
in peroxide i.e., − 1 and in F O2
i.e., + 2), + 1
for sodium and potassium and + 2 for
magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium
(Sr).
● It is − 1for fluorine (always).
● It is zero for a neutral molecule.
Example : Calculation of oxidation number of
Mn in KMnO4
.
Let the oxidation number of Mn is X.
KMnO4 = 1 + 4 X + ( ) − = 2 0
Therefore, the oxidation number of Mn in
ΚM On 4
is + 7.
Metallic Character
● It is the tendency of an element to form
cation by the loss of electrons.
● It decreases along a period from left to right
and increases in a group on moving
downwards.
Ionisation Energy
● It is the energy required to remove an
electron from the outermost shell of an
isolated gaseous atom.
● It generally increases along a period
from left to right but ionisation energy of Be,
Mg, Ca, Sr is larger than the ionisation
energy of B, Al, In, Tl, respectively.
Moreover, ionisation energy of N, P is larger
than ionisation energy of O, S respectively.
● It generally decreases in a group on moving
downwards.
Electron Affinity (EA)
● It is defined as the energy liberated when an
extra electron is added to an atom.
394 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Newly Discovered Element
Ununseptium, recently discovered, a
superheavy chemical element with atomic
number 117, is a member of group-17 in the
periodic table below the five halogens
(fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and
astatine). Its synthesis was claimed in
Dubna, Russia by a joint Russian-American
collaboration. In 2014, the GSI Helmholtz
Centre for Heavy lon Research in Germany
also claimed to have successfully repeated
original experiment. Ununseptium is a
temporary systematic name that is
intended to be used before a permanent
one is established. It is commonly called
element-117, instead of ununseptium.
● It increases across a period from left to
right but EA of II(2), 15 group and 0
group is 0 or positive.
● It decreases on moving down a group.
● It is highest for chlorine.
Electronegativity
It is the tendency of an atom in a molecule
to attract the shared electrons towards itself.
It increases regularly along a period from left
to right and decreases on moving down a
group. It is highest for fluorine.
Metals and their Properties
● These are the elements which are hard,
lustrous, ductile, malleable, sonorous
and conductor of heat and electricity in
their solid as well as molten state.
● These form oxide with air. These oxides
are generally basic, but oxides of zinc
and aluminium are amphoteric, i.e.,
have acidic as well as basic properties.
● These evolve hydrogen gas when reacts
with water and acids.
● Metals which are highly reactive
displace the less reactive metals from
their salts. The order of reactivity is :
potassium (K) > calcium (Ca) >
sodium (Na) > magnesium (Mg) >
aluminium (Al) > zinc (Zn) > iron (Fe)
> lead (Pb) > hydrogen (H) > copper
(Cu) > mercury (Hg) > silver (Ag) >
gold (Au) (Thus, gold is less reactive
metal).
e.g., When iron nails are kept in copper
sulphate solution (blue), iron being more
reactive displaces the copper from copper
sulphate solution and thus, the blue
colour of solution disappears.
● Mercury (metal) is liquid at room
temperature.
● Metal with lowest density is lithium.
● Tungsten is the metal having highest
melting point.
● Reactivity of metals increases while that
of non-metals decreases on moving
down the group.
● Sodium and potassium are soft and
highly reactive metals. These react with
air and water. That’s why these are kept
in kerosene oil. Silver, gold and
platinum do not react with air even on
strong heating.
● Sodium and potassium burn in water
while calcium floats over it.
● Copper (Cu) is the first metal used by
man.
● Pb (lead) is a bad conductor of electricity.
● Ti (Titanium) is called strategic metal.
Non-Metals and their Properties
● These may be solid, liquid or gas
(bromine is the only liquid non-metal).
● These are soft, non-lustrous, brittle,
non-sonorous and non-conductor of heat
and electricity.
● These have low melting and boiling
points.
● These form oxides with oxygen which are
generally acidic.
● Examples are noble gases [i.e., helium
(He), neon-(Ne), argon (Ar), krypton
(Kr), xenon (Xe) and some other p-block
elements].
● Diamond is the hardest substance known.
Iodine is lustrous. Melting point is very
high for diamond and graphite.
● The order of hardness of some
substances is : diamond > corundum >
topaz > quartz.
Helium
● It is a noble gas (discovered by Lockyear
and Janssen).
● It is used for filling balloons and other
lighter aircrafts. Helium, when mixed
with Oxygen, is used by deep-sea divers
for breathing and for respiratory patients.
● It is used as a heat transfer agent in gas
cooled nuclear reactors.
Neon
It was discovered by Ramsay and Travers. It is
used in neon signs.
Argon
It was discovered by Rayleigh and Ramsay. It
is used to generate inert atmosphere for
welding and to fill incandescent light bulbs.
A mixture of mercury vapours and argon gas
is filled in tube lights.
Xenon
It is called stranger gas. Xe, when mixed
with Kr, used in high intensity, short
exposure photographic flash tubes.

and turns red litmus blue.
● Acids reacts with metal to liberate
hydrogen gas.

oxides are basic in nature. Whereas,
bases reacts with non-metallic oxides to
give salt and water which shows that
non-metallic oxides are acidic in nature.

■ Aqua Regia is a mixture of conc HCl and conc.
HNO3
in a ratio of 3 : 1 and is used to dissolve
noble metals like gold, platinum, etc.
■ Pickles are always kept in glass jar because
acid present in them reacts with metal of
metallic pot.
● Acidity is the number of replaceable OH

Ca(OH) 2
. Whereas Basicity represents
the number of replaceable H

● If it is vulcanised with 5% S, it is used for
making tyres and if with 30% sulphur, it is
used in making battery cases.
● Trans-polyisoprene is called
gutta-purcha.
● Thiokol rubber is a polymer of ethylene
chloride and sodium polysulphide and is
used in the manufacture of hoses, tank
lining, engine gaskets and rocket fuel.
Explosives
Some examples of explosives are
trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitroglycerine or
trinitroglycerine (TNG), cyclotrimethylene
trinitroamine (RDX, also called cyclonite).
AIR, WATER
Air or Atmosphere
● Air is a homogeneous mixture of
different gases.
● It has the following composition : 78%
nitrogen; 21% oxygen, 0.03-0.05%
carbon dioxide (CO ), 2
argon, etc.
● An atmosphere is a layer of these gases
surrounding a planet or other material
body of sufficient mass that is held in
place by the gravity of the body.
Constituent of Atmosphere
It has different density at different heights
from sea level. Thus, several layers are
formed. These layers are
Troposphere
● It is the lowest layer of atmosphere,
extend upto a height of 18 km from sea
level.
● It is a turbulent and dusty zone which
contains air (N , O , CO ) 2 2 2 much water
vapours and clouds.
Stratosphere
● It lies between 18-60 km above sea level.
● It is the layer which contains ozone
layer (protects us from harmful UV rays
coming from the Sun), so called
ozonosphere.
Mesosphere
● It extends from 60-85 km above sea
level.
● Its temperature decreases with height
and reaches to − ° 100 C. That’s why
when any meteors enter in mesosphere,
it burns up.
Thermosphere
● It extends up to 10-50 km above sea
level.
● In this region, the temperature can rise
to 1500°C, a person would not feel warm
because of the extreme low pressure.
● The international space station orbit is
also in thermosphere.
408 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Exosphere
● It lies between 500-1600 km above sea
level.
● This region contains ionised gases.
● Beyond this region, interstellar space is
present.
Major Gases in Air
Oxygen( ) O2
● It was discovered by K Scheele.
● It is obtained during photosynthesis.
● It is colourless, odourless, neutral gas
which gets adsorbed over alkaline
pyrogallol.
● It is non-combustible, but helps in
combustion. It form oxides with metals
and non-metals.
● It is used for artificial respiration and in
oxy-hydrogen flame and, oxygen-ethylene
flame and oxygen-acetylene flame (used
for welding) and as a rocket fuel.
● Metal oxides are generally basic but
alumina (Al O ), 2 3 zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin
oxide (SnO )2
are amphoteric oxides.
● Carbon dioxide (CO2
) is acidic while
carbon monoxide (CO) is neutral.
Ozone (O )3
● It is an allotrope of oxygen.
● It is used as an insecticide, in purification
of water, to preserve food, to synthesise
artificial silk and camphor, act as a
bleaching agent.
Nitrogen (N2
)
● It was discovered by Rutherford (in 1771).
● It is a colourless, odourless,
non-combustible, non-poisonous gas.
● It is neutral and lighter than air
containing N2
.
● It is filled in sealed packets and bulbs to
create inert atmosphere.
● Living beings die in an environment of
nitrogen.
● Soil contains several pores filled with air
containing N2
. At the time of raining these
pores get filled with water. That’s why
earthworm come at the surface to breath.
Carbon Dioxide (CO )2
● It is used by plants for photosynthesis.
● It is 1.5 times heavier than water.
● It turns the lime water milky which
disappears in the excess of CO2 due to
conversion of milky calcium carbonate
(CaCO ) 3
into soluble calcium
bicarbonate.
● It is used to extinguish fire and for
artificial respiration when mixed with
oxygen (carbogen).
● It is dangerous to have charcoal fire
burning in a closed room because it
produces carbon monoxide gas, which
is suffocating.
● Plants respire at night and releases
CO2 which reduces oxygen content of
air required for breathing, so it is
dangerous to sleep under trees at night.
● Eno (fruit salt) produces effervescence
if dissolved in water due to evolution of
CO2
gas.
Water( ) H O2
● It contains two elements : hydrogen and
oxygen (H O) 2
. It constitute about 70%
part of Earth.
● It is a universal solvent and maintains
the body temperature due to its high
specific heat.
● It has boiling point 100 C° and freezing
point 0 C. ° Its density is maximum at
4°C.
Types of Water
There are different types of water
Soft water Soft water easily form lather
with soap due to absence of soluble salts,
calcium and magnesium.
Hard water It does not form lather with
soap due to presence of Calcium and
magnesium salts.
It is of two types
Temporary Hard Water
● It contains bicarbonates of calcium and
magnesium.
● It is converted into soft water by boiling
or by adding calculated quantity of
calcium hydroxide (Clark’s process).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 409
Permanent Hard Water
● It contains sulphates and chlorides of
calcium and magnesium.
● It is converted into soft water by
adding sodium carbonate (Na CO ), 2 3 or
calgon or zeolite.
Heavy Water
It is deuterium oxide,D O2
(molecular mass
20). It is used as a moderator in nuclear
reactors, in the study of mechanisms of
chemical reactions involving hydrogen and
its compounds, etc.
POLLUTION
Pollution is the contamination of
material particles or energy into the
natural environment. It causes adverse
effects on the ecosystem.
Types of Pollution
Air Pollution
● It occurs when any harmful gases,
dust, smoke enters into the
atmosphere and make it difficult for
plants, animals and humans to
survive.
● Common respiratory diseases such as
asthma, bronchitis can occur.
Water Pollution
● It is due to the presence of foreign
substances like sewage, algae, soluble
salts, etc., in water.
● It can also be due to presence of
metals in water. This pollution causes
following diseases.
Metal Disease
Chromium and
Arsenic
Cancer
Cadmium Itai-itai disease
Mercury Minamata disease
● For a healthy aquatic life, dissolved
oxygen (DO) is 5-6 ppm.
● For clean water, BOD (biochemical
oxygen demand) is less than 5 ppm
while for highly polluted water, it is 17
ppm or more.
Soil Pollution
It is alteration in soil. It is caused by
pesticides, insecticides (e.g., DDT, BHC etc)
herbicides (e.g., sodium chlorate), fungicides
(e.g., organomercury compounds).
Hazardous Effect of Pollution
Greenhouse Effect
It is the heating of Earth and its objects
because of the trapping of IR radiations by
carbon dioxide ( ), CO2 methane ( ) CH4
, nitric
oxide (NO), ozone (O3
), chlorofluoro carbons
(CFCs) and water vapours.
Global Warming
● It is a result of increased concentration of
greenhouse gases.
● It may result in melting of ice caps and
glaciers, spreading of several infectious
diseases like malaria, sleeping sickness,
etc.
Acid Rain (By Robert Augus)
● It has pH less than 5. It is due to the
presence of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur
in air that dissolve in rain water and forms
nitric acid and sulphuric acid.
● It damages the buildings and other
structures made up of limestone and
results in several diseases such as skin
infections.
● pH of normal rain water is 5.6.
Pollutants
These are the substances that contaminate the
environment and of two types
Primary Pollutants
These persist in the environment in the form
in which they are produced e.g., sulphur
dioxide (SO ), 2 nitrogen dioxide (NO2
), etc.
Secondary Pollutants
● These are the products of reaction of
primary pollutants e.g., PAN
(Perocyacylnitrates), ozone ( ), O3
aldehyde,
etc.
● The order of different pollutants to cause
pollution is carbon monoxide (CO), SO2 >
hydrocarbon > particulates > nitrogen
oxides.
410 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
● It is formed by incomplete combustion.
● It is a colourless, odourless gas.
● It contain a triple bond and are fairly
polar, resulting in a tendency to bind
permanently to haemoglobin molecules,
displacing oxygen, which has a lower
binding affinity.
Particulates
These are minute solid particles and liquid
droplets dispersed in air. e.g., mists, dusts,
smoke, fumes, etc.
Disease Cause
Pneumoconiosis Due to inhalation of coal
dust.
Silicosis Due to inhalation of free
silica (SiO ). 2
Black lung disease Found in workers of coal
mines.
White lung disease Found in textile workers.
Byssinosis Due to inhalation of
cotton fibre dust.
Smog
It is a consequence of particulate pollution
and is of two types
Classical Smog
● It is also called London type smog.
● It is reducing in nature.
● It is formed in cool humid climate when
carbon soot particles combine with
gaseous oxides of sulphur.
Photochemical Smog
● It is also called Los Angeles smog.
● It occurs in warm, dry and sunny climate
by the action of sunlight on unsaturated
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide.
● It is oxidising in nature.
Tropospheric Pollution
Presence of undesirable solid or gaseous
particles in the air. Gaseous air pollutants
are S, N and C, H S, 2 hydrocarbons, ozone
and other oxidants. Particulate pollutants
are dust, mist, fumes, smoke, smog, etc.
Stratospheric Pollution
● Stratospheric pollution means depletion
of ozone layer (ozone hole) by certain
compounds like chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), oxides of nitrogen (which are
released into upper atmosphere from
engines of supersonic transport planes).
● CCl 4
, halons and methyl chloroform also
deplete ozone layer.
● Depletion of ozone layer can cause skin
cancer, sunburn, ageing of skin, cataract
or even blindness and also increases the
evaporation of surface water.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 413
INTRODUCTION
● Biology is a natural science
concerned with the study of life and
living organisms, i.e., plants and
animals. It is classified into two part:
Botany and zoology.
● Study of plants is called Botany and
study of animals is called Zoology.
Zoology and Botany are collectively
called Biology. The term ‘Biology’
was coined by Lamarck and
Treviranus.
● The scientist who gave his thought
for the first time about the life of
plants and animals was Aristotle.
That’s why he is known as the Father
of Biology. He is also known as the
Father of Zoology.
● Theophrastus is known as Father of
Botany.
CHARACTERISTIC OF
LIVING ORGANISMS
● They have cellular organisation and also
respire, i.e., take in O2
and evolve CO2
.
● Metabolism is one of the most important
characteristic feature of living organism. It
comprises two phases that are anabolism
(constructive phase) and catabolism
(destructive phase.)
● They take nutrition for their growth.
● They have tendency to reproduce.
● They have the ability to respond to changes
in both internal and external environment
i.e., they have sensitivity. Their survival
chances are maximum.
● They move from place to place as animals or
some bacteria. Plants cannot move but
some movement can occur in plants.
The Cell
● The Cell is the basic structural and
functional unit of all known living
organisms. It is the smallest unit of
life and is often called the building
block of life.
● The branch of biology which deals
with the study of cell, is called
Cytology.
● Robert Hooke coined the term cell
when he saw honey-comb like
structure in the section of cork.
However, he only discovered cell wall.
● The first living cell was discovered by
Leeuwenhoek.
Types of Cells
These are of two types
1. Prokaryotic Cells
(Pro=primitive, karyos=nucleus)
These are primitive cells, lacking a
well defined nucleus and most of
the other cell organelles, e.g.,
bacterial cell.
2. Eukaryotic Cells (Eu = true, karyos =
nucleus) These have a well defined
nucleus and membrane bound cell
organelles. These are present in
unicellular and multicellular plant and
animal cells.
Prokaryotic Cell Eukaryotic Cell

Facts about Cell
■ The largest known cells are unfertilised Ostrich
egg cells (size 6 inch diameter).
■ The smallest cell is of PPLO (Mycoplasma
gallisepticum of size 0.1-0.3µm).
■ Human nerve cell is the longest animal cell.
■ Largest unicellular plant is Acetabularia (10 cm)
and animal is Amoeba (1 mm).
■ The largest human cell is the female ovum and
the smallest human cell is the red blood cell.
Parts of Cell and their
Functions
A typical cell consists of cell wall and
protoplasm.
Protoplasm of Cell
It is the living fluid matter present inside the
plasma membrane. The fluid present outside
the nuclear membrane is called cytoplasm and
the fluid present inside the nuclear membrane
is called nucleoplasm. Deutoplasm is the
non-living matter of the cell.
Cell Wall
It is present in plant cells, bacteria, fungi, algae
and some archaea. It is composed of cellulose
in plants and chitin in fungi. It is non-living. Its
main function is to provide shape and rigidity to
the cell.
Plasma Membrane
The cell is enclosed by a thin membrane called
the cell membrane or plasmalemma. It is
composed of proteins and phospholipid
molecules. It is elastic, living and selectively
permeable, i.e., provide passage for various
substances.
Mitochondria
● It was discovered by R Altman in
1880 and the term mitochondria
was coined by Carl Benda.
● It is bounded by a double membrane. The inner membrane has
many folds, called the cristae. Fluid
(called matrix) is present on interior,
which contains many enzymes and
coenzymes. It is a semi- autonomous
(can form its own copies) organelle
and is called power house of the
cell because in it, stepwise oxidation
of fuel occurs which results in
release of chemical energy. This
energy is stored in the form of ATP.
Plastids
● These are present only in plant cells
and are of three types– chloroplasts
(green), leucoplasts (white) and
chromoplasts (of various colours
except green). Chloroplast is the site
of photosynthesis as it contains
chlorophyll, while leucoplasts are
storage plastids. Chloroplast is called
the kitchen of the cell.
● The red colour of tomatoes is due to
the presence of lycopene pigment,
i.e., chromophore.
● The colour of carrot is due to
carotene pigment.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It was discovered by KR Porter. These
are hollow membranous system having
ribosomes (thus called Rough ER) or
no ribosomes (thus called Smooth
ER).
Rough endoplasmic reticulum is
the site of protein synthesis, while
smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the
site of synthesis of steroids and
detoxification.
Golgi Apparatus
It was discovered by Camillo Golgi. It
is made up of sac-like flattened
structures and play an important role
in secretion, transportation and
acrosome formation.

Nobel Prize in Physiology and
Medicine 2013
The Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine 2013 was
awarded jointly to James E Rothman, Randy W
Schekman and Thomas C Sudhof for their
discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic, a
major transport system in our cells. In general, we
call it Golgi body. Randy Schekman discovered a set
of genes that were required for vesicle traffic.
James Rothman discovered machinery that allows
vesicle to fuse with their targets to deliver the
stored matter..
Ribosomes
Ribosomes were discovered by GE Palade.
These are minute, non-membranous particles,
composed of RNA and protein. 70 S type of
ribosomes are found in prokaryotes, while 80 S
type in eukaryotes. These are the site of protein
synthesis.
Lysosomes
● Lysosomes were discovered by de Duve.
These are polymorphic organelles having
hydrolytic enzymes. These enzymes function
at (acidic) pH ~ 5. These are sometimes
called suicidal bags of the cell.
● Lysosome helps in carcinogenesis, i.e.,
conversion of a normal cell into cancerous
cell.
Centrosome
It was discovered by T Boveri. It is composed of
two set of centrioles and participate in the
formation of mitotic spindle during cell division.
Vacuoles
These are non-living reservior, bounded by
a membrane called tonoplast. Pigment
anthocyanin is present in the cell vacuole,
which provide colour to flowers. It stores toxic
metabolic waste and helps in osmoregulation.
Nucleus
It was discovered by Robert Brown. It contains
nucleoplasm, nucleolus and chromatin
material. Nucleolus is rich in protein and RNA.
All this material is covered up by a nuclear
membrane. Chromatin is the controlling
centre of cell as it form chromosomes.
Chromosome
Chromosome is thread-like structure,
found in the nucleus. Bead-like
structures found on chromosome are
called genes, which are made up of
DNA and are the carrier of genetic
information from generation to
generation. Chromosomes are units of
inheritance. In some viruses e.g.
retrovirus, RNA is the genetic
material.
Plant Cell Animal Cell
It has cell wall. Cell wall is usually
absent.
Plastids are found. Plastids are usually
absent.
Centrioles and
centrosome are
absent.
Centrioles and
centrosomes are
found in all cells.
A big vacuole is
present.
Vacuole is absent
or very small in
size.
Nucleic Acids
These contain the genetic
instructions used in the development
and functioning of all known living
organisms.
These are of two types : DNA and RNA.
Deoxyribonucleic
Acid (DNA)
● DNA was discovered by James
D Watson and Francis Crick, who
got Nobel Prize for this discovery.
● It is a long polymer made from
repeating units called nucleotides.
● Each nucleotide consists of a
nucleoside (i.e. nitrogenous base
and deoxyribose sugar) and a
phosphate group, joined together by
phosphodiester bonds.
● It has four bases, i.e. adenine,
guanine, cytosine and thymine.
● Adenine and guanine are the
purine bases; cytosine and thymine
are pyrimidine bases.
416 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)
● It is also made up of a long chain of
nucleotides.
● Each nucleotide consists of a
nitrogenous base, a ribose sugar, and
a phosphate group.
● It contains uracil in place of thymine.
● RNA is of three types—
mRNA (messenger RNA)
rRNA (ribosomal RNA)
tRNA (transfer RNA)
These three RNA’s take part in protein
synthesis.
Cell Division
● It is the process by which a cell
increase in number. It is essential for
the growth, development and repair
of the body.
● It is of two types – Mitosis and Meiosis
(i) Mitosis It occurs in unicellular
organism during asexual reproduction.
Each mitotic cell division results in the
formation of two daughter cells having
number of chromosomes equal to the
parent cell.
Tumour or cancer is a result of
uncontrolled mitosis.
(ii) Meiosis It occurs in reproductive cells
and is called reduction division because of
the presence of single set of chromosomes
(i.e., half of the parent chromosomes). It
results in the formation of four daughter
cells.
● Exchange of genetic material occurs
between chromatids (branches of
chromosome) of a diploid set during
pachytene stage of meiosis and is known as
crossing over.
BIOMOLECULES
Biomolecules are the substances that
are essential for a living being to
perform the basic functions,
e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids
(fats), nucleic acids and vitamins.
Carbohydrates
● It was believed that these are the
organic compounds which have carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of
1 : 2 : 1 but starch (C H O 6 10 5)n
and
some others are exceptions. So this
definition has been changed. According to
modern definition, these are the
polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones or their
derivatives.
● These are the source of energy and about
50-75% energy is obtained by the oxidation
of carbohydrates.
● The main end product of carbohydrate
digestion is glucose, which is called blood
sugar. It oxidises to give energy along with
CO2
and H O2
.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 417
DNA RNA
It usually occurs inside nucleus and in some
cell organelles like mitochondria and
chloroplast.
Very little RNA occurs inside nucleus. Most of it
is found in the cytoplasm.
DNA is the genetic material except in some
viruses.
RNA is not the genetic material except in
certain viruses, e g. ., HIV, reovirus.
It is double stranded with the exception of
some viruses like φ × 174.
RNA is single stranded with the exception of
some viruses, e g. ., double stranded in T2
, T4
,
T6 bacteriophage.
DNA shows regular helical coiling. There is no regular coiling except in parts of
RNA.
It contains deoxyribose sugar. It contains ribose sugar.
Nitrogen base thymine occurs in DNA along
with other three i.e. adenine, cytosine and
guanine.
Thymine is replaced by uracil in RNA. The
other three are adenine, cytosine and guanine.
It replicates to form new DNA molecules. It cannot replicate itself except in RNA-RNA
viruses.
DNA controls heredity, evolution, metabolism,
structure and differentiation.
RNA controls only protein synthesis.
● 1 gm glucose provides about 17 kJ energy
or 4.2 kcal energy.
● Carbohydrates are better fuel as
compared to proteins and fats as they
readily decompose to give energy.
● Main sources of carbohydrates are wheat,
maize, rice, potato etc.
The carbohydrates are categorised into
following three types
Monosaccharides
● These are simple sugars, which cannot be
hydrolysed further, e.g., ribose, glucose,
fructose, galactose etc.
● In human beings, blood glucose level is
100-120 mg/mL. Extra glucose, if any, is
converted into glycogen in the liver by a
process called glycogenesis.
● D-fructose is the sweetest of all sugars
and is found in fruit juice, honey etc.
Oligosaccharides
● They release 2-10 monosaccharides on
hydrolysis, like disaccharides, e.g.
sucrose, lactose maltose etc and
trisaccharides, like raffinose etc.
● Sucrose is also called invert sugar. It
gives glucose and fructose when
subjected to hydrolysis.
Polysaccharides
● They release more than ten
monosaccharides on hydrolysis. These
are non-sugars, i.e., do not have sweet
taste, e.g., cellulose, glycogen and starch.
● Cellulose is found in plant cell wall and is
digested by ruminants (like cow, goat,
buffalo, etc), but not by carnivorous or
omnivorous animals like human beings.
Thus, it acts as roughage in case of
human beings.
Function of Carbohydrates
● Carbohydrates provide energy, that acts
as reserve food, help in the synthesis of
nucleic acid and form exoskeleton of
animals. Excessive intake of carbohydrate
results in digestive problems and obesity.
Proteins
These are found in all living cells. These are
the compounds of carbon (C), hydrogen
(H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and sulphur
(S). These form 15% part of human body.
Snake venom, ricin of castor and bacterial
toxins are proteinaceous in nature. Main
sources of protein are groundnuts,
soyabean, pulses, fish etc.
Function of Proteins
● These are important for the growth and
repair of the body (75% of our body is
protein only). However, in the
deficiency of carbohydrates, these acts
as the source of energy. Protein also
control the development of genetic
characters.
● Deficiency of protein causes
Kwashiorkor (a disease in which hands
and legs of children get slimmed and the
stomach comes out) and Marasmus (a
disease in which muscles of children are
loosened). Kwashiorkor occurs in
children between 1 to 5 years of age and
marasmus in children below 1 year.
Lipids (Fats)
● These are also the compounds of carbon
(C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O).
Chemically, these are the ester of
glycerol and fatty acids. These are
present in cytoplasm, cell wall etc.
● The main source of fats are ghee, butter,
almond, cheese, egg yolk, meat,
soyabean etc.
● Fats are digested by enzymes called
lipases in the small intestine. Generally,
at 20°C, these are in solid state but if
their state is liquid at this temperature,
these are termed as oils.
● Fatty acids are of two types- Saturated
and Unsaturated. Saturated fatty acids
are found in coconut oil and palm oil,
while unsaturated fatty acids are found
in fish oil and vegetable oil.
● Excess of saturated fats raises the level
of blood cholesterol and may cause
arteriosclerosis. This may lead to
heart attack.
Function of Lipids
The main functions of lipids are
● These provide twice the energy than
that from carbohydrates.
● These remain under the skin and
prevents the loss of heat from the body.
418 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Malnutrition Effects
● Deficiency of fat results in dryskin and weight
loss.
● If fat is in excess, the body gets fatty and
result in several heart diseases and high
blood pressure.
● The skin fat, in case of whales and seals,
forms a thick layer called the blubber. It acts
as reserve food and also maintains the body
temperature.
Vitamin
● It was first discovered by FG Hopkin.
However, the term vitamin was coined by C
Funk.
● Vitamin is an organic compound, which
cannot be synthesised in sufficient quantities
by an organism and must be obtained from
the diet.
● They provide no calories, they only regulate
chemical reactions occurring in the
metabolism of the body.
These are divided into two groups
1. Fat soluble vitamin, viz. vitaminA, D, E and K.
2. Water soluble vitamin, viz.
vitamin-B and C.
● Vitamin-B12 contains cobalt.
Vitamin-D is synthesised in our skin
by the action of ultraviolet rays of
the sunlight. Vitamin-K is
synthesised in our colon by the
bacteria.
● Water soluble vitamins normally do
not show hypervitaminosis (this
disease occurs due to excess intake
of vitamins) as excess of these
vitamins is normally excreted
through urine.
● In balanced diet, all the important
nutrients (like carbohydrate,
protein, fats, vitamins etc.) are
available in sufficient quantity.

Biological Evolution
Origin of Universe
● The universe is made up of matter and
energy. Scientists believe that it was
formed about 10 to 13 billion years ago
as a vast, dense, red-hot and rotating
gaseous cloud of cosmic dust called the
“primaeval matter or ‘ylem’.
● Two hypothesis i.e., Big -Bang
(universe formation through a very big
explosion) and Nebular (universe
formation by the condensation of
gaseous cloud) were given to explain
origin of Earth.
ORIGIN OF LIFE
● Life originated on Earth about 3.5
billion years ago. Some philosophical
theories like special creation,
spontaneous generation, Biogenesis,
panspermia (life originated in the form
of pansperms from some unknown
part of the universe) or cosmozoic and
catastrophism (life orginated suddenly
from inorganic matter) were given to
explain origin of life.
● The first scientific account of the
origin of life was given by Russian
scientist AI Oparin in his book ‘Origin
of life’.
● The primitive atmosphere contained
hydrogen, methane, ammonia and
water vapour. In it, oxygen and ozone
were absent. Thus, it was believed that
life is originated from inorganic
substances by a series of complex
reaction.
● Hydrogen atoms were most numerous
and most reactive in the primitive
atmosphere. First, these combined
with all available oxygen atoms,
forming water and leaving no free
oxygen atoms. Thus, the primitive
atmosphere was ‘reducing’ unlike the
present ‘oxidising’ atmosphere. This
was also supported by Miller and Urey
in 1953.
● In Miller-Urey experiment, a mixture
of water, hydrogen, methane and
ammonia was cycled through an
apparatus and the organic compound,
amino acids were obtained.
Organic Evolution
More and more creation of organism by
gradual changes from low category animal to
higher animal is called organic evolution.
There are several evidences regarding
organic evolution.
Evidences from morphology
and anatomy
On the basis of morphology (outer
appearance) and anatomy (inner structure),
several evidences have been described as
follows
Homologous Organs
● The organs which are similar in basic
structure and origin but dissimilar in
function are called homologous organs,
e.g., wings of bat, cat’s paw, front foot of
horse, human’s hand and wings of birds.
● These show divergent evolution.
Analogous Organs
(Homoplastic)
● The organs which are similar in shape and
function but dissimilar in their origin and
development. e.g., wings of insects, birds
and bats, eyes of octopus and mammals.
● They show convergent evolution.
Vestigial Organs
● These are degenerate, non-functional
organs which were functional earlier.
● Human body has been described to possess
about 90 vestigial organs. Some of these
are muscles of ear pinna, canine teeth and
third molar teeth, body hairs, vermiform
appendix, nictitating membrane of eye,
caudal vertebral (coccyx or tail bone) etc.
Atavism or Reversion
It is the sudden reappearance of some
ancestral features. Appearance of thick body
hair, large canines, monstral face, short
temporary tails, extra nipples etc are
examples of atavism.
Evidence from Connecting
Links
Connecting link is one which exhibit
characteristics of more than one groups.

THEORIES OF
EVOLUTION
Lamarckism (1809)
● Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck gave the idea that
an organism can pass on characteristics that it
acquired during its lifetime to its offspring
(also known as heritability of acquired
characteristics).
● Lamarck’s theory of evolution was published
in Philosophie Zoologique and had four
propositions, viz
1. Living organisms and its parts tend to
increase in size due to internal force of life.
2. Formation of new organs is the result of a
new need and new involvement.
3. Individuals lose characteristics that they do
not require (or use) and develop
characteristics that are useful.
4. Individuals inherit the traits of their
ancestors.
Darwinism (1859)
● Darwin’s theory of evolution was Origin of
Species by Natural Selection.
● The theory consists of five propositions, they
are
1. Overproduction or enormous fertility
2. Struggle for existence
3. Variation and heredity
4. Survival of the fittest or natural selection
5. Origin of species.
Mutation Theory
● Hugo de Vries proposed the theory
of mutation, while working on
Oenothera lamarckiana plant.
● Mutations are discontinuous
variations.
● Mutations are due to changes in
chromosomes, genes and DNA.
● These may or may not be inherited.
Synthetic Theory
According to it, the five basic factors
are
1. Gene mutation
2. Changes in chromosome
structure and number
3. Genetic recombination
4. Natural selection
5. Reproductive isolation
First three factors are responsible for
genetic variablity.
■ Devonian period is known as Age of
fishes.
■ Mesozoic era is known as Age of
Reptiles.
■ Coenozoic era is known as Age of
Mammals.
Classification of
Organisms
In Linnaeus time, a two kingdom
system of classification with Plantae
and Animalia kingdom was developed.
The system did not distinguish
between the eukaryotes and
prokaryotes, unicellular and
multicellular and photosynthetic
organisms.
Five Kingdom System
RH Whittaker (1969) proposed a five
kingdom classification. The kingdom
named were Monera, Protista, Fungi,
Plantae and Animalia.
Classification of
Animalia Kingdom
Storer and Usinger classified
animals into following phylums
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 421
Phylum–Protozoa
● These are unicellular animals, i.e., made
up of only one cell.
● In these, all the metabolic activity like
digestion, respiration, excretion and
reproduction takes place in unicellular
body.
● Respiration and excretion take place
through diffusion.
e.g., Amoeba, Plasmodium, Euglena etc.
Phylum–Porifera
● These are found in marine water and have
porous body. The pores are called ostia.
These are multicellular animals.
● Their skeleton is made up of minute
calcareous or siliceous spicules.
e.g., Sycon, Sponge etc.
Phylum–Coelenterata
● These are aquatic animals, have thread-like
structures called tentacles around the
mouth which help in holding the food.
● They have specialised cnidoblast cell to
help in catching the food.
● Phenomenon of polymorphism (many
forms) and metagenesis (alternation of
generation) are associated with
coelentrates.
e.g., Hydra, Jelly fish, Sea Anemone etc.
● Hydra has a tendency of regeneration of
body organs.
Phylum– Platyhelminthes
● Animals of this phylum have
alimentary canal with single opening,
anus is absent.
● Excretion takes place by flame cells.
● There is no skeletal system such as,
respiratory system, circulatory system
etc.
● These are hermaphrodite animals
(males are not separated from
females).
e.g., Planaria, Liver fluke, Tape worm
etc.
Phylum–Aschelminthes
● These are long, cylindrical,
unsegmented worms.
● Their alimentary canal is complete in
which mouth and anus both are
present.
● There is no circulatory and respiratory
system but nervous system is
developed. Excretion takes place
through protonephridia.
● They are unisexual.
● Most forms are parasitic but some are
free living in soil and water.
e.g., Ascaris, Threadworm, etc.
¡ Threadworm is found mainly in the
anus of child. Due to which children
feel itching and often vomits. Some
children urinate on the bed at night.

which contain proper bone like
structures (ossicles).
e.g., Star fish, Sea urchin, Sea cucumber
etc.
Phylum-Chordata
● They have notochord. A dorsal hollow
tubular nerve cord and paired
pharyngeal gill slits at some stage of their
life span.
● In advanced forms, notochord changes
to vertebral column, nerve cord develops
to brain and spinal cord and pharyngeal
gill slits to structures of jaw attachment.
● This phylum is sub-divided into two
sub-phylum, i.e., Protochordata and
Vertebrata.
Some main classes of phylum– Chordata
are as follows
Pisces

(except in camel and llama).
● Skin of mammals contains hair.
● External ear is present.
Mammalia is divided into three
sub-classes
● Prototheria It lays eggs, e.g.,
Echidna.
● Metatheria It bears the immature
child, e.g., Kangaroo.
● Eutheria It bears the well developed
child, e.g., Humans.
They give birth to young ones, but
Echidna and Platypus are the egg
laying mammals.
SYSTEMS OF
HUMAN BODY
Integumentary System
The human skin (integumentary) is
composed of a minimum of three major
layers of tissue, the epidermis, dermis
and hypodermis.
Epidermis
The top layer of skin is made up of
epithelial cells and does not contain
blood vessels.
Dermis
● It gives elasticity to the integument,
allowing stretching and conferring
flexibility, while also resisting
distortions, wrinkling and sagging.
● Nails grow 1 mm per week on an
average.
● Protein, keratin stiffens epidermal
tissue to form finger nails.
Hypodermis
● It is made up of adipose tissue.
It performs several important functions
1. Protect against invasion by
infectious organisms.
2. Protect the body from dehydration.
3. Maintain homeostasis.
4. Act as a receptor for touch, pressure,
pain, heat and cold.
5. Protect the body against sunburns by
secreting melanin.
6. Generate vitamin-D through
exposure to ultraviolet light.
7. Store water, fat, glucose and
vitamin-D.
424 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Animal Nutrition and
Digestion
Animals are not able to synthesise their
own food, therefore they obtain it from
outside environment for their nutritional
requirements.
Mineral Nutrients
● These are metals, non-metals and their
salts other than the four
elements—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
and oxygen and constitute about 4% of
total body weight.
● Milk, eggs, meat, fruit, food, vegetables
etc are the sources of minerals.
Minerals are of two types
1. Macronutrients These are required in
large amount, e.g., calcium (Ca),
phosphorus (P), potassium (K) etc.
2. Micronutrients These are required in
very small amount (less than 1 g), e.g.,
iodine (I), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) etc.

water. Two-third of water exists inside
cells, the other one-third is outside the
cells in tissue fluid and blood plasma. It is
essential for digestion, transportation,
excretion and to regulate body
temperature.
Many factors affects the health of human
body. One of them is adulteration.
Food Adulteration
Addition of undesirable, cheap and
harmful substances in the food is called
food adulteration.
Indian Standards Institution (ISI) Mark
and Agmark (Agricultural marketing) are
given by the Bureau of Indian Standards
after testing the purity and quality of
material and food respectively.

HUMAN DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM
The human digestive system consists of
alimentary canal and digestive glands.
The alimentary canal consists of mouth,
(having teeth and tongue) oesophagus,
stomach, small intestine and large
intestine.
Teeth
● With the help of teeth the food is
chewed. Teeth are of four types
Incisors (for cutting)
Canines (for tearing)
Premolars (for chewing)
Molars (for chewing and grinding)
● The number of teeth are different in
different animals. These are represented
by dental formula as
I C Pm M – Upper half jaw
I C Pm M – Lower half jaw
Where, I − Incisors, C − Canines,
Pm − Premolars and M − Molars.
● Premolars and molars are called cheek
teeth. Milk teeth do not include molar
teeth.
● In humans, first teeth come in between
6 and 8 months. By the age of 6, milk
teeth are gradually replaced by permanent
teeth.
● Hardest part in the body is tooth enamel.
● In elephants, the tusks are the incisors of
upper jaw.
● Maximum number of teeth are present in
horse and pig.

Tongue
● Saliva, secreted by the salivary glands, is
mixed with the chewed food by the
tongue.
● Tongue also contains taste buds due to
which we sense bitter, sour, salty or sweet
taste.

Functions of the
Digestive System
Splitting of complex food materials into
simpler molecules by hydrolysis so that
they can be easily absorbed by the
intestine is the main function of
digestive system.
● Man and other animals have holozoic
nutrition i.e., solid form of food.
Complete digestion process takes place in
following four steps
Ingestion of Food
● Ingestion takes place in buccal cavity.
● Saliva lubricates the food and binds the food
particles together to form bolus.
● Salivary gland have starch spitting enzyme
ptyalin.
● Parotid gland is the largest salivary gland.
Digestion of Food
Digestion in Mouth
In mouth, salivary amylase acts on
starch.
Starch
(Complex form)
Maltose
(Simple
Ptyalin
→
form)
Digestion in Stomach
● The food passes down through the
oesophagus into stomach.
● Now food is mixed with gastric juice
and hydrochloric acid which
disinfect the food and creates acidic
medium.
● Pepsin digests proteins and converts
them into peptones.
● Rennin convert milk into curd.
● Digested food now is called chyme.
Digestion in Duodenum
● Chyme moves to duodenum.
● Food is mixed with bile (liver) to breakdown
fats into smaller globules.
● Trypsin acts upon proteins and break them
into polypeptides. Amylase converts starch
into simple sugar.
● Lipase convert fats into fatty acids and
glycerol.
Digestion in Intestine
● Food passes into ileum and mixes with
intestinal juice, where
¡ Maltase converts maltose into glucose
¡ Lactase converts lactose into glucose
and galactose
¡ Sucrase converts sucrose into glucose and
fructose
¡ Trypsin digests the peptides into amino
acids

Absorption and Assimilation of
Digested Food
● Ileum’s internal surface has finger-like
folds called villi.
● It helps in absorption of food.
● Intestinal juice is alkaline in nature.
● pH of saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic
juice and intestinal juice is respectively
6.8, 2.0, 7.0 and 8.5.
Ejection of Unwanted Food
● Digested food passes into large intestine.
● Large intestine cannot absorb food, but
absorbs much of the water.
● The remaining semi solid waste is called
faeces and is passed into rectum.
● It is expelled out through anus.
Roughage
● Roughage is another term for dietary
fibres e.g., Natural food, dalia etc.
● It does not provide energy but only helps
in retaining water in the body.
SOME DIGESTIVE
GLANDS
Liver
● It is the largest gland of the human body
and secretes bile juice, which is stored in
gall bladder.
● It regulates the quantity of glucose in the
blood by converting extra glucose (if any)
into glycogen or glycogen (during
deficiency of glucose) is converted into
glucose.
● It destroys dead RBC and regulates body
temperature. It converts excess of amino
acid into ammonia (which is converted
into urea by Ornithine cycle). Urea
comes out from the body through kidney.
● If there is any obstruction in bile duct,
liver cells stop taking bilirubin from the
blood, consequently it spreads
throughout the body which is called
jaundice.
● Liver is an important body organ in
investigation of a person’s death that has
been due to poison in food.
Pancreas
● It is the second-largest gland of the
human body and contains islets of
Langerhans and exocrine part secreting
enzymes for carbohydrate, protein and
nucleic acid digestion.
● The most common is the β-cells, which
secretes insulin, a hormone deficiency
of which causes diabetes melitus.
● Excess of insulin causes hypoglyaemia,
in which one loses the reproducing
capacity and vision.
Intestinal Glands
Crypts of Lieberkuhn and Brunner’s
glands are intestinal glands and secrete
intestinal juice which is alkaline in nature.
RESPIRATORY
SYSTEM
Respiration is a catabolic process in
which the respired oxygen is used in the
oxidation of food resulting in the release of
energy. It is brought about by respiratory
organs.

Human Respiratory System
● Overall passage of air in humans is as
follows:
Nostrils → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea
→ Bronchi → Bronchioles → Alveoli →
Cells→ Blood.
● The human respiratory system is shown
in the following diagram.
Types of Respiration
Aerobic Respiration
● The respiration taking place in the
presence of oxygen is known as aerobic
respiration.
● This respiratory oxygen oxidises the
substance into carbon dioxide, water
and energy, as follows
Glucose + O2 →Carbon dioxide
+ Water + Energy.
● In this process, each glucose molecule is
converted into two molecules of pyruvic
acid by the process, called glycolysis. It
takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell.
The pyruvic acid formed, releases energy
with the formation of carbon dioxide and
water (in Kreb’s cycle which occur in
mitochondria).
Anaerobic Respiration
● The respiration taking place in the
absence of oxygen is known as
anaerobic respiration.
● It is found in endoparasites like
roundworm. In this process, the
respiratory substances are incompletely
oxidised to carbon dioxide and alcohol.
Glucose →
yeast
Carbon dioxide +
ethyl alcohol
muscles +Energy (in plants)
Glucose → Lactic acid
+ Energy (in animals)
PHASES OF AEROBIC
RESPIRATION
External Respiration
(Breathing or Ventilation of
Lungs)
● It involves inspiration and expiration of
air.
● Inspiration is the process of intake of air.
During inspiration, muscles of the
diaphragm contract and diaphragm
flattens.
● The lower ribs are raised upward and
outwards. The chest cavity enlarges, the
air pressure in the lungs gets decreased
and air rushes into the lungs.
● Expiration is breathing out of air. During
expiration, relaxation of muscles of the
ribs and diaphragm takes place.
● Diaphragm again become dome-shaped.
Chest cavity is reduced and air is
forced outwards through nose and
trachea.
● Breathing rate in humans is 18 20 - times
per min.
● The exchange of gases, i.e., oxygen and
carbon dioxide takes place due to the
difference in their partial pressures.
Internal Respiration
(Oxidation of Food)
● It is a complex process in which food is
broken down to release energy.
● Transportation of oxygen takes place by
haemoglobin of blood. Whereas
transportation of only 10-20% carbon
dioxide takes place by haemoglobin of
blood.
● Approximately 400 ml water is lost
through breathing everyday.

Human Respiratory System
■ Respiration being a catalytic process, also
reduces the weight of the body.
■ Larynx or voice box or Adam’s apple
produces sound. It has a small flap of
cartilage called the epiglottis, which
prevents the food from entering the trachea.
■ Purring sound in cats is due to the
vibration of false vocal cord.
■
In hippopotamus, true vocal cord is absent.
■ Total Lung Capacity (TLC) = 6000 mL
■ Residual Volume (RV) = 1200 mL
■ Tidal Volume (TV) = 500-600 ml
CIRCULATORY
SYSTEM
● It is a transport system that supplies the
useful material and removes the waste
from the body cells.
It consists of heart, blood vessels and
blood.
HEART
● Heart is a thick, muscular, contractile,
automatic pumping organ of blood
vascular system.
● The chamber which receives the blood
from body tissues are called auricles and
the chambers of heart which pump blood
to body tissues are called ventricles.
● There is a thin two layered sac around
the heart known as pericardium, filled
with a watery fluid called pericardial
fluid, which allows frictionless
movements of heart and protects it from
mechanical shocks.
● Fishes have only two-chambered heart
(one auricle and one ventricle).
● In amphibians, heart is
three-chambered.
● In crocodile, birds and mammals, the
heart is divided into four chambers (two
auricles and two ventricles).
● Reptilian heart is structurally threechambered but is functionally fourchambered (i.e., incomplete fourchambered) except in crocodile.
● A new born baby’s heart weight is about
20 g.
● The average weight of heart in men
is 280-340 g, while in women is
230-280 g.

Human Heart
Angina pectoris Pain in heart muscles, appearing as chest pain. It is caused due to
obstruction in coronary artery.
Tachycardia Increased rate of heartbeat.
Bradycardia Decreased rate of heartbeat.
Heart attack Breathlessness, palpitations, pain in the chest, unconsciousness
appear suddenly (Nitroglycerine is used for the treatment).
Heart block When heart beat is not passed to the ventricles properly. This is the
defect of conducting system of the heart.
Coronary thrombosis Due to the formation of clot in coronary artery.
Myocardial infarction It is the death of a part of heart muscle following cessation of blood
supply to it. It is acute heart attack.
● The circulation of blood through the whole
body can be shown as
● To pump out blood, the heart chamber
undergoes alternate contraction called
systole and relaxation called diastole. The
regular sequence of these systole and
diastole causes the heart sound Lub and
Dub.
● Arteries carry pure blood from the heart
while veins carry impure blood to the heart.
● Human heart beat is myogenic in nature,
i.e., initiated by a patch of modified heart
muscles itself without requiring an external
stimulation. This patch is called SA node
(sino-auricular node) or pacemaker.
● When SA-node becomes defective, i.e., it
does not generate cardiac impulses, it can
be cured by surgical grafting of an artificial
pacemaker (an electric device) in the chest
of the patient. It stimulate the heart
electrically at regular intervals.
● The normal rate of heartbeat at rest is
about 70-72 times per minute. In a newly
born baby, heartbeat rate is about 140 per
minute.
● During heavy exercise it may be high as
170-200 times per minute.
BLOOD
● Blood is a fluid connective tissue and
composed of blood corpuscles, plasma and
platelets.
● It is slightly alkaline is nature (pH 7.4).
● Its volume in an adult is 5.8 L.
● The oxygenated or pure blood is bright red
while the deoxygenated blood is purple
coloured (Darker shade of red).
● People who live at high altitudes have more
blood than those who live in low regions.
This extra blood supplies additional
oxygen to body cells.
● During blood clotting fibrinogen
changes into fibrin by thrombin
which is obtained from thromboplastin in the presence of Ca2+.
● The haemoglobin content of adult
female varies from 13.5-14.5%
whereas in adult male its amount
varies from 14.5-15.5% Haemoglobin
count is highest in the foetus and is
about 23 g per 100 mL of blood at
birth.
Blood Vessels
Blood vessels are of three types
Arteries
● These are thick walled blood vessels
which carry the blood away from the
heart to various body parts. These are
deep seated in the body and have no
valves in them.
● These carry oxygenated blood except
the pulmonary artery which carries
deoxygenated blood to the lungs. In
arteries, blood flows at a high
pressure and a higher speed.
Veins
● These are thin walled blood vessels
and carry blood away from various
body parts towards the heart. These
have valves in them to prevent
back flow of blood in them. Blood
flows at low pressure and at a lower
speed.
● These carry deoxygenated blood
except the pulmonary vein which
carries oxygenated blood to the heart.
Capillaries
● These are the thinnest blood vessels
and connect arteries to the veins.
● These help in exchange of materials
like the nutrients, gases, waste
products etc., between blood and
cells.

Blood Cells
Erythrocytes (RBCs)
● Red blood cells contain the blood’s haemoglobin
and distribute oxygen.
● RBCs are the most abundant cells.
● Mature red blood cells lack a
nucleus and organelles in
mammals. However, in camel
and llama it is nucleated.
● One RBC contains about 280
haemoglobin molecules.
Leukocytes (WBCs)
These are part of the body’s
immune system; they destroy and
remove old or aberrant cells and
cellular debris, as well as attack
infectious agents and foreign
substances. These are much less
in number than RBCs (1 : 600).
Thrombocytes
(Platelets)
It is responsible for blood clotting
(coagulation). It changes
fibrinogen into fibrin.
Blood Pressure (BP)
● The pressure created by the blood on the walls of
the blood vessels due to the repeated pumping of
heart is called blood pressure. It is measured by
sphygmomanometer.
● It can be felt at certain places in our body viz,
wrist of the hands etc.
● Blood pressure is recorded as systolic/diastolic.
Blood pressure in a normal person is 120 80/
mmHg. Factors affecting blood pressure are age,
cardiac output, total peripheral resistance etc.
● If a person has persistent high
blood pressure then it is called
hypertension and persistent
high blood pressure is 150/90
mm Hg. Factors responsible are
over eating, fear, worry, anxiety,
sorrow etc. Hypotension is
condition of low blood pressure,
i.e., persistent 100/50 mm Hg.
● Electrocardiograph (ECG) is
used to check proper working of
heart by using electrodes.
432 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Plasma Lymph
It contains 92% water, 8% blood plasma
proteins and trace amounts of other materials
Lymph contains a variety of substances
including proteins, salts, glucose, fats, water
and WBCs.
It is cell free part of blood, contain salts,
considerable amount of proteins as well as
more or less all constituents of body.
It is modified tissue fluid, contains cells like
lymphocyte and monocytes, salt and small
amount of proteins. It is colourless.
It flows within blood vessels. It flows within lymphatic vessels.
It takes part in nutrition, excretion, respiration,
etc., by transporting various materials and helps
in the defence mechanism of the body by
producing antibodies.
It supplies nutrition to tissue devoid of blood
supply, takes part in fat absorption and
defence mechanism of the body.
It can coagulate because it contains fibrinogen
and prothrombin.
It can coagulate but very slowly because it
contains these two in small quantities.
SKELETAL SYSTEM
The human skeleton consists of both fused
and individual bones supported and
supplemented by ligaments, tendons,
muscles and cartilage.
It is divided into two parts
Axial Skeleton (80 Bones)
● It includes skull, vertebral column and
bones of chest (ribs and sternum).
● Vertebral column is responsible for the
upright position of the human body.
● Most of the body weight is located at the
back of the vertebral column. It provides
flexibility to the neck and protection to
spinal cord.
Appendicular
Skeleton (126 Bones)
Their function is to make locomotion
possible and to protect the major organs of
locomotion, digestion, excretion and
reproduction.

● Tendons join the muscles and bones.
● The muscles which join bone to bone are
called ligaments.
Diseases of Skeletal System
● Hard tissue deposits over articular
cartilage along with higher secretion of
synovial fluid causing pain and stiffness
lead to rheumatoid arthritis. (An auto
immune disease).
● Tearing of articular cartilage and
development of bony lumps at places
causing pain, stiffness and permanent
bending lead to osteoarthritis.
● Osteoporosis is loss of bone density due
to excessive absorption of calcium and
phosphorus from the bone.
● Osteopetrosis is a hereditary disease
marked by abnormally dense bone and by
the common occurrence of fractures of
affected bone.
● Birds have spongy bones with air filled
spaces, called pneumatic bones.
● Rigor mortis is the state of body
stiffening after death.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 433
● Chronic fatigue is the inability of a
muscle to contract due to depletion
of its chemicals and lactic acid
accumulation by repeated contraction.
A completely fatigued muscle refuses to
respond to nervous stimuli.
Muscular System
● Human body has about 639 types of
muscles.
● Muscles specialised to contraction are
of three types, i.e., striated, unstriated
and cardiac.
● Striated muscles Also called skeletal
muscles or voluntary muscles. They are
present in limbs, tongue, pharynx etc.
● Unstriated muscles These are
involuntary muscles and present in
urinary bladder, in walls of large blood
vessels and alimentary canal.
● Cardiac muscles They are involuntary,
striated and non-fatigued fibres which
are found in the wall of heart, where
they form myocardium. They generate
their own wave of excitation.
EXCRETORY SYSTEM
The process of removal of nitrogenous
wastes from the body is called excretion.
The organs of excretion are called
excretory organs.
Excretory Organ Animal
Contractile vacuole Amoeba
Flame cells/solenocytes Tapeworm
Renette cell Ascaris
Nephridia Earthworm
Malpighian tubules Cockroach
Coxal glands Scorpion
Green glands Prawn
Excretory Products
Ammonotelic Animals
These animal excrete nitrogen in the
form of ammonia, e.g., aquatic
invertebrates Amoeba, Hydra, Prawn,
Pila, and freshwater fishes, bony fishes,
Frog’s tadpole.
Ureotelic Animals
They excrete nitrogen in the form of urea,
e.g., mammal (man), frogs, toads, other
amphibians and cartilaginous fishes like
sharks.
Uricotelic Animals
They excrete the nitrogenous wastes in the
form of uric acid, e.g., Reptiles, snakes,
lizards, crocodiles and birds.
Human Excretory System
The human excretory system includes—the
kidneys (two), ureters (two), urinary bladder
(one) and urethra (one).
Kidney
● It is bean-shaped, chocolate brown organ
lying in the abdomen, one on each side of
the vertebral column just below the
diaphragm.
● The left kidney is placed a little higher
than the right kidney (but reverse in
rabbit).
● These form the urine and controls
osmotic pressure within the organism with
respect to external environment.
● Nephrons are the functional and
structural unit of kidney. Each nephron is
made up of Bowman’s capsule and renal
tubule. Renal tubule is made up of
Proximal Convolutid Tubule (PCT),
Henle’s loop, Distal Convoluted Tubule
(DCT) and Collecting Tubule (CT).
Ureters
These bring the urine downward and open
into urinary bladder.
Urinary Bladder
● It temporarily stores the urine.
● It can hold about 0.5-1.0 L of urine.
● It is absent in birds. In both reptiles and
birds, ureters and rectum, opens into a
common sac called cloaca.
Urethra
● It is a muscular and tubular structure
which extends from neck of bladder to
outside. In females, this tube is small and
serves as a passage of urine only.
● In males, it is long and functions as a
common passage for urine and spermatic
fluids.
434 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Urine
● It is a pale yellow coloured fluid due to
presence of urochrome pigment.
● It is acidic in nature (pH 6.0) and is slightly
heavier than water.
● It has a faint aromatic odour due to urinoid.
Daily urine output in normal adult is
1.5-1.8 L.
● Chemical composition of urine : water is
95-96%, urea is 2% and some other substance
like uric acid, creatinine, etc., are 2-3%.
● The urine on standing gives a pungent smell.
It is due to conversion of urea into ammonia
by bacteria.
● Haemodialysis is the process of removal of
excesss urea from the blood of patient using
artificial kidney.
● Kidney stone are generally calcium oxalate
crystals.
NERVOUS SYSTEM
● The nervous system provides the fastest
means of communication within the body so
that suitable response to stimuli can be made
at once.
● Nervous system is found only in animals and
absent in plants.
● In most animals, the nervous system consists
of two parts—central and peripheral nervous
system.
Central Nervous
System (CNS)
Brain
● Brain lies in the cranium of skull.
● Cerebrospinal fluid is present in brain and
spinal cord.
The functions of brain parts are as
follows
Forebrain
● Cerebrum leads to consciousness,
storage of memory having
information.
● Thalamus deals with touch, visual
system, sleep and wakefulness.
● Hypothalamus deals with water
balance in body, behavioral patterns
of sex, sleep, stress emotions etc. It
also regulates pituitary hormones
and metabolism of fat,
carbohydrate water and maintain
body temperature (homeostasis).
Midbrain
It deals with visual analysis, auditory
etc.
Broca’s area is present in brain and
is related with speech production, while
Wernick’s area of brain is related
with understanding of speech.
Hindbrain
● Cerebellum controls coordination
of accurate movements and
balancing.
● Medulla oblongata is long
connecting part of brain to spinal
cord. It deals with control of heart
beats, blood vessels, breathing,
salivary secretion and mostly reflex
and involuntary (uncontrolled)
movements.
Nobel Prize in Medicine 2016
The Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine 2016 was awarded to
Yoshinori Ohsumi “for his discoveries of
mechanisms for autophagy.
The word ‘autophagy’ originates from
the Greek words auto, meaning ‘self and
phageil meaning to ‘eat’. It is an
evolutionarily conserved process in
which the eukaryotic cell can recycle
part of its own content.

heat, knee jerk reflex etc.
Acquired reflex action is also called
conditioned reflex as dependent on past
experience, training and learning.
It was first demonstrated by Ivan Petrovich
Pavlov e.g. learning, dancing, cycling,
swimming, singing and driving etc are
controlled by spinal chord. It is under
cerebral control during learning.
Peripheral Nervous
System (PNS)
● It is a collective term for the nervous
system structures that do not lie within
the CNS.
● It is composed of cranial and spinal
nerves. There are 10 pairs of cranial
nerves in fishes and amphibians and
12 pairs in rest of the higher chordates.
● There are 10 pairs of spinal nerves
found in fishes and amphibians and
31 pairs in humans.
● The PNS is divided into two divisions:
Somatic Nervous System (SNS) and
Autonomous Nervous System (ANS).
● It is a part of peripheral nervous system
that relays impulses from the CNS to
skeletal muscles.
Autonomous Nervous
System (ANS)
It is also a part of peripheral nervous
system that transmits impulses from the
CNS to involuntary organs and smooth
muscles of the body. Autonomic nervous
system consists of two divisions
1. Sympathetic Nervous System
increases defence system of body
against adverse conditions. It is active
in stress condition, e.g., pain, fear and
anger.
2. Parasympathetic Nervous System
provides relaxation, comfort, pleasure
at the time of rest. It helps in the
restoration and conservation of
energy.
● Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test
that measures and records the electrical
activity of our brain.
SENSE ORGANS
Eye
Eyes are the sensitive detectors of light. The
human eye can distinguish about 10 million
colours. It consists of three parts
Sclerotic Layer
It is the outermost, bony layer, which
includes
● Cornea the clear, dome-shaped tissue,
covering the front of the eye.
● Conjunctiva, the continuation of upper
eyelid.
Choroid Layer
It is the middle layer and consists of
1. Pupil is the black hole in the centre
of the iris. It changes size as the
amount of light changes.
2. Ciliary muscles regulates the lens
curvature.
3. Iris is the coloured part of the eye. It
controls the amount of light that enters
the eye by changing the size of the
pupil.
4. Lens is a biconvex transparent
circular solid located just behind the
iris. It focuses light onto the retina.
Retina
● Light sensitive tissue that lies at the
back of the eye. It contains millions of
photoreceptors (rods and cones) that
convert light rays into electrical impulses
that are relayed to the brain via the optic
nerve.
● The image formed on retina is real and
inverted.

The Eye
● Rods are highly sensitive to dim light and
contain a reddish purple pigment called
rhodopsin. Night vision involves mostly rods
(not cones).
● Cones are sensitive to bright light, hence
differentiate the colours.
● The fovea centralis is the area of sharpest
vision due to high concentration of cones.
● The blind spot (optic disc) has no rods and
cone cells, hence no image is form in this
region.
Eye Defects
Nearsightedness (Myopia)
● A condition in which nearby objects are seen
more clearly than distant objects because
light is focused in front of the retina, not on it.
It can be corrected by using concave glasses.
Farsightedness (Hypermetropia)
● A condition in which distant objects are seen
more clearly than nearby objects because light
is focused behind the retina, not on it.
● It can be corrected by using convex glasses.
Astigmatism
● A condition in which the lens is warped,
causing images not to focus properly on the
retina.
● The cylindrical glass can correct the defect.
● Colour blindness also called Daltonism is
caused due to deficiency of cones. While
night blindness is due to deficiency of
rhodopsin in rods.
● Retina of Owl contains only rods while fowl
contains only cones.
● The eyes of carnivores like cat, dog, iron sea
etc, glow in night due to tapetum lucidum.
Eyes are most sensitive to yellow green
colour. Bees can see ultraviolet light.
Presbyopia
● It is a reduction in pupil size and the loss of
accommodation or focusing capability with
age, leading to a substantial decrease in light
received at the retina.
● Bifocal lens can correct the defect.
● Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of
conjunctiva by bacteria.

ear (bony and membranous
labyrinth).
● Hearing is controlled by auditory
area of temporal lobe of cerebral
cortex.
● Human ear can receive the sound
ranging between 60-80 decibel.
● Human ear is sensitive to sounds
frequency 50-20,000 cycles/sec.
● Defects of ear are : Otalgia ear,

(Acute infection of middle ear)
Labyrithine disease (malfunction
of inner ear).
Nose
● Nose is a sense organ for smell or
olfaction. It contains
1. Olfactory cells which are more
chemosensitive than taste cells.
2. Olfactory stimuli such as,
chloroform and ammonia are
irritating and can cause tearing.
● Dogs have an acute olfactory sense.
They can trace people because they
can distinguish between the odours
of different persons.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 437
REPRODUCTIVE
SYSTEM
● The process by which new individuals are
produced from their parents is called
reproduction and the organs which are
used for this process, collectively
constitute the reproductive system.
● Reproduction is of two types, i.e., asexual
and sexual.
● In asexual reproduction, only one parent
is involved and sex cells are not involved.
● In sexual reproduction, two parents are
involved and formation and fusion of
gametes takes place.

Female Reproductive System
● After maturity the ovary releases an
ovum (egg cell) after every 28 days.
● The connection between developing
embryo and mother is made by
placenta. It supplies blood, organic and
inorganic nutrients, hormones,
antibodies etc.
● The embryo develops for nine months in
uterus. It is called gestation period.
● Child is delivered after its development
and mother produces milk to nourish
the child (lactation).
● The first milk which comes out from the
mother’s mammary gland just after
child birth is called colostrum.
● This milk is rich in protein, antibodies
which imparts immunity to new born
baby.
Menstrual Cycle
● Reproductive period of a human female
extends from puberty (10-14 years) to
menopause (40-50 years).
● The release of the first menstrual flow or
period is called menarche.
● Menarche marks the onset of
reproductive life and onset of puberty in
females.
● Menopause is stopping of ovulation and
menses. It normally occurs between the
age of 45 to 55. This stage onwards,
woman lose the ability to reproduce.
● The periodic vaginal bleeding during
menstrual cycle is called menstruation.
● On an average menstural cycle is
completed in 28 days.
● It is absent during pregnancy, may be
suppressed during lactation and
permanently stops at menopause. About
13 mature eggs are released from two
ovaries of female in a year.
● Menstrual cycle is controlled by FSH,
LH, oestrogen and progesterone
hormones.
Birth Control Methods or
Contraception Methods
● The prevention of union of sperm and
ovum is known as contraception. The
various methods used for it are
diaphragm, contraceptive pills,
tubectomy, vesectomy, copper-T etc.
● Amniocentesis or amniotic fluid test is
technique of finding out sex and disorder
of foetus.

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
● It includes endocrine or ductless glands.
Their secretion is known as hormones.
● Different types of hormones are
● Steroids, e.g., oestradiol, testosterone,
androsterone, aldosterone, cortisol and
cortisone.
● Peptides, e.g., insulin, glucagon,
pituitary hormones, parathormone and
relaxin.
● Amino acid derivatives, e.g., adrenaline,
noradrenaline and thyroid hormones.
Various glands are:
Hypothalamus
It is a part of forebrain and regulates the
pituitary glands and maintains body
temperature (homeostasis).
Pituitary Gland or
Hypophysis
● It governs other endocrine glands like
thyroid, adrenal and gonads.
● Pituitary gland is also known as master
gland.
Thyroid Gland
● It is the largest endocrine gland and
located in neck region.
● It is the ‘pace setter’ of the endocrine
system. It secretes
1. Thyroxine, which regulates BMR
(Basal Metabolic Rate), physical,
mental and sexual development.
2. Thyrocalcitonin secreted by the
C-cells and regulates the calcium
homeostasis (lowers calcium level).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 439
Pancreas
It is both an exocrine and endocrine gland.
The islet of Langerhans (endocrine) have
three major types of cells
1. Alpha-Cells secretes glucagon hormone
which increases blood sugar level.
2. Beta-Cells secretes insulin, which
decreases the amount of sugar in the
blood.
3. Delta-Cells secretes somatostatin
which is an anti-growth factor.
Adrenal Gland
● It is also known as emergency gland.
(a) Cortex (outer layer)
(b) Medulla (inner layer) It secretes two
important hormones— Epinephrine or
adrenaline and nor-epinephrine or
noradrenaline
● It increases the blood glucose level, blood
pressure and cardiac output.
Pineal Gland
● It is situated in the brain and also known
as clockwork gland.
● It regulates the ovaries and has an effect
on the biological rhythm.
GONADS
These secrete steroid hormones.
Ovarian Hormones
(Oestrogens)
It helps in the development of primary and
secondary sexual characters (oestradiol,
oestriol and estrogen). Hypersecretion of
androgenic steroids in female results in
stopping of menstruation, hairs on face and
breasts.
Testicular Hormones
(Androgens)
These are produced by Leydig cells of
testes.It stimulate growth, maturation and
maintenance of male gonads and
development of secondary sexual characters,
e.g., testosterone, androsterone etc.
HEALTH
Health is the functional or metabolic
efficiency of a living being. In human, it is
the general condition of a person’s mind,
body and spirit, usual meaning, to be free
from illness, injury or pain.
DISEASES
It is a condition of the body or its part in
which functions are disturbed. The
diseases may be broadly classified into
two types, i.e., congenital and acquired.
Congenital Diseases
These are anatomical or physiological
abnormalities present from birth.
They may be caused by
● A single gene mutation (alkaptonuria,
phenylketonuria, albinism, sickle-cell
anaemia, haemophilia and colour
blindness).
● Chromosomal aberrations (Down’s
syndrome, Klinefelter’s syndrome and
Turner’s syndrome).
● Environmental factors (cleft palate
and harelip). Unlike the gene and
chromosome induced congenital
defects, environmentally caused
abnormalities are not transmitted to the
children.
Acquired Diseases
These diseases develop after birth.
They are further of two types, i.e.,
communicable and non-communicable.
1. Communicable (infectious)
diseases are caused by pathogenic
micro-organisms, such as bacteria,
viruses, parasites or fungi; the
diseases can be spread, directly or
indirectly, from one person to
another. Infectious diseases, are also
known as transmissible diseases.
2. Non-communicable (noninfectious) diseases are not passed
by organisms among people, but
come from genetic or lifestyle
factors.
440 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
COMMUNICABLE
DISEASES
These are the diseases which may pass or
carried from one human or animal to
other.
Communicable diseases are illness caused
by germs such as bacteria, viruses and
spread by an infected person, animals or
object to other persons.
Viral Diseases
Viruses are parasitic and causes a number
of diseases.
Bird Flu( ) H N5 1
Bird flu (Avian influenza) is a disease
caused by an influenza virus-A, that
primarily affect birds.
The following persons may be on higher risk
for developing the bird flu
● Farmers and others, who work with
poultry.
● Travellers, visiting affected countries.
● Those who have touched an infected
bird.
● Those who eat raw or undercooked
poultry meat, eggs from infected birds.
Symptoms
Fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and
eye infection (conjunctivitis).
Treatment
Treatment with the antiviral medication
oseltamivir (tamiflu) or zanamivir (relenza)
may make the disease less severe.
Oseltamivir may also be prescribed for
persons, who live in the same house as
those diagnosed with avian flu.
Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS)
It is a serious form of pneumonia. It is
caused by a virus that was first identified in
2003. Infection with the SARS virus causes
acute respiratory distress (severe breathing
difficulty) and sometimes death.
Symptoms
Cough usually starts 2-3 days after other
symptoms like Fever, headache and muscle
aches.
Treatment
Antibiotics to treat bacteria that
cause pneumonia. Antiviral medications.
High doses of steroids to reduce swelling in
the lungs. Oxygen, breathing support
(mechanical ventilation) or chest therapy.
Hepatitis
Hepatitis is a swelling and inflammation of
the liver. It is not a condition, but is often
used to refer a viral infection of the liver.
Hepatitis can be caused by
● Immune cells in the body attacking the
liver and causing autoimmune hepatitis.
Infections from viruses (such as
hepatitis-A, B or C), bacteria or
parasites. Liver damage from alcohol,
poisonous mushrooms or other poisons.
● Medications, such as an overdose of
acetaminophen, can cause harm or death
also.
Symptoms
Abdominal pain or distention. Breasts
development in males. Dark urine and
pale or clay coloured stools. Fatigue,
general itching, fever, usually low-grade
jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
and loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and
weight loss.
AIDS
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) is a disease of the human immune
system caused by the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). AIDS was
first recognised by the Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981.
HIV Infection
AIDS is a condition caused by HIV
infection. The condition gradually
destroys the immune system, which
makes it harder for the body to fight
infections.
Transmission
HIV can be spread by the following
● Through sexual contact i.e. oral, vaginal
and anal sex.
● Through blood transfusions, accidental
needle sticks or needle sharing.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 441
● From mother to child: A pregnant woman
can transmit virus to her foetus through
their shared blood circulation or a nursing
mother can pass it to her baby through
breast’s milk.
Test for AIDS
● Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay/
Enzyme Immuno Assay (ELISA/EIA)
● Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay/ Indirect
Fluorescent Antibody Assay (RIP/IFA)
● Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
● Western Blot Confirmatory Test.
NON-COMMUNICABLE
DISEASES
There are various kinds of
non-communicable diseases, which affect
the health of human beings. Some of the
common non- communicable diseases are
Diabetes
Diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too
much glucose (sugar) in the blood. There are
two main types of diabetes
Type 1
Diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t
produce enough insulin to function properly or
the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. This is
known as insulin resistance.
Type 2
Diabetes is far more common than type 1
diabetes, which occurs when the body doesn’t
produce any insulin at all.
Symptoms
Symptoms common to both types of diabetes
include
(i) Feeling very thirsty.
(ii) Urinating frequently, particularly at night.
(iii) Feeling very tired.
(iv) Weight loss and loss of muscle bulk.
Cancer
It is uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in
the body. Some diseases cause emergence of
tumours in body. These are called neoplastic
diseases. This includes from a minor role to a
lethal cancer.
Causes of Cancer
● Cancer is induced by physical,
chemical and biological factors or
agents. These are called carcinogens
or cancer causing agents. Ionising
radiations such as X-rays, γ-rays and
non-ionising radiations such as
ultraviolet (UV) damage the DNA
leading to neoplastic transformation.
● Tobacco smoke contains chemical
carcinogens that causes lung cancer.
Viruses also cause cancer. These are
called oncogenic viruses as they have
genes called viral oncogenes.
Cancer Detection
and Diagnosis
Leukaemia or blood cancer can be
detected based on biopsy and
histopathological studies of the tissue
and blood and bone marrow tests for
increased cell counts. Cancers of
internal organs are detected using
techniques such as Radiography
Computed Tomography (RCT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
442 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Cancer Therapy
■ Cryo Surgery It is the technique of
using extreme rapid cooling that freeze
tissues, thereby destroy them. Rapid
cooling to temperature below freezing
point produces irreversible cell damage
and cell death occurs at 20°C to − 90°C.
■ Proton Therapy It is a type of
particle therapy, which uses a beam of
protons to irradiate diseased tissue,
most often in the treatment of cancer.
■ Radiation Therapy Radiation
therapy is a cancer treatment. Its goal is
to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours.
■ Stem Cell Transplantation Stem
cell transplants can be an effective
treatment for people with certain forms of
cancer, such as leukaemia and lymphoma.
■ Peripheral Blood Stem Cell
Transplantation (PBSCT) It is also
called peripheral stem cell support. This
procedure restore stem cells that has
been destroyed by high doses of
chemotherapy.
Heart Diseases
Some heart diseases are as follow
Angina Pectoris
Human with angina, experience pain in the
centre of the chest. The chest can feel
constricted and tight, but the pain can also be
oppressive, as if something is crushing your
chest. Pain starts in the centre of the chest
behind the breast bone (sternum) or on the left
side of the front of the chest. It can spread out to
other parts of your body like your arms and
stomach.
Myocardial Infarction
● It is commonly known as heart attack, results
from the interruption of blood supply to a part
of the heart, causing heart cells to die.
● This is most commonly due to occlusion
(blockage) of a coronary artery following the
rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic
plaque, which is an unstable collection of
lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids) and white
blood cells (especially macrophages) in the
wall of an artery.
● The result is ischemia (restriction in blood
supply) and ensuing oxygen, if left untreated
for a sufficient period of time, can cause
damage or death (infarction) of heart muscle
tissue (myocardium).
Heart Arrest
● It occurs when the heart is unable to provide
sufficient pump action to distribute blood flow
to meet the needs of the body. Heart arrest
can cause a number of symptoms including
shortness of breath, leg swelling and exercise
intolerance.
● The condition is diagnosed with
echocardiography and blood tests. Treatment
commonly consists of lifestyle measures such
as smoking cessation, light exercise including
breathing protocols, decreased salt intake and
other dietary changes and medications.
Arthritis
● It affects the musculoskeletal system,
specifically the joints. It is the main cause of
disability among people over 55 years of age in
industrialised countries.
● Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) It is a long-term
disease that leads to inflammation of the
joints and surrounding tissues. It can also
affect other organs.
Osteoarthritis
It is a joint inflammation that results
from cartilage degeneration. It can be
caused by ageing, heredity and injury
from trauma or disease. The most
common symptom of osteoarthritis is
pain in the affected joint(s) after
repetitive use.
Gout
Gout is a kind of arthritis. It can cause
an attack of sudden burning pain,
stiffness and swelling in a joint,
usually a big toe. These attacks can
happen over and over unless gout is
treated. Overtime, they can harm
your joints, tendons and other tissues.
Gout is most common in men.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
● Gonorrhoea It is caused by
bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Anyone who has any type of sexual
contact can catch gonorrhoea. The
infection can be spread by contact
with the mouth, vagina, penis or
anus.
● Syphilis It is a sexually
transmitted infection caused by the
spirochete bacterium Treponema
pallidum sub-species pallidum.
The primary route of transmission
is through sexual contact; it may
also be transmitted from mother to
foetus during pregnancy or at birth,
resulting in congenital syphilis.
● Genital herpes It is a Sexually
Transmitted Infection (STI) caused
by the Herpes Simplex Virus
(HSV).
● Trichomoniasis It is a sexually
transmitted infection caused by the
parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.
Mental Disorder
A mental disorder or mental illness is
a psychological pattern or anomali,
potentially reflected in behaviour, that
is generally associated with distress or
disability and which is not considered
part of normal development of a
person’s culture. This may be
associated with particular regions or
functions of the brain or rest of the
nervous system, often in a social
context.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 443
Alzheimer’s Disease
It is a progressive mental deterioration
that can occur in middle or old age, due to
generalised degeneration of the brain. It is
the commonest cause of premature
senility.
DRUGS
A drug is a substance, which when taken
in, alters the body functions. Repeated use
of drugs particularly for obtaining quick
pleasure is called drug abuse.
Some Simple Drugs
Below are the types of simple drugs
Analgesic (Pain Killers)
These drugs act in various ways on the
peripheral and central nervous system;
they include paracetamol
(acetaminophen), the non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such
as the salicylates, narcotic drugs such as
morphine, synthetic drugs with narcotic
properties such as tramadol and various
others.
Anaesthetic
An anaesthetic is used to temporarily
reduce or take away sensation, usually so
that painful procedures or surgery can be
performed.
There are two types of anaesthetics
● General which make the patient
unconscious.
● Local which numb the part of the body
that would otherwise feel pain.
Antibiotics (Bactericidal)
These are powerful medicines that fight
bacterial infections. When used properly,
antibiotics can save lives. They either kill
bacteria or stop them for reproducing.
Antihistamines
These are medicines that can be used to
relieve severe itching and help in breaking
histamine cycle. It leads to thickening and
weeping of the skin and generally makes the
eczema worse and more likely to become
infected because scratching breaks the skin.
Tranquiliser
It is a drug that induces tranquility in an
individual. The minor tranquilisers induce a
feeling of calm and relaxation. Depending
on the medication and dosage, this can
range from feeling of mild euphoria to states
of drowsiness, confusion and lightedness.
Sedative
It is a substance that induces sedation by
reducing irritability or excitement. At higher
doses it may result in slurred speech,
staggering gait, poor judgment and slow,
uncertain reflexes.
Doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepines,
when used as a hypnotic induce sleep, tend
to be higher than amounts used to relieve
anxiety, whereas only low doses are needed
to provide a peaceful and calming sedative
effect.
Narcotic
It is originally referred medically to any
psychoactive compound with any
sleep-inducing properties.
Antipyretics
(Temperature Reduction)
These are drugs or herbs that reduce fever.
Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to over
ride an interleukin-induced increase in
temperature. The body then works to lower
the temperature, resulting in a reduction of
fever.
● Bacteria of cholera and TB was discovered
by Robert Koch.

Vaccination
● It is the process of artificial introduction of germs or the germ substance called
antigen into the body for developing resistance to a particular disease. The material
introduced into the body is called vaccine.
● A vaccine is a dead or weakened microbes. They are unable to produce disease as they
are less in number but they stimulate the body to produce antibodies.
● World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1974 officially launched a global vaccination
programme to protect children from six fatal diseases. Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus,
polio, TB (Tuberculosis) and measles. It was launched in India in 1985.
● BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) vaccine is given to protect against TB (Tuberculosis).

GENETICS
It is the study of heredity and
variations. The term ‘Genetics’ was
coined by W Bateson in 1905. Gregor
Johann Mondel (commonly called
Father of Genetics) proposed three
laws
(a) Law of Dominance It states that
crossing of plant with red and
white flower produced plants
only with red flower i.e.,
dominant trait appear and
recessive disappeared.
(b) Law of Segregation It states
that allele of a gene separate
during gamete formation. It is
also called law of purity of
genetics or law of splitting of
hybrids. It gives 3 : 1 ratio in F2
generation.
(c) Law of Independent
Assortment It states that two or
more genes assort independently
during inheritance. It gives 9 : 3 :
3 : 1 ratio in F2
generation.
Linkage is an exception to this
law.
● Test Cross The cross between
heterozygous F1
and homozygous
recessive is called test cross. In test
cross, the monohybrid ratio is 1 : 1
and dihybrid ratio is 1:1:1:1.
● Back Cross The cross between
heterozygous F1 hybrid and
homozygous dominant allele is
called back cross.
Some Important
Genetic Terms
● Phenotype It is the physical appearance of an
individual.
● Genotype It is the entire genetic complement
of an individual organism.
● Alleles The two individual genes in a
particular gene pair that occupies same locus
(position) on homologous pair of chromosome.
● Dominant and Recessive Traits (inherited
character) The traits may be dominant or
recessive depending upon the fact that on
crossing the individuals (which are
homozygous for a particular trait of same
character the trait which appears in the F1
generation is called dominant and the other
one is recessive.
● Hybrid An offspring, which is obtained from a
cross between two genetically different
parents.
● Linkage The phenomenon of genic
inheritance in which genes of a particular
chromosome show their tendency to inherit
together, i.e., tendency to retain their parental
combination even in the offsprings is known as
linkage.
● Mutation It is a sudden change of a gene (gene
mutation) or chromosome (chromosomal
mutation) from one form to another, which are
passed to the daughter cells.
● Heteroploidy It is the variation in
chromosome number.
● Pleiotropy It occurs when one gene
influences multiple phenotypic traits.

450 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Biotechnology
It deals with technique of using live
micro-organisms, their parts or processes for
the manufacture of useful or commercial
substances. It has two core techniques i.e.,
genetic engineering and technique to
facilitate the growth and multiplication of
only desired microbes. In genetic engineering
(also called recombinant DNA technology)
restriction endonucleases are very useful.
They cleave the DNA at specific locations
called restriction sites.
● Vectors are organisms or their parts used to
transfer the desired DNA from one
organism to another. The common vectors
are bacteriophage, cosmids, phagemids,
plasmids etc.
● Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
developed by Kary Mullis (1983) can clone
or amplify the small amount of DNA. It
involves denaturation, primer annealing
and polymerisation in the definite
sequence.
Applications of Biotechnology
A number of transgenic plants, medicines,
acids are produced through genetic
engineering.
Bt Cotton
It was developed to reduce the heavy reliance
on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a
chemical harmful only to a small fraction of
insects.
Bt Brinjal
It is a transgenic brinjal (also known as an egg
plant or aubergine) created by inserting a
crystal protein gene (Cry IAc) from the soil
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into the
genome of various brinjal varieties.
Golden Rice
● It is a variety of Oryza sativa (rice)
produced through genetic engineering
to biosynthesise beta-carotene, a
precursor of pro-vitamin-A in the
edible parts of rice. Golden rice was
developed as a fortified food to be used
in areas, where there is a shortage of
diet having vitamin-A.
● Golden Rice 2 produces up to 23
times more beta-carotene than the
original variety of golden rice. Golden
rice was created by lngo Potrykus of
the Institute of Plant Sciences at the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,
working with Peter Beyer of the
University of Freiburg.
● Carotene impart orange colour to
carrots and is the reason why
genetically modified rice is golden. For
the golden rice to make beta-carotene,
three new genes are inserted: two from
daffodils and the third from a
bacterium.
Flavr Savr
By the use of antisense RNA technology
the enzyme polygalacto-uronase, which
causes damage to pectin is deactivated
and the tomato is kept fresh for longer
duration.
Canola
It is either of rape seed (Brassica napus
L) or field mustard (Brassica campestris
L or Brassica rapavar). Its nodes are
used to produce edible oil suitable for
consumption by humans and livestock.
The oil is also suitable as biodiesel.
Dairy Products
● Cheese is prepared by the coagulation
of casein and other minor milk
proteins (curdling of milk) by an
enzyme rennin extracted from calf
gastric mucosa.
● Streptococcus and Lactobacillus
species are involved in the
manufacture of most cheese.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 451
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
It is Gram positive, soil-dwelling bacterium,
commonly used as a biological pesticide. The Cry
toxin found in the bacterium is extracted and used
as a pesticide. It also occurs naturally in the gut of
caterpillars of various types of moths and
butterflies, as well as on the dark surfaces of plants.
● In cheese manufacture,
micro-organisms are important in both
souring and ripening processes.
● Semisoft blue Roquefort cheese of
France is produced using the mold
Penicillium roqueforti.
● Yoghurt is a preserved milk product
having a distinct taste and a thick
texture than milk.
● Yoghurt is made by fermenting whole
milk with a mixture of Lactobacillus
bulgaricus, Streptococcus lactis and S.
thermophilus at 40° to 46°C.
Vitamins
● Vitamin C was the first vitamin to be
produced by a fermentation process
using Acetobacter, a wild bacterium.
● Bacteria used for industrial production
of vitamin-B12 are propionibacterium
shermanii, P. freundenreichii and
Pseudomonas denitrificans.
● Vitamin-B2
(Riboflavin) is synthesised
by many micro-organisms including
bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The fungus,
Ashbya gossypii is used for the
microbial production of vitamin-B2
.
Biotechnologies in
Human Health
● Monoclonal antibodies are made
outside the body by the hybrid cell
cultures known as hybridomas.
● Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are
antibodies that are identical because
they were produced by one type of
immune cell and are all clones of a
single parent cell.
● A biochip is a discrete collection of
gene fragments on a stamp-sized chip
that can be used to screen for the
presence of particular gene variants.
● Biochips allow rapid screening of gene
profiles, a tool that promises to have a
revolutionary impact on medicine and
society.
● Biochips can help in identifying precise
forms of cancer.
● Gene therapy is the treatment of disease
by replacing, altering or supplementing a
gene whose absence or abnormality is
responsible for the disease. Gene therapy is
unique as it employs the genetic material,
i.e. DNA, itself as the means of treatment.
DNA finger printing is the technique, in
which the banding pattern of DNA
fragments is compared and can be used in
many species, including human, to indicate
relativity. (used for rape victim, paternity,
other criminals).
● Human insulin or humulin is the first
genetically engineered pharmaceutical
product, developed by Eli Lilly and
company in 1982.
● Genentech, a California-based company,
have produced human growth hormone
(hGH) from genetically engineered
bacteria.
● Somatostatin is the first polypeptide,
which was expressed in E coli as a part of
the fusion peptide.
● BST or Bovine Somatotropin is produced
in a large quantity from milk production in
cows.
● In 1997, a transgenic cow ‘Rosie’
produced human alpha-lactalbumin
protein enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre).
● It is possible to cure phenylketonuria
disease by using recombinant DNA
techniques in early period of pregnancy.
● Urokinase is involved in dissolution of
blood clots. It has been synthesised in huge
quantity by using genetically engineered
bacteria with urokinase genes.

* Milk is pasteurised (preserved) by boiling it at 62.8° for 30 minutes (Low Temperature Holding
method or LTH) or at 71.7.°C for 15 seconds (high temperature holding method). These
treatments kill all bacteria.
Botany
● It is the branch of biology which
deals with plants, which are
considered as multicellular
ulcerates. The cells of these
organisms contain a cell wall
made up of cellulose and other
polysaccharides. Plants have the
ability to synthesise their own
food (autotrophic) in the
presence of sunlight, via the
process of photosynthesis.
● Plants have two main groups i.e.,
cryptogams (lower plants
without well defined flowers and
seeds) and phanerogams (higher
plants with well defined flowers
and seeds).
● Cryptogams further contains
thallophytes and pteridophytes
with bryophytes in between.
Here, thallophytes means those
plants which have thallus like
body i.e., without roots, leaves
and stem e.g., algae, fungi,
bacteria etc.
● All the plants of cryptogams are
considered as primitive as these
do not have well defined features
of plants like presence of phloem
(a tissue for food transport) and
presence of xylem (a tissue for
water transport etc).
● Phanerogams are well defined
advanced plants with proper roots,
leaves and stem and well
differentiated tissue system. These
can be categorised as
Gymnosperms (Naked Seed) and
Angiosperms (Covered seed)
plants.
■ Algae like Nostoc, Anabaena etc are
used as manure.
■ Sphagnum a genus of mosses is
used as fuel and antiseptic.
● Some plants catch insects to
fulfill their nitrogen requirement.
Such plants are called
insectivorous plants.
PLANT MORPHOLOGY
Plant morphology represents a study of the
development, form and structure of plants and by
implication, an attempt to interpret these on the
basis of similarity of plan and origin.
Classification of Plants
● Plant classification is the placing of known
plants into groups or categories to show their
relationship.
● Thus, plants are classified into group having
same characteristics.
● Thallophyta A phylum of plants of very
diverse habit and structure, e.g., Algae, fungi
and lichens.
● Bryophytes Have stems and leaves but lack
true vascular tissue and reproduce by spores
e.g., Mosses, hornworts, liverworts etc.
● Pteridophytes Vascular plants with leaves,
stems and roots, but lack both seeds and
flowers, e.g., Ferns, Lycopodium, horsetails etc.
● Gymnosperms Group of seed producing
plants. A plant that has seeds unprotected by an
ovary or fruit, e.g., Conifer, cycads, pine tree etc.
● Angiosperms (Vascular plants) A major group
of flowering plants. Their characteristics are the
possession of protected seeds or fruits, e.g.,
Rose, tulip, tomatoes etc.
Virus
The term virus was given by Pasteur. Virus was
discovered by Iwanowski in the extract of diseased
tobacco plant. Virus is a nucleoprotein entity which do
not have machinery of its own but can utilise the
synthetic machinery of living cell of other organisms for
its multiplication. Virus is considered to be a cellular,
i.e. without a cell.
Bacteria
Basically, bacteria are unicellular prokaryotes. Their
cell wall is generally, made up of peptidoglycans and
polysaccharides. Genetic material is not organised into
nucleus, i.e. a primitive nucleus is present (without a
nuclear membrane). All membrane bound cell
organelles are absent.
Flagella, if present is single-stranded, made up of
protein flagellin.
Gamete formation is absent.
454 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
PARTS OF A PLANT
Different parts of a plant perform different
function. Accordingly they are divided into
root, stem, leaves, flower, fruits and seeds.
Root
It is that part of plant body, which develops
from radicle and grows down into the earth.
It gives secondary and tertiary roots.
Plants have two types of root systems
1. Tap root develop from radicle, normally
found in dicot plants.
2. Adventitious root with a main tap root
that is larger and grows faster than the
branch roots.
Modification of Tap Roots
Conical This type of root is thickened
towards base but thin near the side of the
plant, e.g., Carrot.
Napiform This type of root is very broad at
the top and tapering like a tail at the bottom,
e.g., turnip, beet root etc.
Fusiform This type of root is inflated in the
middle portion, while thin towards bottom
and top, e.g., Radish.
Pneumatophores This type of root is found
in salty soil near the sea and for the
respiratory activities, it undergoes toward
negative geotropism, e.g., Rhizophora, plant
sundari etc.
Mycorrhizal These roots are known from
90% of plant species and are mutualistic
association of a fungus with plant root tissue.
Most plants require specific mycorrhizal fungi
without, which they are unable to absorb
sufficient quantities of P, Zn and Mn.
The fungus takes the place of root hairs and
may penetrate the cortex completely
(endomycorrhizae) or remain on the surface
of the root (ectomycorrhizae).
Functions of Root
● Keeps the plants static.
● Transports water and mineral salts to the
stem and ultimately to the leaves.
● Absorbs water and mineral salts from
the soil.
Stem
It is the ascending organ of the plant,
which is formed by the elongation of
plumule. Thus, stem is that part of the
plant, which originates from plumule and
goes towards sunlight opposite to the
gravity.
Underground Modifications
In the adverse conditions underground
stems store their food and become
thickened and tuberous.
Various types of modifications can be
described as
Stem tuber Potato
Bulb Onion, garlic, tulips, lilies etc.
Corm Gladiolus, Crocus sativus or
saffron etc.
Rhizome Ginger, turmeric, arrow root
etc.
Subaerial Modifications
There are various types of modifications
exists in such types of stem
Runner Grass root, Mereilia etc.
Stolon Mint, jasmine, strawberry etc.
Offset Water hyacinth, Pistia etc.
Sucker Pudira, chrysanthemum etc.
Aerial Modifications
Various aerial modifications are:
Stem tendril Grape
Stem thorn Lemon, roses, jujube plum
or Chinese date
Phylloclade Cactus
Bulbils Ruscus.
Leaf
It is a green part, its main function is to
make food through photosynthesis and
respiration. Leaves are mainly of two
types
1. Simple Leaf A leaf having one blade
but blade is not divided, e.g., mango.
2. Compound Leaf A leaf with more
than one blade. All blades are
attached to a single leaf stem, e.g.,
Rose, orange etc.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 455
Parts of a Typical Leaf
Leaf Base It is the lowermost part of the leaf, borne onto the node of the stem or its
branches.
Petiole The stalk of leaf that connects the lamina with the stem or its branch is
called petiole.
Lamina It is the terminal, flattened, green and conspicuous part of a leaf and is
specialised to manufacture food (photosynthesis).
Inflorescence
The arrangement of flowers on a floral
axis is called inflorescence. The portion of
stem that bear cluster of flowers is called
peduncle and the stalk of individual flower
is called pedicel. The inflorescence has
been classified into five distinct types
according to modes of branching and
modification of peduncle.
Solitary
Racemose
Cymose
Mixed
Specialized
Out of four, two types are most important.
Racemose Inflorescence
In racemose inflorescence, the main axis
is capable of continuous growth. The
flowers show acropetal succession on the
main axis.
Cymose Inflorescence
In cymose inflorescence, the main axis ends
in a flower, since the peduncle stops growing.
The flowers show basipetal succession.

Stem Root
Cuticle or cutinised outer walls of epidermal
cells present.
Cuticle or cutinised outer walls absent.
Epidermis is protective in function. Epidermis (young) is absorptive in function. It is
called epiblema or rhizodermis.
Stomata is present in epidermis. Stomata is absent in epiblema.
Stem hairs are additional cells, i.e., they do
not arise as outgrowths of epidermal cells.
Root hairs are tubular outgrowths of the epiblema
(epidermal) cells.
Chloroplasts may be present in some outer
cells of the cortex.
Chloroplast almost absent.
Cortex narrow. Cortex broad.
Endodermis is inconspicuous. Endodermis is conspicuous.
Pericycle not involved in secondary growth. Pericycle actively involved in root branches
formation and in secondary growth.
Xylem characteristically endarch. Xylem characteristically exarch.
Xylem and phloem fibres present. Xylem and phloem fibres usually absent.
Secondary growth, if occurs, takes place by
primary cambium, which is both
interfascicular and intrafascicular.
Secondary growth, if present, takes place by
secondary cambium, the conjunctive parenchyma
and pericycle start meristematic activity and
participate.
FLOWER
It is a modified shoot that consists of
accessary whorls (calyx and corolla) and
essential whorls (androecium and
gynoecium). The plant, which bears both
male and female flower is called
monoecious, while separate plants with
one type of flower are called dioecious.
Calyx
The outermost whorl consisting of units
called sepals; these are typically green and
enclose the rest of the flower in the bud
stage, however, they can be absent or
prominent and petal-like in some species.
Corolla
The next whorl toward the apex, composed
of units called petals, which are typically
thin, soft and coloured to attract animals
that help the process of pollination.
Androecium
The next whorl, consisting of units called
stamens. It consist of two parts–a stalk
called a filament, topped by an anther,
where pollen is produced by meiosis and
eventually dispersed.
Gynoecium
● The innermost whorl of a flower,
consisting of one or more units called
carpels. The carpel or multiple fused
carpels form a hollow structure called an
ovary, which produces ovules internally.
● Ovules are megasporangia and they in
turn produce megaspores by meiosis,
which develop into female
gametophytes. These give rise to egg
cells.
● The gynoecium of a flower is also
described using an alternative
terminology, wherein the structure one
sees in the innermost whorl (consisting
of an ovary, style and stigma) is called
a pistil.
● A pistil may consist of a single carpel or a
number of carpels fused together. The
sticky tip of the pistil, the stigma, is the
receptor of pollen. The supportive stalk,
the style, becomes the pathway for pollen
tubes to grow from pollen grains
adhering to the stigma.
Pollination
Transfer of pollens from stamens to stigma
is called pollination.
It is of two types
Self-pollination
Transfer of pollen from stamen to the
stigma of same flower or different flower of
the same plant.
Cross–pollination
In this, pollen reach from anther of one
flower to the stigma of different flower of
same species. This is done with the help of
air, water, insects or animals (agents of
pollination). In most flowers, maximum
pollination occurs by the method of
anemophily (by mind). In this mode,
pollen-loss is maximum.
Fruits
It is ripened ovary of flower. The fruit may
be true (formed from ovary alone) or false
(developed from other part of flower except
ovary). These are of three main types, i.e.,
simple, aggregate and composite.
Simple Fruit
A simple fruit always develops from a single
ovary containing one or more carpels and
may or may not include additional
modified accessory floral (perianth)
structures. In addition, a simple fruit is
either fleshy or dry. Fleshy fruits are edible
and are seen in the fresh fruit and
vegetable section of your local super
market.
Aggregate Fruits
These are groups of simple fruits, developed
from multicarpellary or polycarpellary,
apocarpous ovary of a flower. These are
etaerio of follicle, etaerio of achenes, etaerio
of berries and etaerio of drupes.
Composite Fruits
A composite or multiple fruit develops from
the complete inflorescence. These are of
two types
Sorosis A multiple fruit derived from just
the pistils of many unisexual flowers of an
inflorescence, e.g., Mulberry, jackfruit,
pineapple etc.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 457
Syconus A multiple fruit derived from
numerous ovaries borne on the inside of
the fleshy receptacle of an inflorescence.
Also in accessory fruit, the fleshy portion of
the fruit is formed by the hollow peduncle
of the (inside-out) inflorescence, e.g.,
peepal, gular.
Seeds
Seed is a fertilised mature ovule that
possesses an embryonic plant.
There are two types of seeds
Non-endospermic seeds non-albuminous
seed Endosperm is absent in this seed
and stores their food material in
cotyledons, e.g., Gram, pea.
Endospermic or albuminous seed These
possess endosperm and store their food in
it, e.g., Castor, maize, rice.
AGRICULTURE
● Agriculture is derived from Latin words
Ager and Cultura. Ager means land or
field and Cultura means cultivation.
Therefore, the term Agriculture means
cultivation of land, i.e., the science and
art of producing crops and livestock for
economic purposes.
● It was the key development in the rise of
sedentary human civilisation, whereby
farming of domesticated species created
food surpluses that nurtured the
development of civilisation.
AGRONOMY
The branch of agriculture that deals with
field crop production and soil
management. Agronomists generally work
with crops that are grown on a large scale
(e.g., small grains) and that require
relatively little management. Agronomic
experiments focus on a variety of factors
relating to crop plants, including yield,
diseases, cultivation and sensitivity to
factors such as climate and soil.
Cropping Pattern
Crop Rotation
It is the practice of growing a series of
dissimilar types of crops in the same area
in sequential seasons. It confers various
benefits to the soil.
Crop rotation also mitigates the build-up of
pathogens and pests that often occurs,
when one species is continuously cropped
and can also improve soil structure and
fertility by alternating deep-rooted and
shallow-rooted plants.
Intensive Cropping
It refers to efficient use of water, nutrients
and tillage. The interdependence of and
synergies among water, nutrients and
energy in regard to increasing crop
performance is generally preferred.
Main Crops for Rotations
One yearly Paddy and wheat
Two yearly Maize and cotton
Three yearly Tomato and lady’s finger
Four yearly Cotton and wheat
Zero Tillage
It is a way of growing crops from year to year
without disturbing the soil through tillage.
No-till is an agricultural technique, which
increases the amount of water and organic
matter (nutrients) in the soil and decreases
erosion. It increases the amount and variety
of life in and on the soil.
It has two distnctive features
● Sole Cropping It is to cultivate a pure
variety of crop.
● Monoculture Planting a sole crop in a
field regularly but harvest it single in a
year.
Companion Planting/Cropping
It is the planting of different crops in
proximity on the theory that they assist each
other in nutrient uptake, pest control,
pollination and other factors necessary in
increasing crop productivity.
Intercropping
It is the practice of growing two or more
crops in proximity. It is particularly
important not to have crops competing with
each other for physical space, nutrients,
water or sunlight.
The most common goal of intercropping is
to produce a greater yield on a given piece of
land by making use of resources that would
otherwise not be utilised by a single crop.
458 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Multiple Cropping
It is the practice of growing two or more crops
in the same space during a single growing
season.
It can take the form of double-cropping, in
which a second crop is planted after the first
has been harvested or relay cropping, in which
the second crop is started amidst the first crop
before it has been harvested.
Farming System
Mixed Farming
It is one in which crop production is combined
with the rearing of livestock. The livestock
enterprises are complementary to crop
production, so as to provide a balance and
productive system of farming.
Ranching
It is the practice of raising the grazing livestock
such as cattles, sheep or poultry. The area is
known as ranch and the practice is called
ranching. The ranching and cowboy tradition
originated in Spain. During the Reconquista in
middle ages the Spanish nobles got huge lands
on grants.
Terrace Farming
It is a piece of sloped land, which has been
landscaped in such a way that, the practice of
farming can be easily carried out.
Generally, this type of farming is done in the
mountain regions along the slope. The land is
cutout along the slope and terraces are made.
This system is more common in North-Eastern
hilly tracts of India.
Truck Farming
(Marketing Gardening)
It is a horticultural practice of growing fruits,
vegetables, etc., on commercial basis, in trucks
for direct delivery to big restaurants, hotels and
motels. This technique was evolved by the
english speaking farmers, who referred them
as truck farms in 19th century.
Organic Farming
Organic agriculture means a process of
developing a viable and sustainable
agroecosystem. It is an agricultural practice
that relies on crop rotation, green manure,
compost and biological pest control.
Organic farming uses fertilisers and
pesticides but strictly limits the use of
synthetic fertilisers, pesticides, plant
growth regulators such as hormones,
livestock antibiotics, food additives
and genetically modified organisms.
Blanching
In it, the young shoots of a plant are
covered to exclude light to prevent
photosynthesis, which would produce
chlorophyll and thus, remain pale in
colour. Blanched vegetables have a
more delicate flavour and texture than
unblanched.
SEED SCIENCE
● It is a basic and most important input
of agriculture. A good quality seed is
one, which is free from adulterants,
diseased or insect-pest infestations,
which hinder or reduce the quality of
a seed.
● The era of hybridisation of seeds
started after 1930. The hybrid seeds
are the cross breeded seeds, which
are artificially developed so as to have
the desirable characters. While
developing a hybrid seed, it goes
through the various developmental
stages.
● These are
¡ Nuclear Seed It is initial pure seed
of an improved variety available with
the breeder.
¡ Breeder’s Seed It is the seed
obtained from the progeny
(generation) of nucleus seed.
¡ Foundation Seed The breeder
seeds grown on State Government
farms and agriculture universities
under scientific observations and
check.
¡ Registered Seed The seeds grown
from nucleus, breeder’s and
foundation seeds.
¡ Certified Seed The seeds certified
before release as a new variety
having all the desirable characters.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 459
Synthetic and Composite
Seed Varieties
● Synthetic variety: It is a variety
developed by selecting a number of inbred
lines with good General Combinig Ability
(GCA). Synthetic varieties can be
developed by using clones or inbreeds,
e.g., ICMS 7703.
● Composite variety: It is a variety that is
developed by mixing of seeds of various
outstanding inbred lines, which have
similar characteristics. So, the exact
reconstitution of composite variety is not
possible, e.g., Sona, Shakti, African tall etc.
Hybrid Seed
● It is produced by cross-pollinated plants.
In hybrid seed production, the crosses are
specific and controlled. The advantage of
growing hybrid seed compared to inbred
lines comes from heterosis.
● To produce hybrid seed, elite inbred
varieties are crossed with welldocumented and consistent phenotypes
(such as yield) and the resulting hybrid
seed is collected.
Artificial Seed
It is encapsulated plant propagule (somatic
embryo/shoot bud) in a suitable matrix,
containing substances like nutrients, growth
regulators, herbicides, insecticides,
fungicides and mycorrhizae, which will
allow and help it to grow into a complete
plantlet.
Genetically Modified Seeds
It is that they have been altered or modified,
through biotechnology to have their genetic
structure changed. This is usually
accomplished by either adding or taking
away genes of the original.
Terminator Seed
The term Terminator seeds as it applies to
the area of agriculture can be defined as a
descriptive term used by some for seeds that
have been genetically engineered to produce
a crop whose first generation produces
sterile seeds, thus preventing a second
generation from being grown from seeds
saved from the first.
Traitor Technology
In this technology, to make the induced
gene active, certain chemicals are used.
Many Multi National Corporations
(MNCs) are trying to bring this in India
and environmentalists are opposing it.
Crop Diversification
It is intended to give a wider choice in the
production of a variety of crops in a given
area so as to expand production related
activities on various crops and also to
lessen risk. Crop diversification in India is
generally viewed as a shift from
traditionally grown less remunerative
crops to more remunerative crops.
AGROFORESTRY
It is an integrated approach of using the
interactive benefits from combining trees
and shrubs with crops and/or livestock. It
combines agricultural and forestry
technologies to create more diverse,
productive, profitable, healthy and
sustainable land-use systems. A narrow
definition of agroforestry is trees on farms.
Vermicomposting
It is a method of using worms to transform
organic waste into a nutrient-rich
fertiliser. It is a healthy and clean way to
eliminate wastes going into our landfills,
which improves the environment.
Vermicomposting is inexpensive and only
takes two to three months to produce
results.
Plant Preservation
Like other organisms plants can also be
infected with the disease. All these
disease causing agents are called Pests.
Main causative agents are virus, bacteria
and fungi. As for example, wheat is
infected with rust and smut. In paddy,
generally blast is found, which is spread by
Gandhi bug. In cotton, bollworm causes
disease.
Keeping fruits and vegetables fresh for a
longer period without hampering its
physical and chemical properties, is
called fruits and vegetables preservation.
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 has
Part-3 for its revelation.
460 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Methods of Preservation
Various methods of preservation are
Low Temperature
Microbes become inactive at low temperature. We can keep them in freezer.
Pasteurisation
It is a mild heating treatment at
temperatures up to 100°C (which is the
boiling point of water at elevations up to
300 metres above sea level). This method
causes only a slight decrease in taste and
nutritional value. Pasteurised products
therefore spoil faster than sterilised
products.
Canning
There are two primary methods of canning
A hot water bath and pressure canning
which ever method you use, be sure to use
jars with lids made specifically for that
technique. Glass canning jars, which are
reusable, come in various sizes (most are
single pints or quarts), so choose one that
best suits your canning needs.
Integrated Pest
Management (IPM)
It is an ecological approach to agricultural
pest control that integrates
pesticides/herbicides into a management
system incorporating a range of practices
for economic control of a pest. An IPM
system is designed around six basic
components
Acceptable Pest Levels
● The emphasis is on control, not
eradication. IPM programmes first work
to establish acceptable pest levels, called
action thresholds and apply controls if
those thresholds are crossed. IPM holds
that wiping out an entire pest population
is often impossible and the attempt can
be expensive and environmentally unsafe.
● These thresholds are pest and site
specific, meaning that it may be
acceptable at one site to have a weed
such as white clover, but at another site
it may not be acceptable.
● By allowing a pest population to survive
at a reasonable threshold, selection
pressure is reduced. This stops the pest
gaining resistance to chemicals produced
by the plant or applied to the crops. By
not killing all the pests there are some
un-resistant pests left that will dilute any
resistant genes that appear.
Preventive Cultural Practices
Selecting varieties best for local growing
conditions and maintaining healthy crops is
the first line of defence, together with plant
quarantine and cultural techniques such as
crop sanitation (e.g., removal of diseased
plants to prevent spread of infection).
Monitoring
Regular observation is the cornerstone of IPM.
Observation is broken into two steps, first
inspection and second, identification. Visual
inspection, insect and spore traps and other
measurement methods and monitoring tools
are used to monitor pest levels.
Since, insects are cold-blooded, their
physical development is dependent on the
temperature of their environment. Many
insects have had their development cycles
modelled in terms of degree days. Monitor
the degree days of an environment to
determine when is the optimal time for a
specific insect’s outbreak.
Responsible Pesticide Use
Synthetic pesticides are generally used as
required and often only at specific times in a
pest life cycle.
Locust Control and Research
On seeing the grave situation of locust
attack, a warning centre as, locust warning
organisation has been created, at Jodhpur.
It has locust surveillance and monitoring
through 5 circle offices and 23 outposts.
Mechanical Controls
They include simple hand-picking, erecting
insect barriers, using traps, vacuuming and
tillage to disrupt breeding.
Biological Controls
The main focus for biological control is on
promoting beneficial insects that eat target
pests. Biological insecticides, derived from
naturally occurring microorganisms
(e.g., Bt, entomopa-thogenic fungi and
entomo- pathogenic nematodes).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 461
Animal Husbandry
The rearing of animals for specific
purposes is called domestication and
such animals are called domestic
animals. Domestication of animals
started during the hunting and gathering
phase of human civilisation.
BUFFALOES
Bubalus bubalis is its scientific name.
Generally, it is assumed that India is place
of its origin. There are two types breeds of
buffaloes
Exotic or Marshy

present. Rearing of cow and bull is preferred
in India. 16% of the world cow and bull are
present in India.
Varieties of Cows
Some varieties of cows are as follows
Humped Indian Breeds
These are high milk-yielding and their calves
are not used for agricultural purposes.
Following are its important breeds
Sahiwal Actually found in Mont- Gomari
in Pakistan. In India, it is found in Punjab,
Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and
Bihar. It gives around 2150 L milk in a year.

SHEEP
There are many breeds of sheep (Ovis
aries) in our country. Today sheeps are
raised in all parts of the world. Sheep
provides us with wool, skin and mutton.
A sheep lives for about 13 years.
Exotic Breeds of Sheep
● Merino This is the main
representative of the Merino breed in
Australia and is found in extremely
high number throughout New South
Wales, Queensland, Victoria and
Western Australia.
● South Devon The South Devon is a
longwool and meat breed which
originated in South Devon and
Cornwall in England. They are of the
English Longwool type and are similar
to Devon Longwoolled but are larger.
Both sexes are polled and are naturally
hornless.
● Lincoln It is found in England and it
is useful for wool and meat.
● Corriedale It is mainly found in New
Zealand and Australia. It is useful for
wool and meat.
● Romney Marshy The Romney
Marshy are found in England.
Romney wool has the finest fibre
diameter of all the longwool breeds.
These are mainly used for wool
production.
Shearing of Wool
It is essential to promote the health of
sheep. The removal of hairs (wool) from
the recommended periods for shearing
of wool are winter (February-March) and
rainy (August- September) season when
rich grazing ground is available.
The sheeps are washed properly before
the removal of hairs. The manufacture
of wool from sheep hairs is a
complicated process consisting of
cleaning, drying, bleaching, dyeing,
spining and twisting.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 463
GOAT
There are many breeds of goat (Capra
capra) in our country. Goat provide us
milk, meat, skin and hair. The fine soft
wool called Pashmina is the underfur of
Kashmir and Tibet goats.
Noori
World’s first Pashmina goat clone,
produced in Kashmir has been named
Noori and Arabic word referring to light.
Funded by world bank, the clone project
was a jointy worked on Skaust and Nari
Karnal.
The clone has come as good news for
fine fibre producing Pashmina goats,
which are only spotted at an altitude of

mammal of genus Sus.
● All breeds of pigs have descended from the
European wild boar Sus scrofa or a
crossbreed of this and the Asiatic species,
S. indicus. The care and management of
pigs is called piggery.
● Pigs are the most prolific breeders and
quick growers among the domestic animals.
● A group of 10 sows (female hog) and one
boar may produce over 160 piglets in a year.

mammal of genus Camelus. It is popularly
called the ship of the desert because of its
great travelling power in a desert.
It is a valuable beast carrying burden in hot
desert and semi-desert regions as it can live on
minimum food and water when travelling with
load. There are two types of camels
1. Arabian camels (Camelus dromedarius)
With a single hump, short hair and found
in North Africa to India. It does not occur
in wild form.
2. Turkish or Bactrian camels (Camelus

INTRODUCTION
The word computer has been derived from
the Latin word ‘COMPUTARE’, which
means to compute or to calculate.
A computer can be defined as an
electronic device used to calculate and
manipulate the data (i.e. input) and
generates an output in the form of useful
information by following a set of
procedural instructions.
British scientist Charles Babbage is
considered as the Father of Computer.
He invented the first mechanical
computer in early 19th century and
further in 1833, he conceived a automatic
analytical engine for performing
arithmetic functions.
Alan Mathison Turing is widely regarded as
the Father of Modern Computers or Father
of theortical computer science and Artificial

Types of Computer
Computer can be classified on three
basis
On the Basis of Functions
● Analog Computers This is a type
of computer that reads data using
measurement and some program
scale. It calculates by measuring
continuous changes in the physical
quantities. e.g. Mechanical
integrators, nomogram,
speedometer etc.
● Digital Computers This is a
computer that performs calculations
and logical operations with
quantities represented as binary
digits. e.g. Desktop, mainframe etc.
● Hybrid Computers These
computers are the combination of
both analog and digital computers. It
works by measuring quantity and
calculating logical operations. e.g.
ECG monitors, HRS-100 etc.
On the Basis of Purposes
● General Purpose Computers This
type of computers are designed in
order to work in all environments.
They are versatile computers but are
not efficient and also consume a
large amount of time in generating
the results. e.g. ENIAC, desktops
etc.
● Special Purpose Computers They
are designed to perform only a
specified task. They are not versatile
and their speed and size depends on
the task. They are efficient and
consume less time in generating
results. e.g. ATM, aircraft controllers
etc.
On the Basis of Size and
Capability
● Micro Computers It is a digital
computer used by individuals and is
also considered as an acronym for
Personal Computers (PCs). They are
small in size. They are usually used
at homes, in schools and offices etc.
e.g. Laptop, Palmtop, Notebook,
Desktop etc.
● Mini Computers This type of computers
are more powerful than micro computers,
but less powerful than mainframe
computers. They are also termed as
mid-range computers.
● It is a multiprocessing system capable of
supporting 4 to about 200 users
simultaneously. e.g. IBM mid range
computers, K-202, SDS-92 etc.
● Mainframe Computers It is a very large
computer and is used for handling major
applications in large business organisations.
They can also be used as centralised
computers with several terminal users
connected to it. They can contain large
databases and are also known as super
servers.
● They can handle huge amount of
input/output (I/O) operations at the same
time. They are very expensive. e.g. Fujitsu’s
ICL VME, Hitachi’s Z800 etc.
● Super Computers It can be defined as the
most powerful computer in terms of
performance and storage capacity. They are
highly expensive and are employed for
specialised applications such as for weather
forecasting, several scientific researches etc.
● NASA (National Aeronautics for Space
Administration) uses super computers for
launching space shuttles, controlling them
and for space exploration purpose.
● PARAM is the first super computer in India.

Components of Computer
The computer system comprises of the
following four main components
1. Input Unit
It consists of those devices through which
user can enter the data into a computer. It
links a computer to the external
environment. It translates the data into
computers understandable form. Some input
devices are
● Keyboard is used to enter data or
information, which may be in numeric
form or alphabetical form, in a computer
system.
● Mouse is a pointing device which provides
a means to input data and commands in
graphic form by selecting through moving
an arrow called pointer.
● Trackball is another pointing device which
is an alternative to a mouse.
● Joystick is an input device that moves in all
directions and controls the movement of
the cursor.
● Scanner is an optical input device and
uses light as an input source to convert an
image into an electronic form that can be
stored on the computer.
● Touch Screen is an electronic visual
display that can detect the presence and
location of a touch within the display area.
2. Output Unit
This unit contains those devices that
provide the desired output (results) in
the human acceptable format.
Some output devices are
● Monitor is also known as Visual Display
Unit (VDU). The monitor is provided
along with the computer to view the
display result. The popular types of
monitor are
◆ LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), a special
type of liquid is sandwiched between
two plates. It is a thin, flat and light
weight screen made up of any number
of colour or monochrome pixels
arranged in front of a light source.
◆ LED (Liquid/Light Emitted Diode) is
an electronic device that emits light
when electrical current is passed
through it.
◆ TFT (Thin Film Transistor) is a LCD
with active-matrix displays, each pixel
is controlled by one to four transistors
that can make the screen faster,
brighter, more colorful than
passive-matrix and capable of being
viewed at different angles.
◆ 3-D Monitors describe an image that
provides the perception of length.
When 3-D images are made interactive
then user feel involved with the scene,
and this experience is called virtual
reality.

● Printer prints information and data
from the computer onto a paper. It can
print documents in colour as well as in
black and white.
● Plotter is a special kind of output
channel, like a printer, that produces
images on paper. They are mainly used
to produce large drawings or images.
● Speaker is an output device that
receives sound in the form of electric
current. It needs a sound card
connected to a CPU, that generates
sound.
3. CPU (Central Processing
Unit)
CPU is considered as the ‘Brain of
Computer’. It is responsible for all the
manipulations and processing of the
data provided to the computer. It is
further categorised basically into two
main components
● Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) This
unit performs both arithmetical and
logical operations. Arithmetic operations involves addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division etc and the
logical operations involves AND, OR,
NOT, NOR, NAND etc.
● Control Unit (CU) It is an important
part that instructs, maintains and
controls the flow of information but
does not store the data. It tells the
memory, ALU and I/O devices that
how they have to respond to the
program’s instructions.
4. Memory Unit
This unit stores the data and
instructions, intermediate results or the
processed data and thus, provides the
relevant information whenever required
by the other units of computer.
It consists of two types
● Primary Memory It is considered to
be the main memory of computer that
stores the data which is currently in
use by the computer.
● Types of Primary Memory:
◆ RAM (Random Access Memory) is a
volatile memory, which losses the data
when the power gets switched OFF.
There are basically two types of RAM:
Static RAM and Dynamic RAM.
◆ ROM (Read Only Memory) is a nonvolatile memory, which retains the data even
when the power gets switched OFF.
◆ Program and data that cannot be altered are
stored in ROM. There are basically three
types of ROM: Programmable ROM(PROM),
Erasable PROM(EPROM) and Electrically
EPROM(EEPROM).
● Secondary Memory The computer system
uses secondary memory to store data,
program instruction and information. It
stores the data permanently. User can
access or retrieve the data whenever
required. Types of Secondary Memory:
◆ Magnetic Tape (sequential access)
◆ Magnetic Disk (Floppy Disk, Hard Disk)
◆ Optical Disc (CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc)
◆ Solid State drive (Flash drive, SD cards)
Cache Memory
It is a type of memory used to hold the frequently
used data. It acts as a buffer between the CPU
and the main memory. It consumes less access
time as compared to main memory and thus, is
used to match up the speed of fast running
processor.
Registers
These are defined as the special memory units
used by the CPU to speed up the rate of accessing
information. There are some special type of
registers used for specific work.
e.g. Program Counter (PC) is used to hold the
address of the next instruction for execution.
Some other examples are Accumulator, Memory
Buffer Register (MBR), Instruction Register (IR) etc.
Hardware
It can be defined as the physical components
of a computer i.e. the parts that can be seen
and touched.
The four main categories of hardware are
● Input devices e.g. keyboard, mouse etc.
● Output devices e.g. printer,monitor etc.
● Storage devices e.g. hard disk, floppy disk etc.
● Processing devices e.g. CPU etc.
Software
The term software can be defined as the set of
programs and procedures that enable a
computer to perform a specific task or to
process the information. Software can be
classified into three types :
468 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 469
System Software
It is a set of one or more programs designed
to control the operations of a computer
system including hardware components
and implementations of application
software.
Types of System Software are
● Operating System It is a system
software, consisting of an integrated set
of programs that controls computer
resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices,
etc) and provides common services for
efficient execution of various application
software.
● Language Translator It helps in
converting programming languages to
machine language. There are three kinds
of language translator
◆ Assembler It converts program written in
assembly language into machine
language.
◆ Interpreter It converts a high level
language into machine language by
converting it line by line.
◆ Complier It also converts high level
language program into machine language
at one go.
Utility Software
It is a type of system software, which is used
to support, secure and enhance the existing
programs and data in the computer system.
It is also used to debug the software errors.
e.g. antivirus software, backup software etc.
Programming Language
It is a set of keywords, symbols and a system
of rules for constructing statements, by which
human can communicate, to be executed by a
computer.
Programming languages are mainly
categorised into two parts:
Low Level Languages These languages
are designed to operate and handle the entire
hardware and instruction set architecture of a
computer system directly. It is divided into
two parts:
■ Machine language, referred to as machine
code or object code, is a collection of binary
digits or bits that the computer reads and
interprets.
■ Assembly language uses structured
commands as substitutions for numbers,
allowing humans to read the code easier.
High Level Languages These languages
are not limited by the computer, designed for
a specific task and are easier to read, write
and understand. e.g. BASIC, C, FORTRAN,
JAVA etc.
Application Software
It is a set of one or more programs
designed to carry out operations for a
specific application. It cannot run on
itself, but it is dependent on system
software to get executed. It is written in
high level language.
Application Software What Does It Do? Examples
Word Processor Virtually all personal computers are
equipped with a word-processing program,
which has the same function as a type-writer
for writing letters, reports or other
documents and printings.
Microsoft Word,
WordPerfect
Spreadsheet A table containing text and figures, which is
used to perform calculations. Spreadsheets
are usually used for budgets, statistics and
so on.
Microsoft Excel,
Lotus 1-2-3
Database Management
System
Used for storing information, e.g. the names
and addresses of the clients.
Microsoft SQL Server,
Oracle
Accounting Program They generate extensive financial reports,
produce invoices and statements to
customers, handle accounts payable and
receivable, print payroll checks and payroll
reports and track inventories.
Tally (all versions)
Presentation Tool To create presentations by allowing one to
produce slides or handouts.
Microsoft PowerPoint
NETWORKING
Computer networking relates to the
communication between a group of two or
more computers linked together. When we
communicate on a network, we share
information or data through a
communication medium. E-mailing,
instant messaging and web pages all are
dependent on communication that take
place across an underlying computer
network.
Benefits of Networking
● Data and Fill sharing
● Software sharing
● Hardware sharing
● Reliability
Network Devices
These are required to amplyfy the signal to
restore the original strength of signal and to
provide an interface to connect multiple
computers in a network. Many types of
Network Devices
● Repeater is a device that amplifies the
signals when they are transported over a
long distance so that the signal can be as
strong as the original signal.
● Hub is like a repeater with multiple ports
used to connect the network channels.
● Gateway is an interconnecting device,
which joins two different network
protocols together.
● Switch forwards a data packet to a
specific route by establishing a temporary
connection between the source and the
destination.
● Bridge reduces the amount of traffic on a
LAN by dividing it into two segments.
● Modem is a device that converts digital
signal to analog signal and vice-versa.
Types of Computer Network
● Local Area Network (LAN) In this,
computers can be connected with a
geographical area spread over 1 km to
10 km or we can say within a same
building. All the terminals are
connected to a main computer called
server.
● Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) It
is a data network designed for a town or
city. Its main purpose is to share
hardware and software resources among
the various users.
● Wide Area Network (WAN) In this,
the computers are farther apart and are
connected by radiowaves. Such a
network may spread over countries.
Communication Media
Communication media of a network refer
to the transmission media or the
connecting media used in the network.
Transmission media can be divided into
two broad categories; guided and
unguided media.
● Guided Media or Wired Technologies
It consists of a cable composed of metals
like copper, tin or silver. Basically, these
are divided into three categories
◆ Ethernet Cable or Twisted Pair A
type of cable that consists of two
independently insulated wires twisted
around one another. The use of two
wires twisted together helps to reduce
crosstalk and electromagnetic
induction.
◆ Coaxial Cable A type of wire that
consists of a center wire surrounded by
insulation and then a grounded shield of
braided wire. The shield minimizes
electrical and radio frequency
interference.

● Unguided Media or Wireless
Technologies When the computers in a
network are interconnected and data is
transmitted through waves, then they are
said to be connected through unguided
media. Some commonly used unguided
media of transmission are
◆ Radio Wave Transmission There are
two principal ways in which
electromagnetic (radio) energy travels
from a transmitting antenna to a receiving
antenna. One way is by GROUND WAVES
that are radio waves that travel near the
surface of the Earth (surface and space
waves) and the other is by SKY WAVES that
are radio waves that are reflected back to
Earth from the ionosphere.
◆ Microwave Transmission It is the
transmission of information or energy by
electromagnetic waves whose wavelengths
are conveniently measured in small
numbers of centimeter; these are called
microwaves.
◆ Satellite Communication It provides
communication links between various
points on Earth. It covers a vast range of
area. It is very useful in television
transmission.
◆ Infrared Wave Transmission It refers to
energy in the region of the electromagnetic
radiation spectrum at wavelengths longer
than those of visible light, but shorter than
those of radio.
◆ Bluetooth It is a wireless technology
standard for exchanging data over short
distances from fixed and mobile devices

Official Language

Language of the Union
Hindi written in Devanagari script is to be the official
language of the Union.
The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of
the Union has to be the international form of Indian numerals
and not the Devanagari form of numerals.
Accordingly, in 1955, the president appointed an Official

The commission submitted its report to the President in
1956.
The Parliament enacted the Official Language Act in 1963.
The act provides for the continued use of English (even after 1965), in addition to
Hindi, for all official purposes of the Union and also for the transaction of business in
Parliament.
Notably, this act enables the use of English indefinitely (without any time-limit).
Further, this act was amended in 1967 to make the use of English, in addition to Hindi,
compulsory in certain cases

Part 7, Lokpal and
Lokayukta)
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

Lokpal and Lokayuktas
• ‘The success of democracy and the realisation of socio-economic
development depends on the extent to which the citizens’
grievances are redressed.’
• The institution of Ombudsman was first created in Sweden in 1809.
• ‘Ombud’ is a Swedish term and refers to a person who acts as the
representative or spokesman of another person.
• According to Donald C. Rowat, Ombudsman refers to “an officer
appointed by the legislature to handle complaints against
administrative and judicial action.”
• Spread to other Scandinavian countries.
• The United Kingdom adopted Ombudsman-like institution called Parliamentary
Commissioner for Administration in 1967. (New Zealand in 1962)
LOKPAL
• The 1st Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) of India (1966–1970) recommended the
setting up of two special authorities designated as ‘Lokpal’ and ‘Lokayuktas’.
 Lokpal - complaints against ministers and secretaries at Central and state levels
 Lokayuktas - complaints against other specified higher officials.
**The ARC kept the judiciary outside the purview of Lokpal and Lokayuktas as in New Zealand.
But, in Sweden the judiciary is within the purview of Ombudsman.
• 10 official attempts have been made to bring about legislation on this subject
by tabling bills in Parliament
• Finally, the LOKPAL AND LOKAYUKTAS ACT (2013) was passed in December
2013 and effective from January 2014
2011 – Anna hazare led
 Lokpal movement
The salient features of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (2013)
1. Lokpal at the Centre
 Lokayukta at the State level

The jurisdiction of Lokpal includes the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of
Parliament and Groups A, B, C and D officers and officials of the Central
Government.
2. The Lokpal to consist of a Chairperson with a maximum of 8 members of which
50% shall be judicial members.
3. 50% of the members of the Lokpal shall come from amongst the SCs, the STs,
the OBCs, minorities and women.
4. Selection Committee -
Prime Minister
Speaker of the Lok Sabha
Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
CJI or a sitting SC Judge nominated by him (CJI)
An eminent jurist - to be nominated by President on the basis of
recommendations of the first 4 members of the selection committee
The following persons cannot become chairperson of Lokpal:
• MPs and MLAs
• Persons convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude
• Less than 45 years of age
• Members of Panchayats or Municipality
• A person who was removed or dismissed from the public service
• A person who holds any office of trust / profit; if so, he would need to
resign from Lok Sabha
• A person who is affiliated to a political party
• Carries on some business / profession; if so, he would need to quit some
business
• The term of office for Lokpal Chairman and Members is 5 years or till
attaining age of 70 years.
• The salary, allowances and other conditions of service of
chairperson are equivalent to Chief Justice of India and members is
equivalent to Judge of Supreme Court.
LOKAYUKTAS
• Even much before the enactment of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (2013)
itself, many states had already set up the institution of Lokayuktas.
First Lokayukta was created in Maharashtra*
• Appointed by the governor of the state.
• While appointing, the governor in most of the states consults (a) the chief
justice of the state high court, and (b) the leader of Opposition in the state
legislative assembly
• In most of the states, the term of office fixed for Lokayukta is of 5 years
duration or 65 years of age,
1. The Lokayukta presents, annually, to the governor of the state a
consolidated report on his performance. The governor places this report
along with an explanatory memorandum before the state legislature.
The Lokayukta is responsible to the state legislature.
2. He takes the help of the state investigating agencies for conducting
inquiries.
3. He can call for relevant files and documents from the state government
departments.
4. The recommendations made by the Lokayukta are only advisory and not
binding on the state government.

ATOMS AND
MOLECULES
By Dr Vipan Goyal

ELEMENTS
• Elements are chemically the simplest and pure substances and
hence cannot be broken down using chemical methods.
ATOMS
• The smallest particles of a chemical element that can exist or the building blocks of
all matter are atoms.
 (i) Hydrogen, H (ii) Aluminium, Al (iii) Cobalt, Co
 Atom is the smallest particle of a matter that takes part in chemical reactions,
but cannot exist in free state.
 Atom is made of electrons, protons and neutrons.
 Protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus (at the centre of atom) whereas
electrons revolve around the nucleus.
 Atoms combine to form molecules, the smallest part of matter which can exist
in free state.
MOLECULES
• A molecule can be defined as the smallest particle of an element or
a compound that is capable of an independent existence and shows
all the properties of that substance.
• Atoms of the same element or of different elements can join
together to form molecules.
• Ex – Sulphur molecule (S8), Hydrogen molecule(H2)
MOLECULES
• Ex – Sulphur molecule (S8), Hydrogen molecule(H2)
COMPOUNDS
• Atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions to
form molecules of compounds. Ex- H2O, CO2, BeCl2, BF3.
DALTON’S ATOMIC THEORY
• States that
 Atom is the smallest unit of an atom
 Nothing is smaller than an atom
• Rejected as later it was discovered by Rutherford, that there are
substances which are smaller than atom.
RUTHERFORD’S GOLD FOIL EXPERIMENT
• Rutherford designed an experiment for this. In this experiment, fast
moving alpha (α)-particles were made to fall on a thin gold foil.
• He selected a gold foil because he wanted as thin a layer as
possible. This gold foil was about 1000 atoms thick.
• α-particles are doubly-charged helium ions. Since they have a mass
of 4 u, the fast-moving α-particles have a considerable amount of
energy.
• It was expected that α-particles would be deflected by the subatomic particles in the gold atoms.
RUTHERFORD’S GOLD FOIL EXPERIMENT
• Since the α-particles were much heavier than the protons, he did
not expect to see large deflections.
• But, the α-particle scattering experiment gave totally unexpected
results. The following observations were made:
 (i) Most of the fast moving α-particles passed straight through
the gold foil.
 (ii) Some of the α-particles were deflected by the foil by small
angles.
RUTHERFORD’S GOLD FOIL EXPERIMENT
• (iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000 particles appeared to
rebound
• Rutherford concluded from the α-particle scattering experiment
that–
 (i) Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of
the α-particles passed through the gold foil without getting
deflected.
RUTHERFORD’S GOLD FOIL EXPERIMENT
 (ii) Very few particles were deflected from their path,
indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very
little space.
 (iii) A very small fraction of α-particles were deflected,
indicating that all the positive charge and mass of the gold
atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the
atom. From the data he also calculated that the radius of the
nucleus is about 10^5 times less than the radius of the atom.
RESULTS OF HIS EXPERIMENT
• (i) There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the
nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus.
• (ii) The electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular paths.
• (iii) The size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of
the atom.
RUTHERFORD’S GOLD FOIL EXPERIMENT
DRAWBACKS
• The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit is not expected to
be stable. Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo
acceleration.
• During acceleration, charged particles would radiate energy. Thus,
the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the
nucleus.
• If this were so, the atom should be highly unstable and hence
matter would not exist in the form that we know.
BOHR’S MODEL OF AN ATOM
• To overcome the objections raised against Rutherford’s model of
the atom, Neils Bohr put forward the following postulates about the
model of an atom:
 Only certain special orbits known as discrete orbits of electrons,
are allowed inside the atom.
 While revolving in discrete orbits the electrons do not radiate
energy.
 These orbits or shells are called energy levels.
 A few energy levels in an atom
BOHR’S MODEL OF AN ATOM
• These orbits or shells are represented by the letters K,L,M,N,… or
the numbers, n=1,2,3,4,….
• The maximum number of electron a shell can accomodate is
represented by 2 (n^2). Where n = no. of shells. Therefore,
maximum electrons in
 K shell= 2
 L shell =8
 M shell = 18
 N shell = 32
ORBITALS
• The orbits in which electrons
move are called orbitals. There
are four orbitals as S,p,d,f.
• The maximum number of an
electron, an orbital contains: S(2),
P(6), D(10), F(14).
• The electronic configuration of
Na = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1
Electrons, Protons and Neutrons
• ELECTRON
 The negatively charged particles which revolves around the
nucleus. The charge on an electron is 1.6 × 10-19 coulombs. It
was discovered by JJ Thomson.
• PROTON
 The subatomic particles present in the nucleus with positive
charge is called proton. It was discovered by Goldstein.
Electrons, Protons and Neutrons
• NEUTRON
 A particle with no charge
(neither positive nor
negative) and is present in
nucleus is called neutron.
 It appears in the nucleus of
all atoms except hydrogen. It
was discovered by
Chadwick.
STRUCTURE OF ATOM
Charge Mass Location
Proton +1 1 Nucleus
Neutron 1 1 Nucleus
Electron -1 0 Orbitals
Atomic number
The number of protons or the number of electrons in an element is called
atomic number. It is denoted by Z.


MASS NUMBER
• It is the sum of number of proton/electron and number of
neutron.
ISOBARS
• They are atoms of different elements having the same atomic mass
but different atomic number.
ISOTOPES
• These are the elements having same atomic number but different
mass number.
ISOTONES
• Two nuclides are isotones if they have the very same neutron
number N, but different proton number.
• Example, boron-12 and carbon-13 nuclei both contain 7 neutrons,
and so are isotones
Dating Techniques
• Radiocarbon dating is used to determine the age of carbon
bearing materials like wood, animal fossils etc.
• Uranium dating is used to determine the age of Earth,
minerals and rocks.
Electrons Distributed in Different
Orbits (Shells)
• The maximum number of electrons that can be present in a shell is
given by the formula 2n
2
.
• ‘n’ is the orbit number or energy level index, i.e. 1, 2, 3,….
• According to the given formula −
 First orbit i.e. K-shell will be = 2 × 1
2 = 2
 Second orbit i.e. L-shell will be = 2 × 2
2 = 8
 Third orbit i.e. M-shell will be = 2 × 3
2 = 18
 Fourth orbit i.e. N-shell will be = 2 × 4
2 = 32
Electrons Distributed in Different
Orbits (Shells)
• Likewise, the maximum number of electrons that can be
accommodated in the outermost orbit is 8.
• Electrons are not filled in a given shell, unless the inner shells are
filled. It means, the shells are filled in a step-wise manner; starting
from inner shell to outer shell.
VALENCY
• The combining capacity of an element is called valency. It
represents both the number of electrons that an element can either
gain or lose.
• Example, oxygen has valency 2, carbon has valency 4.

Periodic table
• GROUP
 It is a column of elements in the
periodic table of the chemical
elements. There are 18
numbered groups in the periodic
table.
• PERIOD
 In each period (horizontal row),
the atomic numbers increase
from left to right. The periods
are numbered 1 through 7 on
the left-hand side of the table.
Elements that are in the same
period have chemical properties
that are not all that similar.
Periodic table
• Group 1 ALKALI METALS
 Readily lose their one
outermost electrons to form
cations with a 1+ charge.
 They have low melting and
boiling points compared to
most other metals.
 They are very soft and can be
cut easily with a knife.
 React with water readily
readily to form hydroxides
Periodic table
• Group 2 ALKALINE EARTH
METALS
 Silvery white
 Readily lose their two
outermost electrons to form
cations with a 2+ charge
 Low densities
 Low melting points
 Low boiling points
Periodic table
• Group 17 HALOGENS
 Halogens means salt
forming
 Easily gain one electron
to become noble gases
or become stable
 Have valency 1 (one).
Uses of Chlorine
• Chlorine is a disinfectant – it kills bacteria, it is used to kill bacteria
in drinking water and swimming pools.
• Chlorine dissolved in sodium hydroxide solution is bleach. It forms
sodium chlorate(I) –NaOCl.
• Domestic bleach contains about 5% NaOCl(sodium chlorate)
• Chlorine is used in the manufacture of many chemicals including
insecticides, CFCs and the polymer PVC(poly vinyl chloride).
Uses of Iodine
• Iodine can also be used as an antiseptic to kill bacteria.
• An antiseptic is safe to use on the skin to help prevent infection but
a disinfectant will damage skin cells.
• Iodine dissolved in alcohol (ethanol) was commonly used as an
antiseptic in the past. It was called “Tincture of iodine”.
• Iodine is necessary for proper functioning of THYROID GLAND.
• Iodine deficiency causes Goitre.
Uses of Fluoride and Bromide
• What are the uses of FLUORIDE?
 Fluorides are added to toothpaste and in some places added to
drinking water. It has been shown that fluorides can reduce dental
decay (damage to teeth) especially in young children.
• What are the uses of BROMIDE?
 Silver bromide is used in photographic film.
 Silver bromide is almost white, and when light falls on it, it splits up
into silver metal and bromine. The silver metal appears as a black
mark on the film, producing a black and white (monochrome)
negative.
GROUP 18 OR GROUP 0/NOBLE GASES
GROUP 18 OR GROUP 0/NOBLE GASES
• Physical properties
 Colorless, odorless gases at room temperature
• Chemical properties
 very stable
 does not react with other elements except Xenon
 outer electron shell is full
USES OF NOBLE GASES
• HELIUM
 It is much less dense (lighter) than air and is used in balloons
and blimps. Because of its inertness, it doesn’t burn in air.
 A mixture of helium and oxygen is used in place of natural air for
divers and others who work under high air pressure.
 Helium has the lowest boiling point of any known substances,
4.1 K
• KRYPTON
 It is used in fluorescene bulbs, flash bulbs and lasers.
USES OF NOBLE GASES
• NEON
 Neon is a chemical element with symbol Ne and atomic number
10. It is a noble gas. Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert
monatomic gas under standard conditions. The brilliant red glow
is caused by the passage of electric current through neon gas
under low pressure.
• XENON
 It is used in fluorescent bulbs, flash bulbs and lasers. Xenon
emits an instant, intense light when present in discharge tubes.
USES OF NOBLE GASES
• ARGON
 Argon, like all the noble gases is chemically inert. It is used in
filament bulbs because the metal filament will not burn in argon
(i.e., argon prevents the oxidation of the hot filament, thereby
prolonging its life)
• RADON
 It is radioactive and is used in medicine as a source of gamma
rays. The gas is sealed in small capsules, which are implanted in
the body to destroy malignant cancerous growths.
ATOMIC SIZE
• The size of an atom depends
upon its nuclear
charge(Increases as the number
of outer electron increases and
viceversa) and the number of
shells.
• It increases as we go down
along the group due to increase
number of shell and decreases
as we go along the period due
to increase nuclear charge.
IONIZATION POTENTIAL
• Amount of energy required to remove
an electron from an isolated atom or
molecule and make it in the form of
ion, is called ionization potential.
• It is larger for smaller molecule as the
electron is attracted towards the
nucleus when it is close to it or the
number of shells are less and viceversa.
So, it is basically depends upon :
 Number of shells
 Nuclear charge (Increases as the
number of outer electron increases
and viceversa)
ELECTRONEGATIVITY
• ELECTRONEGATIVITY is a measure
of the tendency of an atom to
attract a bonding pair of electrons.
• Fluorine is the most
electronegative element.
• It basically depends upon the
number of electron in the outer
shell. It increases as the number of
outer electron increases which is
when we move across the period
from left to right. So, the non
metals are electronegative. While
the metals are electropositive.
ELECTRONEGATIVITY
• Cl + e- Cl-
• Properties of elements Behavior
along periods Behavior along
groups
• Atomic size Decreases from left
to right Increases from up to
down
• Ionization potential Increases
from left to right Decreases
down the group
• Electronegativity Increases from
left to right Decreases from up
to down
IONIC BOND
• Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the
electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the
primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds.
COVALENT BOND
• A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond
that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These
electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the
stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms,
when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding.
Oxidation and Reduction Reactions
• OXIDATION REACTIONS
 Oxidation reaction is when
a species:
o Gains Oxygen
o Loses Hydrogen
o Loses Electrons
• REDUCTION REACTIONS
 Reduction reaction is when
a species:
o Loses Oxygen
o Gains Hydrogen
o Gains electrons
Oxidation and Reduction Reactions
REDOX REACTIONS
• Redox reactions are reactions where reduction and/ or oxidation
occurs during the chemical reaction.
REDOX REACTIONS
DECOMPOSITION REACTION
• A decomposition reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which a single
compound breaks down into two or more elements or new compounds.
• These reactions often involve an energy source such as heat, light, or
electricity that breaks part the bonds of compounds.
• Ex - Ferrous sulphate crystals (FeSO4, 7H2O) lose water when heated and
the colour of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide
(Fe2O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a
solid, while SO2 and SO3 are gases.
COMBINATION REACTION
• A reaction in which a single product is formed from two or more
reactants is known as a combination reaction.
DISPLACEMENT REACTION
• The reaction in which a more reactive element replaces a less
reactive element from its compound.
• Both metals and non metals take part in displacement reactions.
NEUTRALISATION REACTION
• A neutralisation reaction is when an acid and a base react to form
water and a salt and involves the combination of H+ ions and OHions to generate water.
REVERSIBLE REACTION
• It is a chemical reaction that results in an equilibrium mixture of
reactants and products.
IRREVERSIBLE REACTION
• In these reactions, the reactants react to form the products, which cannot
revert back into reactants.
 Heat transfer through a finite temperature difference
 Friction, Plastic deformation
 Flow of electric current through a resistance
 Magnetization or polarization with a hysteresis
 Unrestrained expansion of fluids
 Spontaneous chemical reactions
 Spontaneous mixing of matter of varying composition/states
Corrosion and Rancidity
• Corrosion
 When a metal is attacked by substances found in the immediate environment, such
as moisture, acids, etc., it is known as corrosion. E.g. the black coating on silver, the
green coating on copper, etc.,
 • The oxidative deterioration of a metal surface by the action of environment is
called corrosion, an electrochemical process. • When iron exposed in to air, iron
surface turns brown due to the formation of hydrated ferric oxide (Fe203.xH20)
which is also called rust, • Silver - Surface turns black due to the formation of silver
sulphide (Ag2S)
• Rancidity
 When fats and oils are getting oxidized, the process is known as rancidity. Their
smell, taste, color, etc. also change; likewise, it made food unsafe for consumption.

Nature of Indian
Economy
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Structure and Key Features
• Since independence India has been a 'Mixed Economy'. India's
large public sectors were responsible for rendering the country a
'mixed economy' feature.
• Indian economy is basically based in the contribution of service
sector (currently provides 54.40% share of GDP) and near about
50% of its population is dependent on the Agriculture.
• As soon as the time is passing, the share of Agriculture is
decreasing and share of service sector is increasing. Currently India
is called a developing economy of the world.
Features of Indian Economy
• Since independence India has been a 'mixed economy'. India's large
public sectors were responsible for providing employment and
revenue to the economy.
• Indian economy overview was highly inspired by Soviet Union's
practices post-independence. It had been recording growth rate not
greater than five jumped till 1980s. This stagnant growth was
termed by many economists as 'Hindu Growth Rate'. (result of
socialist policies implemented by the then staunch secular
governments and had nothing to do with Hinduism)
Features of Indian Economy
• In 1992, the country ushered into liberalization regime.
Thereafter, the economy started scaling upward. This new
trend in growth was called 'New Hindu Growth Rate'.
• India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of
modern industries and a multitude of services.
• Services are the major source of economic growth, accounting
for more than half of India's output with less than one third of
its labour force.
Planned economy
• This type of economic system is characterized by centralized planning and
control of economic activities by the government. The state decides how
to use and distribute resources according to the needs of people.
• All major decisions related to the production, distribution, commodity and
service prices, are all made by the government. The government
regulates prices and wages. It may even determine what sorts of work
individuals do. Market forces have very little say in such an economy. It
lacks the kind of flexibility that is present a market economy.
• Socialism is a type of command economic system. This kind of economy
was found in Soviet Union before its disintegration in 1991.
Market economy or Free enterprise economy
• The main features of this type of economy include private property, freedom of
enterprise, profit motive, competition among enterprises, absence of central
planning and absence of government interference.
• Market economies run on the basis of principle of laissez-faire that is minimum
or no interference by the government in the economy. Organizations run by the
people determine how the economy runs, how supply is generated, what
demands are necessary, etc. Market decisions are mainly dominated by supply
and demand.
• The role of the government in a market economy is to simply make sure that the
market is stable enough to carry out its economic activities properly. Within a
pure market economy the government is entirely absent from economic affairs.
Pure market economy is not seen in the world now-a-days.
India as Mixed Economy
• Early on at the outset itself, independent India chose to adopt
a mixed approach instead of veering either towards an
economy wholly determined by market forces or an economy
wholly and only controlled by the state.
• The Indian Constitution itself expresses the hope that India
will function as a welfare state, and to do so would require
state intervention and hence, a mixed approach was followed.
State economy
• Even though the emphasis on planning in India was inspired from
the USSR, India could not adopt an economic model similar to the
command economy in USSR since India was built on democratic
principles.
• Therefore, a proactive governmental force was required to set right
the wrongs and rive economic growth and industralisation.
• Such a monumental task couldn’t be completely left to the hands of
private players.
Mixed economy
• In the initial years, the public sector played a prominent role driven
by need for public ownership of means of production.
• As the flaws of this were revealed over the years, the public sector’s
sphere of influence was restricted, and private players began
playing a more prominent role.
• However, even though the extent of the role played by the private
sector and the public sector varied in time, India’s economy has
always witnessed co-existence of the two.
• Hence, over time, India evolved its own unique brand of mixed
economy that was suitable to its indigenous conditions and
requirements.
Economic Sectors
• Economic activities result in the production of goods and
services while sectors are the group of economic activities
classified on the basis of some criteria.
• The Indian economy can be classified into various sectors on
the basis of ownership, working conditions and the nature of
the activities.

Economic Sectors
• All economic activity was in the primary sector during early
civilization. After the surplus production of food, people’s
need for other products increased which led to the
development of the secondary sector.
• The growth of secondary sector spread its influence during
the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century.
• A support system was needed to facilitate the industrial
activity. Certain sectors like transport and finance played an
important role in supporting the industrial activity.

Primary Sector
• In Primary sector of economy, activities are undertaken
by directly using natural resources. Agriculture, Mining,
Fishing, Forestry, Dairy etc. are some examples of this sector.
• It is called so because it forms the base for all other products.
Since most of the natural products we get are from
agriculture, dairy, forestry, fishing, it is also called Agriculture
and allied sector.
• People engaged in primary activities are called red-collar
workers due to the outdoor nature of their work.
Secondary Sector
• It includes the industries where finished products are made
from natural materials produced in the primary sector.
Industrial production, cotton fabric, sugar cane production
etc. activities comes under this sector.
• Hence its the part of a country's economy that manufactures
goods, rather than producing raw materials
• Since this sector is associated with different kinds of
industries, it is also called industrial sector.
Secondary Sector
• People engaged in secondary activities are called blue collar
workers.
• Examples of manufacturing sector:
 Small workshops producing pots, artisan production.
 Mills producing textiles,
 Factories producing steel, chemicals, plastic, car.
 Food production such as brewing plants, and food processing.
 Oil refinery.
Core Industries
• Eight Core Industries are Electricity, steel, refinery products,
crude oil, coal, cement, natural gas and fertilizers.
• The Index of Eight Core Industries is a monthly production
index, which is also considered as a lead indicator of the
monthly industrial performance.
Tertiary Sector/Service Sector
• This sector’s activities help in the development of the primary
and secondary sectors. By itself, economic activities in tertiary
sector do not produce a goods but they are an aid or a
support for the production.
• Goods transported by trucks or trains, banking, insurance,
finance etc. come under the sector. It provides the value
addition to a product same as secondary sector.
• This sector jobs are called white collar jobs.
• Services sector is the largest sector of India in 2018-19.
• Services sector accounts for 54.40% of GDP.
• Industry sector contributes 29.73%.
• While, Agriculture and allied sector shares 15.87%.
Pink Collar Worker
• Pink-collar worker is one who is employed in a job that is traditionally
considered to be women's work.
• The term pink-collar worker was used to distinguish female-orientated
jobs from the blue-collar worker, a worker in manual labor, and the whitecollar worker, a professional or educated worker in office positions.
• A pink collar worker need not require as much professional training as
white-collar professions. They do not get equal pay or prestige.
• Some examples of pink collar occupations are baby sitter, florist, day care
worker, nurses etc.
Sunrise Industry
• Sunrise industry is a term used for a sector that is just in its infancy
but shows promise of a rapid boom.
• The industry is typically characterized by high growth rates, high
degree of innovation and generally has plenty of public awareness
about the sector and investors get attracted to its long-term growth
prospects.
• On the other hand Sunrise industry rapid emergence may threaten
a competing industry sector that is already in decline. Because of its
dim long-term prospects, such an industry is referred to as a sunset
industry.
Sunrise Industry
• Existing Indian sectors that can be termed as Sunrise sectors
and likely to hold us in good stead in the future in terms of
employment generation and business growth are:
• Information Technology
• Telecom Sector
• Healthcare
• Infrastructure Sector
• Retail Sector
• Food Processing Industries
• Fisheries
Quaternary Activities
• These are specialized tertiary activities in the ‘Knowledge
Sector’ which demands a separate classification.
• The quaternary sector is the intellectual aspect of the economy. It is
the process which enables entrepreneurs to innovate and improve
the quality of services offered in the economy.
• Personnel working in office buildings, elementary schools and
university classrooms, hospitals and doctors’ offices, theatres,
accounting and brokerage firms all belong to this category of
services.
Quinary Activities
• The quinary sector is the part of the economy where the toplevel decisions are made. This includes the government which
passes legislation. It also comprises the top decision-makers
in industry, commerce and also the education sector.
• These are services that focus on the creation, rearrangement and interpretation of new and existing
ideas; data interpretation and the use and evaluation of new
technologies.
Quinary Activities
• Profession under this category often referred as 'gold collar'
professions, they represent another subdivision of the
tertiary sector representing special and highly paid skills of
senior business executives, government officials, research
scientists, financial and legal consultants, etc.

Organised Sector
• In this sector, employment terms are fixed and regular, and
the employees get assured work and social security.
• It can also be defined as a sector, which is registered with the
government and a number of acts apply to the enterprises.
Schools and hospitals are covered under the organised sector.
• Workers in the organised sector enjoy security of
employment. They are expected to work only a fixed number
of hours. If they work more, they have to be paid overtime by
the employer.
Unorganised Sector
• An unorganised worker is a home-based worker or a selfemployed worker or a wage worker in the unorganized sector
and includes a worker in the organized sector who is not
covered by any of the Acts pertaining to welfare Schemes as
mentioned in Schedule-II of Unorganized Workers Social
Security Act, 2008.
• In this sector wage-paid labour is largely non-unionised due to
casual and seasonal nature of employment and scattered
location of enterprises.
Unorganised Sector
• The sector is marked by low incomes, unstable and irregular
employment, and lack of protection either from legislation or
trade unions.
• The unorganised sector uses mainly labour intensive and
indigenous technology. The workers in unorganised sector, are
so scattered that the implementation of the Legislation is very
inadequate and ineffective. There are hardly any unions in this
sector to act as watch-dogs.
Unorganised Sector
• But the contributions made by the unorganised sector to the
national income, is very substantial as compared to that of the
organised sector. It adds more than 60% to the national
income while the contribution of the organised sector is
almost half of that depending on the industry.

The Public Sector
• In the sector, government owns most of the assets and it is
the part of the economy concerned with providing various
governmental services.
• The purpose of the public sector is not just to earn profits.
• Governments raise money through taxes and other ways to
meet expenses on the services rendered by it.
Classification of Central Public Sector
Enterprises (CPSEs)
• CPSEs are classified into 3 categories-
 Maharatna,
 Navratna and
 Miniratna.
Maharatna Scheme
• Maharatna Scheme was introduced for Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), with
effect from 19th May, 2010, in order to empower mega CPSEs to expand their operations
and emerge as global giants.
• Presently there are eight ‘Maharatna’ CPSEs, viz.
• (i) Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, (BHEL)
• (ii) Coal India Limited, (CIL)
• (iii) Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL),
• (iv) Indian Oil Corporation Limited, (IOCL)
• (v) National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC ),
• (vi) Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Limited, (ONGC)
• (vii)Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL)
• (viii) Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)
Maharatna Scheme
• CPSEs fulfilling the following criteria are eligible to be
considered for grant of Maharatna status:
• Three years with an average annual net profit of over Rs. 2500
crore, OR
• Average annual Net worth of Rs. 10,000 crore for 3 years, OR
• Average annual Turnover of Rs. 20,000 crore for 3 years
(against Rs 25,000 crore prescribed earlier)
'Miniratna' Scheme
• The Miniratna Category – I and Schedule ‘A’ CPSEs, which have
obtained ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ rating under the
Memorandum of Understanding system in three of the last
five years, and have composite score of 60 or above in the six
selected performance parameters.
'Miniratna' Scheme
• 'Miniratna' Scheme: In October 1997, the Government had
also decided to grant enhanced autonomy and delegation of
financial powers to some other profit making companies
subject to certain eligibility conditions and guidelines to make
them efficient and competitive. These companies called
‘Miniratnas’, are in two Category-II. The eligibility conditions
and criteria are:
'Miniratna' Scheme
• Category –I CPSEs should have made profit in the last three
years continuously, the pre-tax profit should have been Rs. 30
crore or more in at least one of the three years and should
have a positive net worth.
• Category-II CPSEs should have made profit for the last three
years continuously and should have a positive net worth.
The Private Sector
• In the private sector, ownership of assets and delivery of
services is in the hands of private individuals or companies.
• It is sometimes referred as the citizen sector, which is run by
private individuals or groups, usually as a means of enterprise
for profit, and is not controlled but regulate by the State.
• Activities in the private sector are guided by the motive to
earn profits. To get such services we have to pay money to
these individuals and companies.
PPP (Public Private Partnership)
• PPP is an arrangement between government and private
sector for the provision of public assets and/or public
services.
• In this type of partnership investments being undertaken by
the private sector entity, for a specified period of time.
• As PPP involves full retention of responsibility by the
government for providing the services it doesn’t amount to
privatization.
PPP (Public Private Partnership)
• There is a well defined allocation of risk between the private sector
and the public entity.
• Private entity is chosen on the basis of open competitive bidding
and receives performance linked payments.
• PPP route can be alternative in developing countries where
governments faced various constraints on borrowing money for
important projects.
• It can also give required expertise in planning or executing large
projects.

Arab and Turkish Invasions
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Prophet Muhammad (570-632 A.D)
 He is the founder of Islam. In 570-571 AD, in the Arabian city
of Mecca, Islamic Prophet of God Hazarat Muhammad was
born in a Quarish Family.
 At the age of 25, he married a 40 years Old Khadijah bint
Khuwaylid. She was the first Muslim to embrace (after
Muhammad) Islam.
 In 622 AD, Muhammad migrated to Medina and this event is
called Hijra, marking the beginning of Islamic Calendar.
 So, derived from Hijra, the calendar is called Hijri Calender.
 The number of followers increased and in 630 AD
Muhammad returned to Mecca and established his
eminence. When he died in 632 AD, Islam had started
propagating.
Arab Invasion in India
• Muhammad-bin-Qasim
 Al-Hajjajj, the Governor of Iraq sent his nephew
Muhammad-bin-Qasim to India
 He Conquered Sind with the permission of Caliph Walid
• Battle of Rewar fought between Muhammad-bin-Qasim
and Dahir (a Brahmin) the ruler of Sind
• Dahir was defeated. Sind and Multan was captured.
• Muhammad-bin-Qasim called Multan as ‘The City of Gold’.
• Arab conquest of Sindh resulted in spread of Islam to North
India.
• The wife of Dahir Rani Bai and the other women of Sind put up a
heroic defense within the Fort of Rewar.
Administrative System
• But Islam was first introduced by Malik
Ibn Dinar in Kerlala in 644 A.D.
• Sind and Multan were divided into number
of Iqtas or districts by Muhammad-binQasim and Arab military officers headed
the Iqtas.
• The sub-divisions of the districts were
administered by the local Hindu Officers.
• Jizya was imposed on non-Muslims.
End of Muhammad-bin-Qasim
• Caliph Walid was succeeded by Caliph Sulaiman.
• He was an enemy of Al-Hajjaj, the Governor of Iraq.
• Muhammad-bin Qasim was the son-in-law of Al-Hajjaj, so he dismissed him and
sent to Mesopotamia as a prisoner where he was tortured to death.
• For more than 150 years, Sind and Multan continued to remain as the part of the
Caliph’s Empire.
Effects of Arab Conquest
• The subjugation of Sind made way for Islam into India.
• The art of administration, astronomy, music, painting, medicine and
architecture were learnt by Arabs from our land and they spread
astronomy, Indian Philosophy, and numerals to Europe.
The Turkish Invasion in India
• Subuktgin (986-997)
 The ruler of Khurussan and Ghazni,
Subuktgin, conquered India in AD 986-987.
 King Jai Pal got frightened on seeing his
large army.
 He made peace with him and offered
money, elephants and few forts.
 Later, he broke his promise and refused to
hand him over what he had promised.
The Turkish Invasion in India
 Subuktgin defeated Jai Pal in
Lamghan but soon died in 997.
 Mahmud of Ghazni became his
successor.
 In the 8th and 9th centuries, the
Turks dominated the Caliphs of
Baghdad
 They extended their dominion
beyond Sind and Multan into India
and finished the work begun by
the Arabs.
Indian Impact

 Mahmud’s significant invasion in Hindustan was
against the Somnath temple in 1025 A.D., located
on the coast of Kathiawar and Raja Bhima Dev the
ruler of Kathiawar and his followers escaped from
the place.
Mahmud of Ghazni’s Character Estimation
• Mahmud of Ghazni was one of the greatest Muslim rulers of Asia.

ACIDS, BASES AND
METALLOIDS
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Acid and Base
• ACID
 An acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+)in
aqueous solutions.
 Ex:- Hydrochloric acid (HCL) ,Acetic acid (CH3COOH).
• BASE
 A substance that releases hydroxide ions (OH¯) in aqueous
solutions.
 Ex:- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), NH4OH.
ACIDS ON BASES ON PH SCALE
• PH scale – The negative logarithm of H+ ions is called PH scale. It ranges
from negative to 14th value.
• STRONG / WEAK ACID: The acids having ph ranges less than 2 are
considered as strong acid and more than 2 are considered as weak acid or
the acidity decreases from left to right in a PH scale. Ex- CH3COOH is a
weak acid while HCl is a strong base.
• STRONG BASE / WEAK BASE: The base which have ph range 7 to 14 are
considered as base. The basicity increases from 7 to 14. The strongest
bases has the ph of 14. Ex- NH4OH is a weak base while NaOH is a strong
base.

• Acids
• These are the substance, which have sour taste and turn blue litmus red.
• These are good conductor of electricity in aqueous solution.
• Pickels are always kept in glass jar because acid present in them reacts with metal
to produce hydrogen gas.
• Bases
• These are the substances, which have bitter taste and turn red litmus, blue.
• They give different colours in acid and base solutions.
• Salts
• These are the product of neutralisation reaction between an acid and a base.
• pH is the measure of acidity/basicity.
BUFFER SOLUTION
• A solution whose ph does not change when small amount of an
acid or a base is added to it.
• Example: Blood contains a buffer of carbonic acid (H 2CO 3) and
bicarbonate anion (HCO 3 -) in order to maintain blood pH between
7.35 and 7.45, as a value higher than 7.8 or lower than 6.8 can lead
to death.
• In this buffer, hydronium H3O+ and bicarbonate anion HCO3
- are in
equilibrium with carbonic acid.
INDICATORS
INDICATORS
• Litmus is a water-soluble mixture of different dyes extracted from lichens.
• It is often adsorbed onto filter paper to produce one of the oldest forms of
pH indicator, used to test materials for acidity.
• Adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid
or dissolved solid to a surface. This process creates a film of the adsorbate
on the surface of the adsorbent.
• Phenolphthalein is basically used in acid base titrations (also used for
alcohol check while driving.)

• HCL – Hydrochloric Acid
• Vitamin C – Ascorbic Acid
• Uric Acid – Urine Of Birds
• Lactic Acid – Urine Of Birds
• Lactic Acid – Muscles (During Anaerobic Respiration)
• Butyric acid- Rancid butter
• Tarteric acid – Grapes
• Carbonic Acid- Sodawater
• Amino Acid – Proteins
• Oxalic acid is used to remove rust spots.
• HCl is used as bathroom cleaner.
 AQUA-REGIA: It contains the mixture of acids and bases in the ratio of 3:1. (HCl : HNO3)
Usually used by goldsmiths to dissolve gold.
Uses of some bases
• Aluminium hydroxide : used to make gastric medicine (antacid)
• Calcium hydroxide : used in sewage treatment
• Sodium hydroxide : used in manufacturing of Soaps, detergents and
cleaners.
• Magnesium hydroxide : used as an antacid, used as antiperspirant
armpit deodorant
• Ammonia : Production of fertilisers, in nitric acid manufacturing,
neutralise acid in petroleum industry and prevent premature
coagulation in natural/synthetic latex.
• Latex is used in mattresses, gloves, swim caps, catheters and
ballons etc.
Important facts of acids and bases
• Ant or bee contains methanoic or formic acid, due to which
victim feel pain and irritation. Use of mild base like baking
soda is a remedy of it.
• Excessive use of fertilisers makes the soil more acidic. To
neutralise it, quicklime is added to soil as acidic soil is not
good for the growth of plant.
• Pickles are always kept in glass jar because acid present in
them reacts with the metal of metallic pot.
Importance of pH in Everyday Life
• The pH value of a human body ranges between 7.0 and 7.8.
• The stomach of a human body produces hydrochloric acid that helps in the
digestion of food; surprisingly, it does not harm the stomach anyway.
However, when the stomach produces too much acid (known as
indigestion), it causes pain and irritation.
• To get relief from this pain, doctors suggest the use of bases known as
antacids. These antacids neutralize and control the increased amount of
acid.
• The teeth, which are made up of calcium phosphate, is the hardest
substance in the body.
Importance of pH in Everyday Life
• However, when the pH in the mouth decreases (below 5.5), it corrodes the
teeth.
• The salt, normally, is formed by the combination of hydrochloric acid and
sodium hydroxide solution; and, the combination is known as sodium
chloride.
• When the pH value of rain water is measured as less than 5.6, it is known
as acid rain.
• When acid rain flows into the rivers, then it also lowers the pH of the river
water
• The acidic river water is threat for the survival of aquatic life.
pH of some important substances
• Gastric juice : 1- 3
• Urine (Human)- 5.5 to 7.5
• Saliva (Human)- 6.5 to 7.5
• Tears : 7.4
• Milk (cow) : 6.3 to 6.6
• Sea water : 8.5
• Soft drinks : 2.0 to 4.0
Bleaching Powder and Baking Soda
• Bleaching Powder
 Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on dry slaked
lime [Ca(OH)2
] and it is represented as CaOCl2
.
 Bleaching powder is normally used in textile industry, paper factory,
chemical industry, and disinfecting the drinking water.
• Baking Soda
 The baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen in order to cook tasty
crispy food items. It also cooks some food items faster.
 The chemical name of baking soda is sodium hydrogencarbonate and
formula is NaHCO3
.
Washing Soda and Plaster of Paris
• Washing Soda
 Recrystallization of sodium carbonate results into washing soda.
 The chemical formula of washing soda is Na2CO3
.10H2O.
 Washing soda is commonly used in glass, soap, and paper industries.
• Plaster of Paris
 Plaster of Paris is a white powder that doctors use as plaster for
supporting fractured bones.
 The chemical name of Plaster of Paris is calcium sulphate hemihydrate
and chemical formula is 2CaSO4
.H2O.
HARDNESS OF WATER
• Water which does not easily form lather with soap is known as hard water.
• The hardness of water is due to presence of soluble salts of calcium and magnesium.
• TEMPORARY HARDNESS
 It is caused due to bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium can be removed by boiling
or adding slaked lime(Ca(OH)2). / Clark’s Process.
 Ex:- CaHCO3 ,MgHCO3
• PERMANENT HARDNESS
 Permanent hardness caused by chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium can
be removed by adding caustic soda (NaOH) or washing soda (Na2CO3) or Calgon
(sodium hexametaphosphate, [Na2 (Na4(PO3)6] or zeolite/ permutit (hydrated sodium
aluminium silicate / Na2Al2SiO8.xH2O
 Ex:- CaSO4, MgCl2.
• From sea water, pure water is obtained by a process, called
reverse osmosis i.e. by applying pressure higher than the
osmotic pressure towards the solution side.
• This process is called desalination of sea water.
• Degree of hardness : It is defined as the number of parts of
CaCO3 or equivalent to various calcium or magnesium salts
present in 10^6 parts of water by mass.
SOAPS
• Soap is a sodium salt or potassium salt of long chain fatty acids
that has cleansing action in water.
• Action of Most of the dirt is oily in nature and oil does not
dissolve in water.
• The molecule of soap constitutes sodium or potassium salts of
long chain carboxylic acids.
• In the case of soaps, the carbon chain dissolves in oil and the
ionic end dissolves in water.
• Thus the soap molecules form structures called micelles.
• In micelles, one end is towards the oil droplet and the other
end which is the ionic faces outside.
• Therefore, it forms an emulsion in water and helps in
dissolving the dirt when we wash our clothes.
SOAPS
• Soap is a kind of molecule in which both the
ends have different properties.
 Hydrophilic end
 Hydrophobic end
• The first one is the hydrophilic end which
dissolves water and is attracted towards it
whereas the second one is the hydrophobic
end that is dissolved in hydrocarbons and is
water repulsive in nature.
• If on the surface of the water, soap is present
then the hydrophobic tail which is not soluble
in water will align along the water surface.
MICELLES
• In water, the soap molecule is uniquely oriented which
helps to keep the hydrocarbon part outside the water.
When the clusters of molecules are formed then
hydrophobic tail comes at the interior of the cluster and
the ionic end comes at the surface of the cluster and
this formation is called micelle.
• When the soap is in the form of micelles then it has the
ability to clean the oily dirt which gets accumulated at
the center. These micelles remain as a colloidal
solutions. Therefore, the dirt from the cloth is easily
washed away. The soap solution appears cloudy as it
forms a colloidal solution which scatters light.
Soaps vs. Detergents
Soaps Detergents
They are metal salts of long chain fatty
acids
These are sodium salts of long chains
hydrocarbons like alkyl sulphates or alkyl
benzene sulphates
These are prepared from vegetable oils
and animal fats
They are prepared from hydrocarbons of
petroleum or coal
They cannot be used effectively in hard
water as they produce scum i.e insoluble
Precipitates of Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+ etc
These do not produce insoluble
precipitates in hard water. They are
effective in soft, hard or salt water.
DISADVANTAGES OF DETERGENTS
• Many detergents are resistant to the action of biological agents and
thus are not biodegradable. Their elimination from municipal waste
waters by the usual treatments is a problem.
• They have a tendency to produce stable foams in rivers that extend
over several hundred meters of the river water.
• This is due to the effects of surfactants used in their preparation.
Thus, they pose a danger to aquatic life.
RADIOACTIVITY
• The process of emission of particles from nuclei because of the
nuclear instability; is known as radioactivity.
• The substance that releases such energy/rays is known as
radioactive substance.
• The invisible rays released from such radioactive substance are
known as radioactive rays.
• Likewise, radioactivity is a nuclear phenomenon that happens
(naturally) because of the nuclear instability of atoms.
RADIOACTIVITY
• In 1896 Henry Becquerel first observed the phenomena of
radioactivity, but the term ‘radioactivity’ was coined by Marie Curie.
• Marie Curie discovered the radioactive elements namely Polonium
and Radium in 1898.
• For her discovery, Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize.
Radioactive Rays
• After long years of experiment, Ernest Rutherford along with his
colleague (Hans Geiger and his student Ernest Marsden), discovered
alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays.
RADIOACTIVITY
These rays emitted as the result of the disintegration of atoms.
Alpha (α) Particles
• Alpha particles are usually composed of two
protons and two neutrons, which are tightly
bound together.
• Alpha particles are being released during
radioactive decay (or alpha decay) from the
nucleus radio nuclides.
• The alpha particles are identical to the nucleus
of either normal helium atom or doubly ionized
helium atom.
• In comparison to other particles (i.e. Gamma and
Beta), alpha particles are heavy and slow.
Therefore, alpha particles have very small range in
the air.
Alpha (α) Particles
• Because of slow speed, Alpha particles have very weak penetrating
powers; these particles are even stopped by a thin paper sheet.
• Because of having the double positive charge, alpha particles are
highly ionizing.
Beta (β) Particles
• Beta particles are the fast moving electrons emitted by
some radio nuclides during the radioactive decay (also
known as beta decay).
• Beta particles are of much lighter weight and carry a
single negative charge.
• Beta particles are rarely ionizing than the alpha particles.
• Because of having lighter weight, beta particles can travel
much farther than alpha particles; however, beta particles
can be stopped by several sheet of papers or one sheet of
aluminum.
• Beta particles are negatively charged and get attracted
towards positively charged particles.
Gamma (ү) Particles
• Gamma particles are the bundle of high energy namely
electromagnetic energy (photon) emitted by the
radioactive elements during the radioactive decay.
• Among all three particles (alpha, beta, and gamma),
gamma particles are the most energetic photons.
• Gamma particles, which are the form of electromagnetic
radiation(EMR), originate from the nucleus.
• The wavelengths of gamma are the shortest among all
three.
• Gamma particles have no charge and they are neutral;
therefore, they are unaffected by magnetic and electric
fields.
Uses of Radioactive Elements
• Radioactive elements are used in −
 Medical field (treatment of many diseases)
 Industrial process
 Energy production – Nuclear reactors
 Radio carbon dating is used to determine the age of carbon
bearing materials like wood, animal fossil etc.
 Uranium dating is used to determne the age of earth, minerals
and rocks.
Half life
• It is the time in which a radioactive substance remains half of
its original amount.
• It is related to total time T as
• T = n X t1/2 and N= No (1/2)n
• Where N = amount left And No = initial amount
• The half life of a radioactive substances varies inversely with
its activity.
Radioisotopes and their uses
• Iodine-131 is used to study the structure and activity of
Thyroid gland. It is also used in internal radiation therapy for
the treatment of thyroid disease.
• Iodine-123 is used in brain imaging.
• Cobalt-60 is used in external treatment of cancer.
• Sodium- 24 is injected along with salt solution to trace the
flow of blood.
• Phosphorous- 32 is used for leukemia therapy.
• Carbon-14 is used o study the kinetics of photosynthesis.
NUCLEAR REACTIONS
• Nuclear reactions release tremendous amount of energy (known as
nuclear energy), which are being used to produce electricity in a nuclear
power plant. The nuclear energy normally produced by nuclear fission,
nuclear fusion, and nuclear decay.
• In 1938, German chemists Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, and the Austrian
physicist Lise Meitner conducted the experiments in which the products of
neutron-bombarded uranium.
• As result of this experiment, the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of
the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces and released
massive energy.
• The nuclear experiments of Otto Hahn and his colleagues are popular as
nuclear fission.
NUCLEAR REACTIONS
• A bombardment-driven process that results from
the collision of two subatomic particles.
• In nuclear reactions, a subatomic particle collides
with an atomic nucleus and causes changes to it.
• Nuclear reactions are thus driven by the
mechanics of bombardment, not by the relatively
constant exponential decay and half-life
characteristic of spontaneous radioactive
processes.
• The first ever nuclear reaction in which one
element was changed into another element was
carried out in 1919.
NUCLEAR FISSION
• Nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the
nucleus of an atom splits into smaller, lighter nuclei.
• The fission process often produces free neutrons , and releases a very large
amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.
• Ex:- 235U(Isotope of uranium) undergoes fission or breaking down when neutron is
bombarded , it changes to unstable nucleus of isotope 236U, this will further break
down into krypton and barium with the release of large amount of energy and 3
molecules of neutron.
• These neutrons will further lead to chain reaction of breaking down and release of
high amount of energy.
• In nuclear power plant, the reactions are controlled process.
NUCLEAR FISSION
Types of Nuclear Fission
Following are the major types of Nuclear Fission −
• Chain Reaction and
• Fission Reaction
Chain Reaction
• When one single nuclear reaction
causes one or more subsequent
nuclear reactions, it is known as
chain reaction.
• Such chain reaction increases the
possibility of a self-propagating
series of nuclear reactions.
• The nuclear chain reactions release
million times more energy per
reaction than any other chemical
reaction; therefore, it is also known
as explosive or uncontrolled chain
reaction.
Chain Reaction
• When a heavy atom experiences nuclear fission, it normally breaks into
two or more fission fragments. During the process, several free neutrons,
gamma rays, and neutrinos are emitted, and ultimately a large amount of
energy is released.
• Following are the two examples of chain reaction −

235U + → neutron Fission fragments + 2.4 neutrons + 192.9 MeV

235Pu + → neutron Fission fragments + 2.9 neutrons + 198.9 MeV
• In atom bomb, chain reaction technology is used, as it required consistent
source of energy.
• In atom bomb U235 or PU 239 are used as a fuel.
Fission Reactions
• The fission reaction in which neutrons (produced by fission of fuel
atoms) are used to induce yet more fission for the release of
sustainable energy, is known as fission reactions.
• Such reactions are slow and controllable; therefore, also known as
controlled chain reaction.
• The power (electricity) producing nuclear reactor is an ideal
example of controlled chain reaction.
Fission Reactions
• Based on the properties and type of usages, fission/controlled chain
reaction is classified as −
 Power reactors
 Research reactors
 Breeder reactors
• These power reactors generally convert the kinetic energy of fission
products into heat; further, the heat is used to heat a working fluid
that drives a heat engine, which ultimately generates mechanical or
electrical power.
Nuclear Fusion
• The process in which
smaller atoms put
together to form large
molecule with the
release of high amount
of energy, even more
than fission reactions,
occur in the presence of
sunlight.
Nuclear Fusion
• In this process, two light nuclei are fused to form a heavy nucleus is
known as nuclear fusion; during this process, a tremendous amount
of energy is being released known as nuclear energy.
• The best example of nuclear fusion is – hydrogen bomb.
• A hydrogen bomb is about 1,000 times more powerful than an
atom bomb. ( H bomb contains a mixture of D2O and T2O)
• Sun’s energy is due to Nuclear fusion.
Difference Between Fission and Fusion
NUCLEAR REACTOR
NUCLEAR REACTOR
• For controlled process we use nuclear reactors, we use Control
rods as cadmium, boron silver, indium or zirconium to absorb
excess neutrons.
• Heavy water D2O(Deuterium oxide), graphite are used as a
neutron moderator to slow down neutrons,
• Coolant in a nuclear reactor is used to remove heat generated from
it. It flushes out heat to electrical generators and environment. It
may contain sodium or heavy water or an alloy of Na and K as
coolant.
METALLOIDS
• They possess the characteristics of both metals as well as non metal.
• They are called metalloids and semi- metals have mostly non-metallic properties.
• One of their distinguishing characteristics is that their conductivity increases as
their temperature increases.
• While normal metal conductivity decreases with the increase in temperature. This
property is known as semi conductance and the materials are called semiconductors.
• They are important in digital electronics, such as computers.
• The metalloids include elements such as Boron , Silicon, Germanium, Arsenic,
Antimony and Tellurium.

Economy and Factors
of Production
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Economy
• An economy is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and
consumption of goods and services by different agents.
• 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices,
discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and
management of resources'.
• Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments.
• Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or
price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a
certain currency.
• However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic
domain.
Economic Activity
• Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources,
labor, and capital.
• It has changed over time due to technology (automation, accelerator of
process, reduction of cost functions), innovation (new products, services,
processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets,
increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual
property and changes in industrial relations (for example, child labor being
replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).
Types of Economy
Capitalistic
Economy
State
Economy
Mixed
Economy
Capitalistic Economy
• The capitalistic form of economy has its origin in the famous work of
Adam Smith—Wealth of Nations (1776).
• He raised his voice against the heavy-handed government regulation of
commerce and industry of the time which did not allow the economy
to tap its full economic worth and reach the level of well-being.
• Stressing ‘division of labor’ and an environment of ‘laissez faire’ (noninterference by the government), he proposed that the ‘invisible hand’
of ‘market forces’ (price mechanism) will bring a state of equilibrium in
the economy and a general well-being for the countrymen.
Capitalistic Economy
• For such an economy to function for public well-being, he
acknowledged the need of competition in the market.
• The decisions of what to produce, how much to produce and at
what price to sell are taken by the market, by the private
enterprises in this system, with the state having no economic role.
State Economy
• Rooted in the ideas of historical change proposed by the German
philosopher Karl Marx (1818– 1883), more specifically, this kind of
economic system first came up in the erstwhile USSR after the Bolshevik
Revolution (1917) and got its ideal shape in the People’s Republic of China
(1949).
• This form of economic system also spread to other countries in Eastern
Europe. Here we see two versions of the state economy—in erstwhile
USSR known as the socialist economy and in pre-1985 China as the
communist economy.
State Economy
• While a socialistic economy emphasised collective ownership of the means of
production (property and assets), it also ascribed a large role to the state in
running the economy, while communist economy, on the other hand,
advocated state ownership of all properties including labour with absolute
power to state in running the economy.
• Though for Marx, Socialism was a transitional stage to communism, it never did
happen in reality.
• Basically, this form of economy came in reaction to the prevalent popular
economic system of capitalism and proposed just the opposite.
State Economy
• The decisions related to production, supply and prices were all suggested
to be taken solely by the state only.
• Such economies were also known as Centralised Economy, Centrally
Planned Economy or Non-market Economy.
• The socialist and communist economies used to criticise capitalistic
economics of being based on exploitation.
• In response, the capitalist economies called them the practioners of ‘state
capitalism’, where the state was the sole exploitator
Mixed Economy
• In this both Govt and Private play the role.
• It means it’s a joint sector where both private and public
sector combine and run the country.
• Since independence India has been a 'Mixed Economy'.
• India's large public sectors were responsible for rendering the
country a 'mixed economy' feature.
Factors of Production
• Anything that helps in production is the factor of production.
• These are the various factors by mean any resource is transformed
into a more useful commodity or service.
• They are the inputs for the process of production.
• They are the starting point of the production process.
• Factors of production are the parameters which affect the output of
production.

Slave Dynasty
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• Mohammad appointed Qutub-ud-din as Naib-us-Sultanate (Viceroy) of his
empire in India and bestowed him the title of Aibak (The axis of faith).
• Mohammad Ghori was assassinated in 1206 by Khokhars in Punjab. He
had no sons, so after his death, his Turkic slaves distributed the empire
among themselves.
• In India, Qutub-ud-din became the first of the 34 Muslim Kings who ruled
between 1206 to 1526.
Introduction
• These 34 Kings belonged to five dynasties and are collectively called “Delhi Sultanate”.
1. Mamluk {Slave} Dynasty (1206-1290): Turkish Origin
2. Khilji dynasty (1290–1320) : Turkish Origin
3. Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1413): Turkish Origin
4. Sayyid dynasty (1414–51) : Disputed / Arabian Origin
5. Lodi dynasty (1451–1526) : Afghan Origin
• The continuance of the three Turkish origin dynasties was disturbed by the invasion of
Timur in 1398, which put an end to the Tughlaqs and the Delhi Sultanate was broken up in
pieces.
• It was taken over by the Sayyid Dynasty which were actually nobles and claimed Arabian
descent from the dynasty of Hazarat Muhammad.
• Lodi dynasty was last before Mughals took over Delhi.

Mamluk Origins
• Mamluk Dynasty is also called Slave Dynasty.
• Mamluk literally means ‘owned’ and it refers
to a powerful military caste called Mamluks
which originated in the 9th century CE in the
Islamic Empire of the Abbasid caliphs.
• The Mamluks yielded military and political
power in Egypt, Iraq and India. Although they
were slaves, they were held in high regard by
their masters, and they were mostly generals
and soldiers who fought for their masters.
• Mamluk Dynasty was established in Delhi by
Qutb ud-Din Aibak.
Mamluk / Ilbari or Slave Dynasty
• Established by Qutb ud-Din Aibak.
• He was born to a Turkish family in Central Asia
and was sold as a slave in his childhood.
• As a viceroy of Sultan Muhammad Ghori, he
sacked Banaras in 1194 AD.
• He also defeated the raja of Ajmer.
• He forced Raja Solankhoal to pay tribute after
conquering Gwalior.
• Besides, he won the kingdom of Gujarat.
Mamluk or Ilbari or Slave Dynasty
• Dynasty lasted from 1206 to 1290.
• Iltutmish succeeded Qutb-ud-din Aibak (1211-36) which is further
followed by Razia (1236-40) and Balban (1265-85).
• It was the first of the dynasties to rule as the Delhi Sultanate.
• The dynasty is called Ilbari dynasty because all rulers of this dynasty,
except Aibak, belonged to Ilbari tribe of Turks.
• Dynasty ended when Jalal ud din Firuz Khilji overthrew the last Mamluk
ruler Muiz ud din Qaiqabad in 1290.
• Dynasty was succeeded by the Khilji (or Khalji) dynasty, the second
dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate.

• He began the construction of Qutb Minar in
Delhi which was named after a Sufi saint Khwaja
Qutb-ud-din Bakhtiyar Kaki.
• He was also known as Lakh Bash (Giver of Lakhs)
for his generosity. However, he was also
responsible for the destruction of many Hindu
temples.
• He reigned till his death in 1210. Qutb-ud-din

• He was succeeded by Aram Shah. He
was later killed by lltutmish.
Iltutmish (Reign: 1211 – 1236)
• Aram Shah was a weak ruler. It is not clear whether
he was a son of Aibak or not.
• He was conspired against by a group of nobles who
invited Shamsuddin Iltutmish to be the ruler.
• At the time of Aibak’s death, he was the governor of
Badaun.(UP)
• He is considered as the real founder of the Delhi
Sultanate, and made Delhi the seat of governance in
preference to Lahore.

as Slave of the Slave.
Iltutmish (Reign: 1211 – 1236)
• He was a turkic slave born in Central Asia.
• He was the greatest of the slave rulers of Delhi.
• He shifted his capital from Lahore to Delhi.
• During the reign of Iltutmish in 1221,, the Mongols
had attacked India under Chengez Khan because
Iltutmish was refusing to give refuge to an enemy
of Khan, Jalaluddin Mangabarani ( a ruler from
Iran).
• But they soon left India and moved towards
Multan, Sind and Qabacha.
Iltutmish (Reign: 1211 – 1236)
• He completed the construction of the Quwwat-ulIslam mosque and the Qutb Minar.
• He set up an administrative machinery for the
kingdom.

• He issued coins and had Khutba read in his name.
• The Silver Tanka was weighing 175 grams. Later
Balban issued Gold Tankas of same weight.
Iltutmish (Reign: 1211 – 1236)
• He is credited with building the Hauz-i- Shamshi
near Mehrauli in Delhi and also built India’s first
Islamic Mausoleum(group of tombs) Sultan Garhi
in Delhi to bury his son Nasiru’d-Din Mahmud.
• He is also called Father of Tomb building in India.
• Prior to these, the invaders had issued coins
engraved with Sanskrit characters.
• For example, Mohammad Ghori issued coins with
seated Lakshmi in imitation to the Gahadwals.
• Iltutmish became the first ruler to issue Arabic
coins in India.
Iltutmish (Reign: 1211 – 1236)
• He was also the first Sultan to receive the investiture of “Sovereign Sultan of Delhi” from
the Caliph of Baghdad. This investiture legitimized his rule.
• He gave a governing class or an official nobility to the Sultanate called Chahalgani or the
group of “forty”.
• Also introduced the Iqtadari system in which the kingdom was divided into Iqtas which
were assigned to nobles in exchange of salary.
• The iqtadars retained a part of the revenue from the iqta rendering military service to
the Sultan.
• Large iqtadars were put in-charge of maintaining law and order in their iqta, in addition
to sending troops to the Sultan in times of need.
Iltutmish (Reign: 1211 – 1236)
• He engaged himself in sensual pleasures while his mother Shah Turkan
created dissatisfaction among the nobility. He was assassinated within 7
months.
• At the capital, Razia took advantage of Firuz’s (her brother) absence. She
succeeded in getting the support of the people of Delhi and declared
herself the Sultana of Delhi in the absence of Firuz.
Razia Sultana (Reign: 1236 – 1240)
• Born in 1205 as Iltutmish’s daughter.
• Was given a sound education by her father.
• She was the first and last Muslim woman to rule
over Delhi.
• Also known as Razia al-Din.
• Before ascending to the throne of Delhi after her
father’s death, the reign was briefly handed over to
her half-brother Rukn ud-din Firuz.
• But after Firuz’s assasination within 6 months of his
ascendency, the nobles agreed to placing Razia on
the throne.
Razia Sultana (Reign: 1236 – 1240)
• She was known as an efficient and just ruler.
• Although, she had all the qualities of a good monarch, the Chihalgani (the group of
forty Turkish chiefs) couldn’t accept the rule of a woman.
• They rebelled against Razia when she appointed her favourite Yakut as the
superintendent of the Stables (Dept. of Horses).
• Yakut was an Abyssinian which raised the jealousy of Turko-Afghan nobles.
• Soon a battle ensued between the two rival groups following which Yakut was killed
and Razia was taken prisoner.
Razia Sultana (Reign: 1236 – 1240)
• She was married to Malik Ikhtiar-ud-din Altunia, the governor of Bathinda.
• Now they jointly tried to take the sultanate back which was captured by
Razia’s brother Muizuddin Bahram Shah.
• However, Razia and her husband were defeated and they were forced to flee.
• While fleeing to Kaithal, they were captured by the Jats and assassinated.
• Later, Muizuddin Bahram Shah was killed by his own army. The period ensued saw
some puppet kings sitting on the throne of Delhi sultanate.
• Nasir-ud-din Mahmud, the youngest son of Iltutmish ruled from 1246 to 1266,
primarily assisted by a Turk chief Balban.
• Balban later on succeeded Nasir-ud-din Mahmud.
Ghiyas ud din Balban
(Reign: 1266 – 1287)
• The next notable ruler after Razia.
• Ninth Sultan in the Mamluk dynasty.

Ghiyas ud din Balban
(Reign: 1266 – 1287)
• He was deeply racist and excluded non turks from the administration.
• He strengthened the frontiers against Mongols.
• But his son, Muhammad’s death was a smashing blow to Balban and the death
knell to his dynasty.
• After his death, his grandson Qaiqabad succeeded him at the throne of Delhi.
• Qaiqabad died of a stroke in 1290 and was succeeded by his three-year-old son
Shamsuddin Kayumars.
• Kayumars was murdered by Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji, thus ending the Mamluk
Dynasty to replace it with the Khalji Dynasty.

Concepts of
National Income
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Measures of National Income
• Introduction: National income is the total value a country’s final output of
all new goods and services produced in one year.
• To avoid the problem of double counting, only the value of the final stage, the
retail price, is included, and not the value added in all the intermediate stages
- the costs of production, plus profits.
• Following are the measures of National Income:
 GDP
 NDP
 GNP
 NNP
 GNI
 NNI
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
• GDP is the final value of the goods and services produced within the
geographic boundaries of a country during a year.
• GDP growth rate is an important indicator of the economic performance
of a country.
• In India, contributions to GDP are mainly divided into 3 broad sectors –
agriculture and allied, industry and service sector.
2. Net Domestic Product (NDP)
• Net domestic product accounts for capital that has been consumed over the
year in the form of housing, vehicle, or machinery deterioration.
• NDP = GDP – Depreciation
• Capital Goods: Capital Goods are tangible assets such as buildings, machinery,
equipment, vehicle, and tools that an organization uses to produce goods or
services in order to produce consumer goods and goods for other businesses.
• Net domestic product is GDP adjusted for depreciation.
• „Depreciation is the amount of capital used up in producing that year's GDP.
• The depreciation of assets figure is determined by assessing the loss of value of
assets attributed to normal use and ageing.
Capital Consumption Allowance (CCA)
• „The capital consumption allowance provides a mechanism to measure the need to
replace certain assets and resources to maintain a specified level of national
productivity.
• „It is generally divided into two categories: physical capital and human capital.
• Physical capital can include real estate, machinery or any other tangible resource
used in the production of goods and services aside from the human element.
• Human capital covers the skills, knowledge and abilities of a workforce to produce
goods and services, as well as the necessary training or education that may be
required to maintain production standards.
3. Gross National Product (GNP)
• GNP is an estimate of total value of all the final products and services produced
in a given period by the means of production owned by a country's residents.
• „GNP is commonly calculated by taking the sum of personal consumption
expenditures, private domestic investment, government expenditure, net
exports, and any income earned by residents from overseas investments, minus
income earned within the domestic economy by foreign residents.
• „Hence, GNP is the value of final goods and services produced by the residents.
• Net exports here represent the difference between what a country exports
minus any imports of goods and services.
3. Gross National Product (GNP)
• „GNP (calculated from GDP) = GDP + (income earned on all foreign assets) –
(income earned by foreigners in the country).
• The net foreign factor income (NFFI) is the difference between a nation’s gross
national product (GNP) and gross domestic product (GDP). Net foreign factor
income (NFFI) is the difference between the aggregate amount that a country’s
citizens and companies earn abroad, and the aggregate amount that foreign
citizens and overseas companies earn in that country.
• NFFI = GNP – GDP
4. Gross National Income (GNI)
• Gross national income is a measurement of a country's income. It includes
all the income earned by a country's residents and businesses, including
those earned abroad.
• GNI measures all income of a country's residents and businesses,
regardless of where it is produced.
• GNI measures income earned, including that from investments that flows
back into the country.
Calculation of GNI and NNI
• GNI (calculated from GDP) = GDP + (income from citizens and businesses
earned abroad) – (income remitted by foreigners living in the country back to
their home countries).
• GNI (calculated from GNP) = GNP + (income spent by foreigners within the
country) – (foreign income not remitted by citizens).
• Net National Income (NNI) = GNI – Depreciation = NDP + (income from citizens
and businesses earned abroad) – (income remitted by foreigners living in the
country back to their home countries).
Why is a there difference in GNP, GNI and GDP?
• In many emerging markets, such as India, residents move to other
countries where they can earn a better living. They send lots of money
back to their families in their home country called remittances.
• This income is large enough (remittances around 60 billion dollar) to drive
economic growth in India.
• It is counted in GNI and GNP, though not in GDP.
• Hence, comparisons of GDP by country will understate the size of these
countries' economies.
Net National Product (NNP)
• The net national product (NNP) is the monetary value of finished goods
and services produced by a country's citizens, whether overseas or
resident, in a year (i.e., the gross national product, or GNP) minus
depreciation.
• The NNP can be calculated from the GNP by subtracting the depreciation
of any assets, also known as the capital consumption allowance (CCA),
from its total.
GNI per Capita
• GNI per capita is a measurement of income divided by the number of
people in the country.
• It compares the GNI of countries with different population sizes and
standards of living.
• The World Bank provides GNI data for all countries.
• In order to compare incomes between countries, it removes the effects of
currency exchange rates.
• This is done by converting everything to the U.S. dollar using purchasing
power parity (PPP).
National Income (NI) at Current
Price and Constant Price
NI at current price
• It is the value of final goods and services produced by residents of a
country in a year, measured at the prices of the prevailing current year.
• For example: When goods and services produced during the year 2017-18
are valued at prices of the same year, i.e. 2017-18, it will be called national
income at current prices for the year 2017-18.
• Hence, it is called ‘Nominal National Income’ as it doesn’t give the real
picture of growth as any increase in nominal national income may be due
to rise in price level without any change in physical output.
• In order to eliminate effect of inflation or price rise, the real GDP at
constant price is calculated.
Real GDP and the Price Level
• Real GDP is the value of final goods and services produced in a
given year when valued at constant prices.
• Calculating Real GDP
 „The first step in calculating real GDP is to calculate nominal GDP.
• Nominal GDP is the value of goods and services produced during a
given year valued at the prices that prevailed in that same year.
NI at Constant Price
• It is the value of final goods and services produced by residents of a
country in a year measured at base year price.
• „Base year is a year which is normally free from high fluctuations of price.
Presently, base year for Indian economy is 2011-12.
• Hence, if we measure India’s National Income of present year at the prices
of 2011-12, then it is termed as ‘National Income at constant price’.
• „It is called real national income. It shows the true picture of economic
growth of a country as any increase in real national income is due to
increase in output only.
GDP deflator
 GDP deflator reflects the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in the
economy.
 The GDP deflator also includes the prices of investment goods, government services and
exports.
 Monthly change in inflation cannot be tracked using GDP deflator.
• The GDP deflator, also called implicit price deflator, is a measure of inflation. It is the ratio of
the value of goods and services an economy produces in a particular year at current prices
to that of prices that prevailed during the base year.
• This ratio helps show the extent to which the increase in gross domestic product has
happened on account of higher prices rather than increase in output.
• It is calculated by dividing Nominal GDP by Real GDP and then multiplying by 100.
• GDP at Factor cost is measured as a payment made to the factors of
production. Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship are factors of
production to which Rent, Wage, Interest, Profit has to be paid.
• GDP at market price is the sum total of gross value added (GVA ) in
production of all goods and services within the country.
• Thus, the difference between the two is the net indirect taxes (Indirect
taxes paid -Subsidies received).
• GDP at factor cost = GDP at Market price + Subsidies – Indirect taxes.
Methods of Measuring National Income
• The flow diagram below shows the circular
flow of income between individuals or
households and business firms.
• The arrows on the upper part shows demand
side of economy and arrows on the lower
part shows supply side of economy.
• So, it can be said that one’s income is
expenditure to other and vice-versa. Thus
income of one player and expenditure of
other player are equal. As a result National
Income can be computed by compiling the
income of all or expenditure of all.
Methods of Measuring National Income
Hence, calculation of National Income can be done by three
methods which are:
Income Method Expenditure Method Product Method
Income Method
• In this method the National Income is calculated by compiling income
of factors of production i.e. labour, land, capital, and entrepreneur.
• National Income = Total wage + Total rent + Total interest + Total profit
• GDP = Compensation of employees + Consumption of fixed capital +
(Other taxes on production – Subsidies on production) + Gross
operating surplus
Income Method
• „GDP = Compensation of employees + Consumption of fixed capital + (Other
taxes on production – Subsidies on production) + Gross operating surplus
• Compensation of employees is wages paid as salaries in cash and kind, and
other benefits.
• „Consumption of fixed capital means replacement of wear and tear parts with
new parts of machinery. As it adds to income of machinery so the value is added
here.
• „Other taxes on production minus subsidies are the net tax on production.
• „Gross operating surplus is the balance of value added after deducting the above
three components. It goes to pay interest on capital and rent of land.
Expenditure or Consumption Method
• In this method consumption expenditure of consumers (C),
consumption expenditure of investors or entrepreneurs (I),
consumption of government (G), and net exports (X) is added.
• GDP = C + I + G + X
• Or
• GDP = Household final consumption expenditure + Consumption
expenditures incurred by general government and NPHIs + Savings
+ Gross capital formation
Expenditure or Consumption Method
• „GDP = Household final consumption expenditure + Consumption expenditures
incurred by general government and NPHIs + Savings + Gross capital formation
• Household final consumption expenditure is expenditure made by households
for goods or services.
• „Consumption expenditure incurred by government is expenditure on welfare
schemes and others and NPHIs i.e. Non-profit Institutions incurring investment
on households.
• „Savings is the amount that is not spent on expenditure rather it is the saved
amount.
• „Investment made on the fixed asset is known as Gross capital formation.
Product Method or Output Method
• In this method National Income is computed by calculating the gross value
of final goods and services produced in a country in one year. The concept
of GDP is based on Gross Value Added.
• Gross Value Added (GVA) = Output of final goods and services –
Intermediate Consumption
• GDP = GVA + Indirect Taxes – Subsidies
Inclusions of National Income
• Items not included in National Income – Intermediate goods, Transfer
payments (unilateral payments made without expectations of return; like
gifts, unemployment allowance, donations etc), sale and purchase of old
goods and existing services (shares are not included, unless they are
through an IPO), windfall gains (lottery income), black money (cannot be
estimated), work done by housewives
• Items included in National Income (NI) – Goods produced for selfconsumption, estimated rent of self-occupied property
Quick Facts
• First rough estimate of NI was done by Dadabhai Naoroji for 1867-68;
published in his book Poverty and Unbritish rule in India (famous for its
Drain of Wealth theory)
• First scientific estimate made by Prof V K R V Rao (1931-32)
• GoI estimated the NI for the first time in 1948-49 through the Ministry of
Commerce
• National Income Committee was set up in 1949 (Chairman – Dr P C
Mahalanobis)
Quick Facts
• P C Mahalanobis was also the chairman of Indian Statistical Institute
• Currently, Central Statistical Organization (est 1950) estimates NI (since
1956)
• It publishes National Accounts Statistics annually
• Under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation
• Now, CSO has been merged with National Sample Survey Organization to
form National Statistical Organization
Per Capita Income
 Per Capita Income = National Income/Population
 Per Capita Income is the best indicator of Economic Development.
• If the production of goods and services increases, we call it Economic
Growth
• That process of Economic Growth which leads to improvement in the
general welfare of people is called Economic Development. It means
progressive changes in the socio-economic structure of the country

Khilji Dynasty
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• The coming of Khalji dynasty is seen as a revolution as their entry decreased the
effect of turk officials in the administration
• Khilji’s were the Indian muslims
• The Khilji Dynasty was the second dynasty of Delhi Sultanate who came from Central
Asia.
• In course of time they adopted the Khurasanian's (northeast of Greater Iran,
including part of Central Asia and Afghanistan) urbane culture and certain Afghan
custom and social traditions from Ghaznavids.
• Therefore, the court of Khiljis was of multi-ethnical background with people of
Persian, Indian, Arab and Turkish origin.
• This marked an end to the monopolization of power and racial dictatorship by Ilbari
Turks and also led to the widening of the social base of the ruling class.
Khilji Dynasty
Introduction
• The Khiljis served under the Ilbari dynasty of Delhi.
• Malik Firuz was the founder of the Khilji Dynasty who was originally the Ariz-IMumalik appointed by Qaiqabad during the days of the decline of the Ilbari
Dynasty.
• He took advantage of the political vacuum that was created due to the
incompetence of the successors of Balban.
• On June 13, 1290, Malik Firuz ascended the throne of Delhi as Jalal-ud-din
Firuz Khilji.
Jalal-ud-din Firoz Khilji
(1290-1296 A.D.)
• He was the founder of Khilji Dynasty.
• He was also called as “Clemency Jalal-uddin” as he
followed peace and wanted to rule without violence.
• His real name was Malik Feroz Khilji
• He ruled from 1290 – 1296
• He is remembered as a benevolent ruler. Thus also known
as a ‘Saint ruler’.
• The most important retaliation during his reign was of Sidi
Maula, which was suppressed by him.
• He was the first ruler to put forward the view that since a
large majority of people in India are Hindus, the state in
India could not be a total islam state.
Jalal-ud-din Firoz Khilji
(1290-1296 A.D.)
• He attempted to lay siege to the Ranthambore fort (Hamir Dev )which was
unsuccessful.
• The fort was well fortified and was believed to be the most powerful fort
of the time.
• Married his daughter to Ulugh Khan, a descendant of Chenqiz khan, to win
their goodwill.
Jalal-ud-din Firoz Khilji
(1290-1296 A.D.)
• Domestic Policies of Jalal-ud-din Firoz Khilji
 He suppressed Malik Chhajju’s revolt at Kara
 He appointed Ala-ud-din Khilji (Ali Gurshap) as the Governor of Kara.
Alauddin was his son-in-law and also nephew.
• Mongol Invasion
 In 1292 A.D. Jalal-ud-din defeated the Mongols who had come up to
Sunam.
• End of Jalal-ud-din
 Jalal-ud-din was treacherously murdered by Ala-ud-din Khilji his son-in-law.
 Jalal-ud-din’s policy of peace was not liked by many.
 After his successful campaign, Ali Gurshasp invited the Sultan to Kara to
receive the enormous wealth.
 Jalaluddin came to Kara in July 1296, where he was murdered by Ali Gurshasp,
who proclaimed himself the Sultan with the title of Alauddin.
Jalal-ud-din Firoz Khilji

• He seeked permission to attack Gujarat and
South India from Jalaluddin.
• He attacked Milsa (Gujarat) in 1293 and
Devgiri (Maharashtra) the capital of the
Yadava king, Raja Ramachandradeva, in the
Deccan, in 1294.
• Alauddin got excessive wealth during this
attack
Ala-ud-din Khilji
(1296-1316 A.D.)
• This wealth should ideally have been submitted in the central treasury of
the state, however he kept it with himself
• On asking by Jalaluddin, Jalaluddin was called by Alauddin to a place called
Kara to submit the wealth and killed there in 1296 A.D.
• Prior to he became the Sultan, his aunt (widow of Jalauddin) Malika Jahan
placed her son Rukunddin Khalji at the throne.
Ala-ud-din Khilji
(1296-1316 A.D.)
• Due to the benevolent nature of Jalaluddin and his non expansionist policies, the
provincial rulers under the dynasty had freed themselves. Thus it was now
important for Alauddin to win those areas back
• By this time, Mongols had a very strong army and a very aggressive expansionist
policy
• To face these attacks by the Mongols, Alauddin needed a big army
• Also to prove his legality, he distributed a lot of wealth between the people
• Slowly, he was able to bring the people of Delhi under his influence
• He then started to expand his kingdom

Dev II).
• There, First he married the Raja’s wife Kamla Devi and secondly there only he
acquired Malik Kafur, who later on rose to become a great military general.

• However he did not mention about the famous story of Rani Padmini, Queen of
Rana Ratan Singh.
• Alauddin named Chittor as Khizrabad after his son.
• Khizr Khan married to Deval Devi, the daughter of Rai Karan and Kamla Devi.
Ala-ud-din Khilji Invasions in the South
• He was the greatest ruler of the Khilji Dynasty and
was the first Muslim ruler to extend his empire
right up to the extreme South of India. .
• He sent his confidante and general Malik Kafur
against the rulers of the south.

• Pratap Rudra Dev gave Malik Kafur the world famous Kohinoor diamond,
which Kafur gifted to Alauddin.
• He constructed a mosque in Rameswaram/TN.
• The kingdoms of the south acknowledged the power of Alauddin Khilji and
paid his monetary tributes.
• He also strengthened the NWF under his trusted commander Ghazi malik.
The Mongol Invasion

(district) level.
• Amir Khusrau, for the first time, referred to them as zamindars.
• He separated religion from politics. He proclaimed -Kingship knows no Kinship.
Marketing System
• According to Barani, the economic regulations were primarily a military measure, i.e., to
maintain a large and efficient army for keeping the Mongols in check.
• But, Amir Khusrau considers it a welfare measure to ensure the supply of important
commodities at reasonable rates.
• He established three separate markets in Delhi for - food grains, costly cloths, horses, slaves
and cattle.
• Officers called Diwan-i-riyasat were appointed in the offices called Shahana-i-mandi to

Military Reforms
• The realisation of land revenue in cash enabled Alauddin to pay his soldiers in
cash. He was the first sultan to do so.
• Direct recruitment of the soldiers by Arz-i-Mamalik.
• Like Balban, he built several forts on North West frontier and repaired old ones.
• Introduction of Dagh (branding the horses) and Huliya or Chehra (descriptive rolls
of soldiers) system.
• Introduction of three grades of soldiers: Foot soldiers; Soldiers with one horse (ekaspa); Soldiers with two horses (do-asps)
Art and Learning

Successors after Ala-ud-din-Khilji
 Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah (1316-1320 A.D.)
 Nasir-ud-din Khusrau Shah (1320A.D.)
• His successors were weak.
End of the Dynasty
• Ala-ud-din Khilji died in 1316 A.D. and said to have been poisoned by Malik Kafur.
• He placed Shihab-ud-din Omar, an infant son of the late sultan, on the throne.
• Ambitious Malik Kafur made himself as sultan, but lacked support from
Muslim amirs and hence, he was killed only after few months.
• Mubarak Khilji, another son of Alauddin ruled for four years. He abolished all the
agrarian and market control regulations of his father. He was murdered by Khusrau
Malik.
• By 1,320, Khusrau Shah proved a great tyrant and was defeated and beheaded by
Ghazi Tughluq, the warden of the marches and the Governor of Punjab.
• Ghazi Tughluq became the new ruler of the Delhi sultanate under the title of
Ghias-ud-din Tughluq. Thus, Khilji dynasty was replaced by Tughluq dynasty.
Amir khusro
• He was disciple of Niamuddin Auliya of Delhi.
• Founder of Hindustani Classic Music and Qawwalis (devotional music of the Sufis)
• He was associated with royal courts of more than seven rulers of Delhi Sultanate

METALS and
NON-METALS
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Metals and Non-Metals
• There are 118 elements (ref. IUPAC/ International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry) known at present
• There are similarity as well as differences in the properties of these
elements on the basis of their properties, all the elements can be divided
into metals, non metals and metalloids.
• Metals and non metals are categorized on the basis of their
characteristics, such as
• MALLEABILITY: It is the ability of a metals to hammered into a sheet.
• DUCTILITY: It is when a solid material stretches under tensile strength.
• SONOROUS: The ability of a metal to produce sound on collision with the
metal.

MINERALS AND ORES
• The natural materials in which the metals or their compounds are
found are called minerals.
• Those minerals from which the metal can be extracted conveniently
and profitably are ores.
• Relative abundance of metal on earth : Al>Fe>Ca>K>Mg>Ti
• Ore of aluminium – Bauxite
• Gangue:- The impurities of ores is called gangue. It can be removed
by chemical called Flux. Flux and gangue mixes together to form
slag. The impurities are removed in the form of slag.
Metallurgy
• The various process involved in extraction of metals from their ores
and refining.
• Step 1: Concentration of ore :-
• The process of removing unwanted materials by different methods
 Hydraulic washing
o It is based on the density difference of ore and gangue. The
lighter one comes at the surface with water and separated
from the metals.
Metallurgy
 Magnetic separation
o If the ore has iron impurities, than that metal is grounded and
passed onto a conveyor belt with magnet attached at the ground
level. Thus, iron gets attracted by the magnet and separated out
from the metal.
 Froth floatation method
o It is for zinc sulfide and lead sulfide ore.
o It is based on the principal of wettability.
o Pine oil is added to dissolve sulphide in it and then it comes at the
surface in the form of bubbles and gets separated from it.
Metallurgy
 Leaching :
o For bauxite(aluminium ore)
o Also known as Bayer-process
o In this, ore is treated with suitable reagent (sodium
aluminium hydroxide) which dissolves ore leaving behind
impurities. This process is commonly referred to as
extraction, particularly in the chemical industry. Three basic
steps are involved in the leaching process: contact,
separation, and extraction.
Metallurgy
• Step 2: Conversion of concentrated ore into metal oxides:-
 Roasting : the process in which the ore is heated below its melting
point in presence of air to oxidize the impurities.
 ZnS + 2O2 - ZnSO4
 CuS + 2O2  CuSO4
 Calcination : the process of heating the ore below its melting point in
absence of air to remove volatile impurities.
 Al2O3.2H2O  Al2O3 + 2H2O
 Smelting : Reduction of oxide ore with Carbon at high temperature is
known as Smelting.
 Fe2O3 + 3C  2Fe + 3CO; PbO + C  Pb + CO
ROASTING vs. CALCINATIONS
Roasting Calcinations
Ore is heated in excess of air. Ore is heated in absence or limited supply
of heat
This is used for sulphide ores This is used for carbonate ores
So2 is produced along with metal oxides CO2 is produced along with metal oxide.
Ex: 2ZnS+3O2 gives 2ZnO+2SO2 Ex: ZnCO3 gives ZnO and CO2

RUSTING
• It is the corrosion of iron and readily occurs in the alloy steel. The
formation of a reddish brown flakes which loosely adheres to the
iron is called rust.
• In rusting, the weight of the iron is increased.
Galvanization and Quenching
• GALVANIZATION
 It is the process of coating iron with zinc layer to prevent it from
the contact of oxygen and water vapours.
• QUENCHING
 Quench hardening is a mechanical process in which steel and
cast iron alloys are strengthened and hardened.
 These metals consist of ferrous metals and alloys. This is done
by heating the material to a certain temperature, depending on
the material.
Quenching
• This produces a harder material by either surface hardening or
through-hardening varying on the rate at which the material is
cooled.
• The material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that
may increase from the quench hardening process.
• Items that may be quenched include gears, shafts, and wear blocks.
• Steel is heated to very high temperature, it becomes bright red and
then suddenly cooled in water or oil, it becomes extra ordinary hard
and brittle.
ANNEALING
• It is a heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes
chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce
its hardness, making it more workable.
• It involves heating a material above its recrystallization
temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature for a suitable
amount of time, and then cooling.
• Steel is heated to a temperature well below red hot and then
cooled slowly which turns it soft.
Annealing vs. Quenching
Annealing Quenching
Metal gets soft Metals get hard and brittle
Gradually cooling, heating less than its
boiling point
Direct cooling, heating at its boiling point
Liquidation and Distillation
• LIQUIDATION
 Those metals which have impurities with melting point higher than
metal.
 The material must be heated until one of the metals starts to melt and
drain away from the other and can be collected.
• DISTILLATION
 It is used for the separation of components of a mixture containing
two miscible liquids that boil without decomposition and have
sufficient difference in their boiling points. Ex:- Na, K, Zn and Hg.

• It can be applied on a surface to protect it from corrosion and weathering
or to give it an attractive look.
• A paint contains a pigment, a vehicle and a thinner. Zinc Oxide, white lead
and titanium oxide are commonly used white pigments.
• The pigments is mixed with oil like linseed or soya bean oil or a polymer.
• A thinner is a solvent such as turpentine oil or kerosene. It makes the paint
more fluid so that it may be applied easily.
• Luminous Paints : Glow when exposed to light , paints are applied on a
surface to protect it from corrosion and weathering or to give it an
attractive look.
ARTIFICIAL INORGANIC FERTILIZERS
(synthetic fertilizers)
Important nitrogenous fertilizers are
• AMMONIUM SULFATE
 Ammonium phosphate calcium cynamide
 Urea
• PHOSPHATIC FERTILIZERS
 Super phosphate of lime (calcium super phosphate)
 Triple super phosphate
 Ammonium super phosphate
ARTIFICIAL INORGANIC FERTILIZERS
(synthetic fertilizers)
• MIXED FERTILIZERS
 Contains NPK(nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium)
• INSECTICIDES(chemicals used to kill harmful insects)
 DDT(dichloro diphenyl trichloro ethane)
 BHC (benzene hexa chloride)
 Melathion
 HCN(hydrogen cyanide)
 NAPHTHALENE, NICOTENE
• HERBICIDES(chemicals used to kill unwanted plants called weeds)
 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4-D)
 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid
• FUNGICIDES(chemicals used to kill fungal growth)
 Lime
 Sulphur, formalin
• RODENTICIDES(chemicals used to kill rodents like rat)
 Sodium floroacetate,
 zinc phosphide
Dyes
• Coloured substances used for colouring textiles, food stuffs, silk, wool etc are called dyes.
Types of dyes are
• A) Nitro dyes : derivative of phenol where nito group acts as chromophore
• B) Azo dyes : presence of azo groups (-N=N-) as the chromophore.
• C) Triphenylmethane dyes : contain paraquinoid as chromophore. Used for colouring paper
or typewrite ribbons, e.g. malachite green is used for dyeing wool and silk directly and
cotton after mordating with tannin.
• D) Mordant dyes : Fabric is first dipped into a solution of mordant and then into the dye
solution. The color produced depends on the nature of mordant used.
• E) Vat dyes : Water insoluble dyes and are introduced into the fibre in its (soluble )reduced
form, also known as leuco form (colourless). Indigo is a vat dye and is used for dyeing cotton.
• Carbon Dioxide
• It is an acidic oxide of carbon and is used by green plants for photosynthesis.
• It does not help in burning. Air and our breath contain carbon dioxide.
• Thus, when lime water is kept in air or we pass our breath into it, the lime water turns milky.
• Carbon Monoxide
• It is a neutral oxide of air and has more affinity towards haemoglobin than oxygen (about
200 times more).
• That’s why in the environment of carbon monoxide – which is a non- poisonous gas - people
die for the need of oxygen.
• It is dangerous to sleep in an unventilated room with fire burning inside because the fire
produces carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases.
Plaster of Paris
• Plaster of Paris
• It is chemically calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO4.1/2H2O) and is
prepared by heating gypsum – which is calcium sulphate dehydrate
(CaSO4.2H2O) at 373 K.
• On Mixing with water, plaster of Paris further sets into a hard solid, called
gypsum.
• Thus, it is used to plaster fractured bones, for making toys, materials for
decoration and for making surfaces smooth.
Portland Cement
• It is a complex mixture of silicates and aluminates of calcium with small amount of gypsum.
• Raw materials used for the manufacture of Portland cement are limestone and clay.
• The composition of Portland cement is calcium oxide (50-60%), alumina (5-10%), and
magnesium oxide (2-3%).
• Gypsum is added to cement to decrease its rate of setting.
• In cement, if lime is in excess, cement cracks during setting and if lime is less, cement is of
weak strength.
• Mortar a mixture of sand, cement and water is used for joining bricks and plastering walls.
• Concrete—a mixture of gravel, sand, cement and water is used for flooring and making
roads.
• Reinforced Concrete Cement (RCC)— which is concrete with steel bars and wires is used for
constructing roofs, bridges and pillars
Hardening of Oil
• Hardening of Oil (Hydrogenation) Oil, an unsaturated fat when
heated with nickel catalyst and hydrogen gets converted into a solid
mass, called ghee, a saturated fat.
• This process is called hardening of oil and is carried out through
hydrogenation in the presence of nickel as a catalyst.
Propellants
• Fuels used for the propulsion of rockets are called propellants. Generally
propellants are the mixtures of fuel and oxidiser. If both the fuel and
oxidiser are in solid state, the propellants are called solid propellants e.g.
Paraffin + Petroleum nitrate (oxidiser).
• If one or both are in liquid state, the propellants are called liquid
propellants, e.g. liquid O2 and liquid H2. Other examples are alcohals,
liquid ammonia, kerosene, hydrazine with oxidiser, hydrogen peroxide,
nitric acid etc.
• Hybrid Propellants : have a solid fuel and a liquid oxidiser e.g. mixture of
acrylic rubber and liquid dinitrogen tetraoxide.
Explosives
• A reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy that can
produce an explosion if released suddenly, usually accompanied by production of
light, heat, sound and pressure.
• The potential energy stored in an explosive may be
• Chemical energy such as nitroglycerine or grain dust.
• Pressurised gas such as gas cylinder or aerosol can.
• Nuclear energy such as in the fissile isotopes, U-235 and Pu-239.
• Some important explosives are :
• Nitroglycerin : a highly unstable and sensitive liquid.
• Acetone peroxide : A very unstable white organic peroxide.
• TNT : TriNitroToluene : yelllow insensitive polymer that can be melted.
• RDX : Research and Development Explosive; can be used in pure or in plastic
explosive.
Cosmetics
• Creams : Except vanishing creams, all facial creams contains oil
(olive oil, almond oil, mineral oil etc.), waxes (bee wax, spermaceti ,
paraffin) and emulsifiers (bee wax, stearic acid, glycerol
monosterate)
• Vanishing creams consists of stearic acid, water, alkali, glycerine,
preservatives and emulsifiers). Glycerine reduces the dryness.
• Bleaching creams consists of titanium oxide, zinc oxide, hydrogen
peroxide etc which reduces the normal pigmentation i.e. melanin
content of the skin.
Perfumes
• Have pleasant smell because of the presence of esters in them.
• Consists of odoriferous components(essential oils), fixatives (like musk, castor, vanillin) and
solvents like ethyl alcohal and water.
• Components of essential oils are citronellol, nerol, geraniol etc.
• Deodorants : they contain salts of aluminium, iron and zinc which prevent perspiration by
their astringent action.
• Talcom Powder : consists of carbonates of Ca and Mg (for absorbency), oxides of titanium,
zinc and magnesium (for opacity), talc and metallic soaps (to provide slipperiness),
magnesium and zinc stearates ( to impart adhesive property) and boric acid ( for germicidal
and buffering action).
• Baby powder does not have boric acid.

Tuglaq Dynasty
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• After killing Mubarak Shah, Khusru Khan mounted the throne as Sultan
Nasiruddin.
• He ordered mass killing in the Harem of the Sultan and everybody alive was killed.
• Khusru, a Hindu convert, took the revenge of his forceful covert by eliminating the
whole of the Khalji dynasty and this was the end of another dynasty of the Delhi
Sultanate in 1320 AD.
• The Muslims were in abject fear of this Hindu convert followed by a Hindu uprising
in Delhi and all their hopes were now on Ghazi Malik.
Introduction
• The Tughlaqs were a Muslim family of Turkic origin. The dynasty reached its zenith
point between AD 1330 and 1335 when Muhammad Bin Tughlaq led military
campaign.
• Its rule was marked by torture, cruelty and rebellions, resulting in the rapid
disintegration of the dynasty's territorial reach after 1335 AD.
• This dynasty is also known as Qaraunah Turks as the father of Ghiasuddin Tuglaq
was a Qaraunah Turk.
Tuglaq Dynasty
Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq or Ghazi Malik
(1320 – 1325 A.D.)
• Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq or Ghazi Malik was the founder of the Tughluq
dynasty.
• His father was a Turk and mother was a Jat woman of Punjab.
• Ghazi Malik was a general of Alauddin Khalji.
• He was the first sultan who took the title of Ghazi or slayer of infidels.
• Ghazi means 'to carry out a military expedition.
• Slayer of infidels means someone who kills a person who does not follow
the same religion you do.
Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq or Ghazi Malik
(1320 – 1325 A.D.)
• He strengthened the defence of the North-Western
frontier in order to check the Mongol invasions.
and secured Multan, Sindh and Uch for his master.
• His son Fakhr-ud-din Muhammad Jauna Khan defeated
the Kakatiya ruler of Warangal, Prataparudra-Deva II.
• His son Fakhr Malik who later became Muhammad Bin
Tuglaq was in Delhi and was aware of the critical state of
affairs in Delhi.
• He went to Multan secretly and told his father what was
happening in Delhi.
• The father son duo, i.e. Ghazi Malik and Fakhr Malik, both
great warriors, marched towards Delhi to save Delhi from
this Hindu convert devourer.
Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq or Ghazi Malik
(1320 – 1325 A.D.)
• Fearful Khusru Khan (the last king of the Khilji dynasty) with all the troops he
could gather, emptied the treasury and scattered the hoard in among the soldiers.
• The Muslim soldiers took the money but did not take up arms against Ghazi Malik.
• Khusru, with his limited number of Hindu men and a few rebel Muslims tried to
withstand Ghazi Malik, the champion of the Alauddin’s faith.
• The reign of terror ended, and India passed in the hands of another foreign
dynasty.
• Ghazi Malik founded the city of Tughlaqabad.
Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq or Ghazi Malik
(1320 – 1325 A.D.)
• He put down the revolt of Ghiyasuddin Bahadur in Bengal.
• On returning from Bengal, he died in 1325, from the collapse of a wooden
pavilion.
• According to the some historians, he died because of the conspiracy
hatched by his son Jauna Khan because the pavilion was constructed by
the royal architect (Mir Imard) Ahmad.
• Ibn Batuta, the Moroccon traveller, who was in Delhi at that time, opined
that his death was due to sabotage arranged by his son, Jauna Khan.
Domestic and Foreign Policies
• Ghiyas-ud-din reinstated order in his empire.
• He gave more importance to postal arrangements, judicial, irrigation,
agriculture, and police.
• In 1320A.D. he ascended the throne
• He brought Bengal, Utkala or Orissa, and Warangal under his control
• The Mongol leaders who invaded North India were seized and confined by
him.
Domestic and Foreign Policies
• Ghiyas ud-Din Tughluq reintroduced the food market laws which were
earlier implemented by his master.
• He liberalized Alauddin’s administrative policies and took keen interest in
the construction of canals (first sultan to do so).
• He tried to revive all the reforms which were necessary and were earlier
implemented.
• Ghiyas ud-Din Tughluq successfully attempted to bring the peace and
prosperity.
Domestic and Foreign Policies
• Under his elder son Fakhr Malik or Jauna or Ulugh Khan, Deccan
Provinces were recovered.
• He re-establish the authority of warangal (Kakatiyas) and Madurai
(Pandyas).
• He had a troublesome relationship with Shaikh Nizamuddin Aulia.
Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq (1325-1361 A.D.)
• In 1325 A.D. Jauna khan, the crown prince
sworn the title Muhammad-bin-Tughluq.
• Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq stood for the
administrative and political unity of India.
• In 1327 A.D. he captured Warangal.
• Jauna Khan succeeded his father in AD
1325 under the title of Muhammad- binTughlaq.
Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq
(1325-1361 A.D.)
• He was the most learned scholars of his time.
• He knew both Arabic and Persian and had comprehensive knowledge of
philosophy, astronomy, logic, mathematics and physical science.
• Toghan Timur (AD 1341), who came to seek permission to rebuild
Buddhist Monasteries, in the Himalayan region which were destroyed
during the crucial expedition.
• The sultan gave the permission and sent Ibn Batuta to the court of the
Chinese emperor in 1347.
Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq
(1325-1361 A.D.)
• Ibn Batutah was a traveller from Morocco.
• He came to India in 1333 and was appointed as the chief Qazi of Delhi for
8 years by Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq and recorded the contemporary
Indian scene in his Safarnamah (called Rehla) in Arabic language.
• Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq is also known as wisest fool because of five
reasons.
• To fill the empty treasury, he raised taxes in the Doab region.
1. Taxes in the Doab region
• Instead of actual produce standard yield was taken into account based on
the officially assumed prices.
• Unfortunately, the rain failed and there was a terrible famine in the
country. The taxes were collected rigorously. The peasants revolted in the
doab. Later, several measures were taken by the Sultan.
• He created an agricultural department, "Diwan-i-Kohi" under the charge of
"Diwan-i-Amir-i-Koht" to bring barren land under cultivation.
• Sondhar (agricultural) loans were advanced to dig wells and to buy seed
and implements.
• Shiqdars were appointed and given large sums of money to implement the
scheme, but they were incompetent and the scheme failed.
• However, the scheme became a part of the agricultural policy of the
Mughals.
• Many people ran away to the forests to avoid heavy taxes due to which
cultivation was neglected and severe food shortage occurred.
2. Transfer of Capital (1327)
• It appears that the Sultan wanted to make Devagiri second capital so that
he might be able to control south India better.
• Devagiri was named as Daulatabad present in MHA aurangabad districts.
• However, after a couple of years, Muhammad Tughlaq decided to abandon
Daulatabad largely because he soon found that just as he could not control
south India from Delhi, he could not control North from Daulatabad.
3. Introduction of Token
Currency (1330)
• Muhammad Tughlaq decided to introduce
bronze coins, which were to have the
same value as the silver coins.
• Muhammad Tughlaq might have been
successful if he could prevent people
from forging the new coins.
• He was not able to to do so and so on the
new coins began to be greatly devalued in
markets.
• One of the most unique reforms of the sultan is said to be inspired by the
introduction of paper token currency in China and Iran.
• In his first reform, he replaced the old gold and silver coins weighing 175 grains by
new coins
 Dinar gold coins - 200 grains
 Adali silver coins - 140 grains
• Then he ordered the Tanka to be minted in bronze instead of silver and fixed the
value of the new bronze coins at par with the silver tanka.
• The value of coins dropped; hence he had to withdraw the token currency.
• To conquer Khurasan, Iraq, and Transoxiana, he raised an
army of 3,70,000 men.
• But the scheme was abandoned as conditions in Iraq
improved.
4. Khurasan Expedition
• The plan for the conquest of Karajal (Kumaon hills) also met with a
disastrous end.
• Mohammed-bin-Tughluq’s national treasure had a great burden due to the
policy of huge presents given to Tamashirin, the Mongol leader in order to
avoid Mongol Invasion.
• Mohammed-bin-Tughluq’s domestic policies were good but due to faulty
implementation measures, they failed.
5. Conquest of Karajal
(Kumaon hills)
• The decline of the Delhi Sultanate is claimed due to his hasty decisions
and defective policy implementation.
• During the last days, the whole of the South India became independent
and three major states Empire of Vijayanagara, The Bahamani kingdom
and Sultnate of Madura was founded.
• He built the fortress of Adilabad and city of Jahanpanah.
Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq (1325-1361 A.D.)
Reforms and Experiments
• Sultan lacked political judgement and common sense and, rather obsesses
with his theoretical knowledge, indulged in lofty theories and visionary
projects, which failed.
• Delhi Sultanate has reached its zenith during the reign of Mohd. Bin
Tuglaq. His empire was divided into 23 provinces.
Firoz Tughlaq
(1351-1 388 A.D.)
• In 1351A.D. Firoz Tughlaq was the son of Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq’s younger
brother. He succeeded the throne.
• He was not a distinguished military leader his campaigns are as follows:
• He led two unsuccessful campaigns into Bengal against Haji Iliyas (Shams-uddin Iliyas Shah) and Sikandar Shah.
• Tartar Khan commanded the army.
• The Rai of Jajnagar (modern Orissa) and Nagarkot and the ruler of Sind (Jam
Babaniya) surrendered before the sultan.
• He also indirectly acknowledged the independence of the Balmani king by
receiving embassy from him.
Administrative Reforms
• He withdrew all Taquavi (agricultural) loans granted by Mohammed-binTughlaq.
• He raised the salary of the revenue officers.
• He brought to an end to all unlawful and unjust taxes.
• He took steps to translate Hindu religious texts and Sanskrit books on
music into Persian.
Administrative Reforms
• He collected four important taxes which are:
 Kharaj- 1/10 of the produce of the land
 Khams- 1/5 of the war booty
 Jizya-Poll Tax/ Tax by non muslims even by Brahmins.
 Zakat-Tax on Muslims for specific religious purposes. (2.5%)
Administrative Reforms
• He constructed 150 wells, 100 bridges, and 50 dams, and also dug many
irrigation canals.
• Construction of canals for irrigation from
 Yamuna to the city of Hissar
 From the Sutlej to the Ghaggar
 From the Ghaggar to Firuzabad
 From Mandvi and Sirmour Hills to Hansi in Haryana.
Administrative Reforms
• He constructed towns like Firozabad, Hissar, Jaunpur, and Fatehabad.
• Built his capital Firozabad ( the present day Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi) and
to beautify it, brought 2 Ashokan pillars, one from Topra in Ambala and
other from Meerut.
• He rebuilt two storeys of QutubMinar which were damaged by lightening
in 1368 AD.
• Firoz banned all kinds of damages and torture.
Administrative Reforms
• He carried out many reforms and works of public utility with the help of
his able minister - Khan-i-Jehan Maqbool, a Hindu convert.
• He revived the Jagir system (grant of lands) which had been abolished by
Alauddin and granted it to his military officials in lieu of cash salaries.
• The iqtas granted and the post of officials and soldiers was made
hereditary not only in civil offences but also in army.
• This reduced the competent men and has negative impact on the army.
Administrative Reforms
• He organized the institution of slavery into a system and employed them
in Royal Karkhanas and other production activities.
• A separate department, Diwan-i- Bandagan, was established for the
welfare of the people.
• He established a charity bureau called Diwan-i-Khairat for the help of poor
persons, widows and or phans and through which pecuniary help was
distributed for the marriage of poor Muslim girls.
• A charitable hospital called Darul-Shafa was set up at Delhi was free
medicine and diet was supplied.
Administrative Reforms
• He also established Diwan-i-lstibqaq to give financial aid to the poor.
• Foreign Policy
 Firoz Tughlaq surrounded Bengal in 1353 A.D. and 1359 A.D.
 He seized Jainagar.
 He devastated the Jagannath Temple at Puri.
• Firoz proved his prominence by
 His generous measures and contributions to the affluence of the people.
 Futuhat-i-Firoz Shahi is an autobiography of Firoz Tughlaq.
 He patronized scholar Zia-ud-din Barani and wrote Tarikh-i-Ferozshahi and
Fatwa-i-Jahandari.
 During his reign, a number of Sanskrit books on medicine, science and arts were
translated into Persian.
 Khwaja Abdul Malik Isami wrote Futuh-us-Sulatin.
 Kutab- Feroz Shahi – a book which dealt with Physics
 He also introduced two new coins- Adha (50% jital) and bikh (25% jital)
 Also issued Shashgani, a silver coin.
Later Tughlaqs
• Successors of Firoz
 Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq Shah II
 Abu Bakr Shah,
 Nasir-ud-din Mohammed Tughlaq
End of Tughlug Dynasty
• The successors of Firoz were not very strong or competent.
• By the end of the 14th century, most of the territories became
independent.
• The Malwa, Gujarat and Sharqi (Jaunpur) Kingdoms broke away from the
Sultanate.
• Only Punjab and Delhi remained under the Tughlaqs.
• Timur’s invasion took place during the Tughlug period
Timur’s Invasion (1398 A.D.)
• The fabulous wealth of India attracted Timur the ruler of Samarqand.
• During the period of Nasir-ud-din Mohammed Tughlaq, he invaded India.
• In 1398 A.D. Timur captured Delhi and caused the annihilation of the
Tughlaq dynasty by pillaging and slaughtering people.

MIXTURES
By Dr Vipan Goyal

HOMOGENOUS MIXTURE
• A homogeneous mixture is a mixture where the components that
make up the mixture are uniformly distributed throughout the
mixture. The composition of the mixture is the same throughout.
 Sugar water
 Salt water
 Vodka
 vinegar
HETROGENOUS MIXTURE
• A heterogeneous mixture is a mixture where the components of
the mixture are not uniform or have localized regions with different
properties.
• Different samples from the mixture are not identical to each other.
• There are always two or more phases in a heterogeneous mixture,
where you can identify a region with properties that are distinct
from those of another region, even if they are the same state of
matter (e.g., liquid, solid).
SOLUTION
• TRUE SOLUTION (less than 10^-9 or 10^-7)
• True Solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances
in which substance dissolved (solute) in solvent has the particle size
of less than 10-9 m or 1 nm.
• Simple solution of sugar in water is an example of true solution.
• Particles of true solution cannot be filtered through filter paper and
are not visible to naked eye.
• Particles do not settle down
COLLOIDS
• Can' see with naked eye , between 1nm to 100nm
• A colloid is a homogeneous solution with intermediate particle size
between a solution and a suspension.
• Colloid particles may be seen in a beam of light such as dust in air in
a "shaft" of sunlight (called tyndall effect). Milk, fog and smoke are
examples of colloids.
• It can’t be filtered through filter paper as the size of pores are large
while it can be filtered through parchment paper or animal
membrane as the size of pores are smaller than filter paper.
SUSPENSION
• MORE THAN 100nm
• Heterogeneous mixture in which particle size of one or more
components is greater than 1000nm or greater than 10-5 cm.
• Example- Mud dissolved in water
• Particles of suspension are big enough to be seen with naked eye.
Brownian movement
• Brownian movement or motion, zigzag, irregular motion exhibited
by minute particles of matter when suspended in a fluid.
Electrophoresis
• The movement of colloidal particles
under the action of electric field is
known as electrophoresis.
• If the colloidal particles move
towards the positive electrode
(anode) they carry negative charge.
On the other hand if the sol particles
migrate towards negative electrode
(cathode), they are positively
charged.
Dialysis
• The process of separating the particles of colloids from those
crystalloids of mixture through animal membrane or
parchment membrane is known as Dialysis.
• It is the process of purification of colloidal solution.
Coagulation ( Flocculation)
• The colloidal particles are either positively or negatively charged
particles.
• When an electrolyte is added to colloidal solution, the particles of
the colloidal solution take up the oppositively charged ion of the
added electrolyte and get neutralised.
• The ion responsible for the neutralisation of charge on colloidal
particles is called the coagulating ion or flocculation ion and this
process is called coagulation.
Characteristics of Different Solutions
EMULSION/ COLLOIDS
• An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally
immiscible
• It contains two phases, dispersed phase and dispersion medium or
continuous medium, in which both phase are in liquid state.
• Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of
matter called colloids.

Effects of temperature and pressure on
solubility of gases and solid in liquids
• TEMPERATURE
 Solubility of solids in liquids are directly proportional to temperature
 Gases are indirectly proportional to temperature. As on increasing
temperature, solubility of gases in liquids decreases.
• PRESSURE
 Solubility of solids in liquids does not have any effect of pressure
 Solubility of gases in liquids is directly proportional to the pressure
applied on the gases and liquids mixture. As on increasing pressure,
solubility of the gases in liquids increases.
SUBLIMATION
• SUBLIMATION
 It is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the
gas phase and viceversa, without passing through the
intermediate liquid phase. Ex:- ammonium chloride (NH4Cl),
Camphor, Iodine, Naphthalene and Anthracene.
CENTRIFUGATION
• CENTRIFUGATION
 Centrifugation is a technique which involves the application of
centrifugal force to separate particles from a solution according
to their size, shape, density, viscosity of the medium and rotor
speed.
 Ex:- centrifugal separator – used in dairy industry for checking
the amount of fat in milk or any kind of adulteration by
measuring the amount of fat produced by it.
CHROMATOGRAPHY
• A technique for the separation of mixture by passing it in solution
or suspension through a medium in which the components move at
different rates.
• PAPER CHROMATOGRAPHY OF CHLOROPHYLL
DISTILLATION
It is the process of separating the components or substances
from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and
condensation and then collecting the resultant hot vapors.
FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION
• Fractional is the separation of
a mixture into its component
parts, or fractions. Chemical
compounds are separated by
heating them to a
temperature at which one or
more fractions of the mixture
will vaporize.
CRYSTALLIZATION
• It is the technique based on the principle of solubility: compounds
(solute) tends to be more soluble in hot liquids (solvents) than they
are in cold liquids.
• If saturated hot solution is allowed to cool, the solute is no longer
soluble in solvent and gets separate out, in the form of crystals.
SEDIMENTATION PROCESS
• Sedimentation is the process of allowing particles in suspension in
water to settle out of the suspension under the effect of gravity.
• The particles that settle out from the suspension become sediment,
and in water treatment is known as sludge.
• The clear liquid at top can be gently transferred into another beaker
and this process is known as decantation.
MATTER
• In general it exists in 3 states i.e.,
• Solid
• liquid
• gas.
• Now-a-days there is a discussion on two more states of matter i.e.,
Plasma (Ionised gases containing super energetic and super excited
particles and Bose-Einstein condensates or BEC (a gas at super low
temperatures with extremely low density)
BOILING POINT
• Boiling point is the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the
external pressure.
 Boiling point of water is 100°C.
 Phase changes from liquid to gas.
 It gets affected by change in external pressure.
 The boiling point increases in the presence of impurities. That's why boiling
point of sea water is more than the boiling point of pure water (as the
former contains impurity).
 • It usually decreases at high altitudes, that's why at high altitudes, the
boiling point of water is less than 100°C and more time is required to cook a
food.
MELTING POINT
• Melting point is the temperature at which solid and liquid phases of
a substance are in equilibrium i.e. The constant temperature at
which a solid becomes liquid upon absorbing heat under normal
pressure.
 For ice, the melting point is 0°C or 273K.
 It decrease in the presence of impurity
 Phase changes from solid to liquid.
 Does not get affected by change in external pressure.
Freezing Point
• The constant temperature at which a liquid changes into a
solid by giving out heat energy is called freezing point of that
liquid.
• Freezing point of water is 0 degree Centigrade.
Evaporation
• The process of conversion of a liquid into its vapours at room
temperature is called Evaporation.
• It causes cooling.
• Example : Evaporation of sea water in summer from ponds,
wells and lakes.
• Preparation of common salt from sea water by evaporation of
water.
Vapour Pressure
• The pressure exerted by the vapours of liquid in equilibrium with
liquid at a given temperature is called vapour pressure.
• It depends upon a) its nature B) Temperature
• Higher the vapor pressure of a particular liquid lesser will be the
magnitude of intermolecular forces present in the molecules.
• Vapor pressure of liquid decreases with increase in temperature.

Dynasties
By Dr Vipan Goyal

THE SAYYID DYNASTY
(1414-1451 A.D.)
• The Sayyid Dynasty was founded by Khizr Khan, who was the governor of
Multan and Timur's deputy in India.
• This dynasty ruled for 37 years from 1414 to 1451 AD by four rulers-
• Khizr Khan,
• Mubarak,
• Muhammad Shah,
• Alam Shah.
Khizr Khan (1414- 1421 A.D.)
• He was the founder of Sayyid Dynasty and ruled as a
deputy of Timur’s son and successor, Shah Rukh.
• He did not swear any royal title.
• He was the Governor of Multan.
• He took advantage of the disordered situation in India
after Timur’s invasion.
• In 1414 A.D. he occupied the throne of Delhi.
• He brought parts of Surat, Dilapur, and Punjab under his
control.
• But he lost Bengal, Deccan, Gujarat, Jaunpur, Khandesh
and Malwa.
• In 1421 he died.
• Mubarak Shah Khizr Khan’s son succeeded him.

LODI DYNASTY (1451 to 1526)
• The Lodhi Dynasty under the Delhi Sultanate was the first Afghan Pashtun
Dynasty in India who ruled from AD 1451 to 1526.
• This dynasty replaced the Sayyid Dynasty and it was a period of reforms in
administration, strengthening the army, gearing up the machinery of land
revenue administration, expansion and improvement of the cultivation
and welfare of the people.
LODI DYNASTY (1451 to 1526)
• The entire 15th century saw the
power of Delhi vanished, following
the collapse of the Tughlaq Dynasty,
after the invasion of Timur.
• The Sayyid utterly failed but Lodi
Afghans succeeded.
• The last feeble Sayyid was
supplanted by Bahlol Lodi in 1451.
Bahlul Lodi (1451 -1489 A.D.)

• Bahlul Lodi was a wise ruler, he never sat on the throne and he used to sit
on the carpet in front of the throne with his nobles to gain their
recognition and support.
• He was succeeded by his able son Nizam Shah under the title of Sultan
Sikandar Shah in AD 1489.
Sikandar Lodi(1489-1517 A.D.)
• Sikandar Lodi was the second son of Bahlol, so naturally
there was a power struggle between him and his elder
brother Barbak Shah, who was then viceroy of Jaunpur.
• But since, Sikandar was nominated as heir apparent by
his father, there was no bloodshed and Barbak Shah kept
ruling Jaunpur.
• Sikandar ascended the throne in 1489 AD.

known to have burnt alive a Hindu Brahmin who
preached that “Islam and Hindu are both ways
acceptable to God“.
• He razed temples such as Jwalamukhi temple at
Nagarkot.

Skeletal System
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Parts of the skeletal system:
Bones
Joints
Cartilage
Ligaments (bone to bone )
Tendon (bone to muscles)
Axial Skeleton Upper Portion
• It consists of 80 bones along the central axis of
the human body
• It is composed of six parts: skull, ossicle, hyoid
bone, rib cage, sternum, and vertebral
• 29 bones present in skull. 8 protects the brain .
There are 14 bones which form the face. Six
ossicles and one hyoid bone.
• Ribs: 12 pairs/24 total
• 11th and 12th pair are called floating ribs as they
are not attached to bones.
Appendicular Skeleton Diagram
• Composed of 126 bones in the
human body.
• Appendicular is an adjective derived
from the noun appendage.
• This means that these structures are
joined to something larger.
Functions of bones
• Support of the body – Internal framework that supports the body and
cradles its soft organs.
• Protection of soft organs – Ex: skull – brain, rib cage – lungs and heart
• Storage of minerals and fats –
 fat is stored in the internal cavities of bone
 Stores minerals such as calcium and phosphorous.
• Blood cell formation
 Hematopoiesis, occurs within the marrow cavities of certain bones.
BONES OF THE HUMAN BODY
• The skeleton has 206 bones. (during childhood- 300 bones) and
have 639 muscles.
• Two basic types of bone tissue :-
 Compact bone – Homogeneous
 Spongy bone – Small needle like pieces of bone.
• Many open spaces.
Bone marrow
• Bone marrow is a semi-solid tissue
which may be found within the
spongy or cancellous portions of
bones.
• In birds and mammals, bone
marrow is the primary site of new
blood cell production or
hematopoiesis.
• It is composed of hematopoietic
cells, marrow adipose tissue, and
supportive stromal cells.
Types of bone cells
Osteocytes
• Mature bone
cells
Osteoblasts
• Bone-forming
cells
Osteoclasts
• Bone-destroying
cells, breakdown
bone matrix for
remodeling and
release of
calcium
Bone fracture: A break in the bone
Types of bone fractures
Closed (simple) fracture
break that does not
penetrate the skin
Open (compound) fracture
broken bone penetrates
through the skin
SKULL
• The brain is protected by the bones of the
skull and by a covering of three thin
membranes called meninges.
• The brain is also cushioned and protected
by cerebrospinal fluid.
• Two sets of bones are:
 Cranium
 Facial bones
• Bones are joined by sutures, skull is made
up by 29 bones. The only bone that can
move is Mandible.
VERTEBRAL COLUMN
• Vertebrae separated by
intervertebral discs.
• The spine has a normal curvature.
• Each vertebrae is given a name
according to its location.
• The human spinal column is made
up of 33 bones
VERTEBRAL COLUMN
• 7 vertebrae in the cervical region, 12 in
the thoracic region, 5 in the lumbar
region, 5 in the sacral region and 4 in the
coccygeal region.
• After fusion they became 26.
• Formula C7 T12 L5 S5(1) C4 (1)
• First vertebral column is Atlas which is
connected with skull.
Joints
• The study of Joints is called Arthrology
Classification of Joints
• According to the structural classification of joints, they are divided
into 3 types, namely:
1. Fibrous Joints/Fixed Joints
2. Cartilaginous Joints/Slightly Moveable Joints/Imperfect Joints
3. Synovial Joints/Freely Movable Joints/Perfect Joints
Fibrous Joints/Fixed Joints
• Fixed joints, also called immovable joints, are found where bones
are not flexible.
• No movements occur.
• A prominent example of a fixed joint is the skull, which is made up
of a number of fused bones.
• Other examples include the upper jaw, rib cage, backbone, and
pelvic bone, etc.
Fibrous Joints/Fixed Joints
Cartilaginous Joints/Slightly
Moveable Joints/Imperfect Joints
• Cartilaginous joints are partly movable joints comprising of
symphysis or synchondrosis joints.
• These joints occur only in those regions where the connection
between the articulating bones is made up of cartilage.
• Synchondrosis are temporary cartilaginous joints which are present
in young children and last until the end of their puberty.
• Examples include the pubic symphysis, spinal column and the
ribcage.
Cartilaginous Joints/Slightly
Moveable Joints/Imperfect Joints
Synovial Joints/Freely Movable
Joints/Perfect Joints
• The synovial joints are the most common type of joint because this
joint helps us to perform a wide range of motions such as walking,
running, typing and more. Synovial joints are flexible, movable, can
slide over one another, rotatable and so on.
• These joints are found in our shoulder joint, neck joint, knee joint,
wrist joint, etc. There are types of freely movable joint and are
mentioned below with the examples.
Synovial Joints/Freely
Movable Joints/Perfect Joints
Ball and Socket Joints
Pivotal Joints
Hinge Joints
Saddle Joints
Gliding Joints
Synovial Joints/Freely Movable
Joints/Perfect Joints
1. Ball and Socket Joints
 Here, one bone is hooked into the
hollow space of another bone. This
type of joint helps in rotatory
movement. An example ball and
socket joint are the shoulders.
2. Pivotal Joints
 In this type of joint, one bone has
tapped into the other in such a way
that full rotation is not possible.
This joint aid in sideways and backforth movement. An example of a
pivotal joint is the neck.
Synovial Joints/Freely Movable
Joints/Perfect Joints
3. Hinge Joints
 Hinge joints are like door hinges,
where only back and forth movement
is possible. Example of hinge joints is
the ankle, elbows, and knee joints.
4. Saddle Joints
 Saddle joint is the biaxial joint that
allows the movement on two planes–
flexion/extension and
abduction/adduction. For example,
the thumb is the only bone in the
human body having a saddle joint.
Synovial Joints/Freely Movable
Joints/Perfect Joints
5. Gliding Joints
 Gliding joints are a common type of
synovial joint. It is also known as a plane
or planar joint.
 This joint permit two or more round or
flat bones to move freely together
without any rubbing or crushing of
bones.
 This joint is mainly found in those
regions where the two bones meet and
glide on one another in any of the
directions.
 The lower leg to the ankle joint and the
forearm to wrist joint are the two main
examples of gliding joints.
Inflammatory Conditions with Joints
Inflammatory Conditions with Joints
• Arthritis – Inflammatory or degenerative diseases of joints.
• Osteoarthritis-
 Most common chronic arthritis
 Probably related to normal aging processes.
• Rheumatoid arthritis
 Autoimmune diseases- the immune system attacks the joints.
 Symptoms begin with bilateral inflammation of certain joints
 Often leads to deformities.
Inflammatory Conditions with Joints
• Gout arthritis
 Inflammation of joints is caused by a deposition of uric acid
crystals from the blood.
 Can usually be controlled with diet.
• Osteoporosis :
 Loss of bone density due to excessive absorption of Ca and
Phosphorous from the bone.
Important Bones
• Knee- Patella
• Thigh- Femur (largest bone)
• Ankle- Tarsal
• Fingers- Phalanges
• Wrist- Carpals
• Upper arms- Humerus
• Palm- Meta carpal
• Bones in ear- Malleus, Incus, Stapes (smallest bone)

Important Points
• Largest muscle : Gluteus maximus ( Buttock muscle)
• Bone forming cells are called Osteoblasts.
• Bone from Pectoral Girdle joined with forelimb is called
Humerus.
• Bone from Pelvic Girdle joined with hindlimb is called Femur.
Facts
• Sternum is absent in Fishes.
• Massetters of Jaw is strongest muscle.
• Birds have spongy bones with air filled spaces are called Pneumatic bones.
• Rigor mortis is the state of body stiffening after death of individual.
• Thickest layer of skin is found in Sole.
• The hardest part of human body is Enamel.
• Keratin protein is present in skin.
• Bone found in the leg of human body is hollow.
• Hump of camel is made up of adipose tissue.
Muscular System – Muscle Types
• Muscle is a specialized tissue of mesodermal origin.
• Mesodermal i.e. the middle layer of cells or tissues of an embryo,
or the parts derived from this (e.g. cartilage, muscles, and bone)
• About 40-50 per cent of the body weight of a human adult is
contributed by muscles.
• They have special properties like excitability, contractility,
extensibility and elasticity.
Muscular System – Muscle Types
• Muscles have been classified using
different criteria, namely location,
appearance and nature of regulation
of their activities. Based on their
location, three types of muscles are:
1. Skeletal
2. Visceral [the internal organs in the
main cavities of the body]
3. Cardiac
Skeletal Muscles
• Skeletal muscles are closely associated with the skeletal
components of the body. They have a striped
appearance under the microscope and hence are
called striated muscles.
• As their activities are under the voluntary control of
the nervous system, they are known as voluntary
muscles They are primarily involved in locomotory
actions and changes of body postures.
• Each organized skeletal muscle in our body is made of a
number of muscle bundles or fascicles held together
by a common connective tissue layer called fascia.
Skeletal Muscles
• Each muscle bundle contains a number of
muscle fibres. Each muscle fibre is lined by
the plasma membrane
called sarcolemma enclosing the
sarcoplasm.
• The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e.,
sarcoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fibres
is the store house of calcium ions.
• A characteristic feature of the muscle fibre
is the presence of a large number of
parallelly arranged filaments in the
sarcoplasm called myofilaments or
myofibrils.
Skeletal Muscles
• Each myofibril has alternate dark and light
bands on it. The striated appearance is due
to the distribution pattern of two
important proteins : Actin and Myosin.
• Actin and myosin are polymerized proteins
with contractility.
• A motor neuron carries signal to the
muscle fibre which generates an action
potential in it.
• This causes the release of Ca++ from
sarcoplasmic reticulum.
Skeletal Muscles
• Ca++ activates actin which binds to the myosin
head to form a cross bridge.
• These cross bridges pull the actin filaments
causing them to slide over the myosin filaments
and thereby causing contraction.
• Ca++ are then returned to sarcoplasmic
reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross
bridges are broken and the muscles relax.
• Muscles are classified as Red and White fibres
based primarily on the amount of red coloured
myoglobin pigment in them.
Visceral Muscles
• Visceral muscles are located in the inner walls
of hollow visceral organs of the body like the
alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc.
• They do not exhibit any striation and are
smooth in appearance. Hence, they are
called smooth muscles (non-striated muscle).
• Their activities are not under the voluntary
control of the nervous system and are
therefore known as involuntary muscles.
• They assist, for example, in the transportation
of food through the digestive tract and
gametes through the genital tract.
Cardiac Muscles
• As the name suggests, Cardiac
muscles are the muscles of heart.
• Many cardiac muscle cells assemble
in a branching pattern to form a
cardiac muscle.
• Based on appearance, cardiac
muscles are striated.
• They are involuntary in nature as the
nervous system does not control
their activities directly.

COMBUSTION
and FLAME
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• A chemical process in which a substance
reacts with oxygen and give off heat is known
as combustion.
• The substance that undergoes combustion is
called as combustible or fuel.
• The fuel can be in the form of solid, liquid, or
gas.
• During the combustion, light is also given off
either in the form of a flame or as a glow.
Combustion and Flame
• The substances which vaporize during burning
time, give flames.
• There are three different zones of a flame dark
zone, luminous zone and non-luminous zone.
• Innermost Part- which is black due to the
presence of unburned carbon particles- has
lowest temperature.
• Middle part – is yellow due to incomplete of
fuel.
• Outermost part- which is blue due to complete
combustion of fuel is the hottest and used by
goldsmith to heat the gold.
Combustion and Flame
• Different substances catch fire at different temperatures.
• The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is known
as its ignition temperature.
• A match contains antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate.
• The rubbing surface of match contains powdered glass and a little
red phosphorus.
• Red phosphorus is much less dangerous.
Combustion and Flame
• When the match stick is struck against the rubbing surface, some red
phosphorus gets converted into white phosphorus; the process
immediately reacts with potassium chlorate present in the matchstick
head and produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide; likewise,
combustion starts.
• The substances, which have very low ignition temperature and can easily
catch fire with a flame, are known as inflammable substances. E. g. petrol,
alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), etc.
Fire Extinguisher
• Water is the most common
fire extinguisher.
• Water, as fire extinguisher,
works only when things like
wood and paper are on fire.
• If electrical equipment is on
fire, water may conduct
electricity and damage those
trying to douse the fire.
Fire Extinguisher
• Water is also not a good
extinguisher for fires
involving oil and petrol.
• For fires that involve
electrical equipment and
inflammable materials
such as petrol, Carbon
Dioxide (CO2) is the best
extinguisher.
Fire Extinguisher
• One of the ways to get CO2 is to release plenty of dry powder of
chemicals such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium
bicarbonate.
• Phosphorus burns in air at room temperature.
• The amount of heat energy produced on complete combustion of 1
kg of a fuel is known as its calorific value.
• The calorific value of a fuel is measured in a unit called kilojoule per
kg (kJ/kg).
Fire Extinguisher
• Water extinguishes fire because as it evaporates, the vapours surround the
burning substance, cutting off the oxygen supply, thus inhibiting burning process.
• Hot water will extinguish fire more quickly than cold water as hot water will
evaporate faster.
• In case of electrical or oil (petrol) fires, water cannot be used as extinguisher. This
is because water is a conductor of electricity and heavier than oil. Thus, oil floats
over it and continues to burn.
• Carbon dioxide, which is generated by the reaction of baking soda with acid, is
used extinguish electrical or oil fires.
• Quality of petrol is measured in terms of octane number and that of diesel in
terms of cetane number.
Calorific Values of Different Fuels
Fuel Calorific Value (kJ/kg)
Cow dung cake 6000-8000
Wood 17000-22000
Coal 25000-33000
Petrol 45000
Kerosene 45000
Diesel 45000
Calorific Values of Different Fuels
Fuel Calorific Value (kJ/kg)
Methane 50000
CNG 50000
LPG 55000
Biogas 35000-40000
Hydrogen 150000
Methane 50000
Global issues
• Combustion of most fuels releases carbon dioxide in the environment.
• Increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is most likely
causes global warming.
• The rise in temperature of the atmosphere of the earth is known as Global
Warming.
• Global warming causes melting of polar glaciers, which leads to a rise in
the sea level that ultimately causing floods in the coastal regions.
• Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in rain water and form acids; such
type of rain is known as acid rain.

Circulatory
System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Circulatory System
• William Harvey discovered the circulation of blood.
• two types - open or closed.
• In Open circulatory system blood pumped by the heart passes
through large vessels into open spaces or body cavities called
sinuses. E.g. arthropods and mollusks
• In closed circulatory system blood pumped by the heart is always
circulated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is
considered to be more advantageous as the flow of fluid can be
more precisely regulated. E.g. Annelids and chordates
Circulatory System
Circulatory System
• All vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart.
• Fishes have a 2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle.
• Amphibians and the reptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-
chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle, whereas
crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a 4-chambered heart with
two atria and two ventricles.
• In fishes the heart pumps out deoxygenated blood which is
oxygenated by the gills and supplied to the body parts from where
deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart (single circulation).
Circulatory System
• In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood
from the gills/lungs/skin and the right atrium gets the deoxygenated blood
from other body parts. However, they get mixed up in the single ventricle
which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double circulation).
• In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood received by
the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of the same
sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two separate
circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these
animals have double circulation.( pulmonary and systemic)
• Animals such as sponges and Hydra do not possess any circulatory
system.
Human Circulatory System
What is the circulatory system?
• The circulatory system carries blood and dissolved substances to
and from different places in the body.
• The Heart has the job of pumping these things around the body.
The Heart pumps blood and substances around the body in tubes
called blood vessels. The Heart and blood vessels together make up
the Circulatory System.

BLOOD CIRCULATION IN HEART
• Heart, the mesodermally derived organ [the middle layer of cells or
tissues of an embryo, or the parts derived from this (e.g. cartilage,
muscles, and bone)], is situated in the thoracic cavity, in between
the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left.
• A thin, muscular wall called the interatrial septum separates the
right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled, the inter-ventricular
septum, separates the left and the right ventricles.
• The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also separated by
a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum
BLOOD CIRCULATION IN HEART
BLOOD CIRCULATION IN HEART
• The opening between the right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded
by a valve formed of three muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve,
whereas a bicuspid or mitral valve guards the opening between the left
atrium and the left ventricle.
• The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the pulmonary artery
and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves.
• The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in one direction, i.e.,
from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary
artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward flow
BLOOD CIRCULATION IN HEART
BLOOD CIRCULATION IN HEART
• The deoxygenated blood is transported to heart right atrium by vena cava (longest
vein).
• The high pressure at right atrium causes tricuspid valve to open, the valves get
relaxed and blood transfers to right ventricle. Then, again the high pressure is
created at the right ventricle, it relaxes and blood transfer through pulmonary
arteries to lungs.
• Where the deoxygenated blood gets oxygen and oxygenated.
• The oxygenated blood is transferred by pulmonary veins to left atrium when the
left atrium get contracted, pressure get built up and the blood transferred to left
ventricles through mitral or bicuspid valves.
• From left ventricle it transfers to all the body parts by aorta (longest artery).
Human Heart Chambers
Animal and heart chambers
1. Left Atrium: Takes oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it
into the left ventricle.
2. Left Ventricle: Pumps the oxygen-rich blood through the aorta
which sends it out into the body.
3. Right Atrium: Takes the used blood from the body that no longer
has oxygen and pumps it into the right ventricle.
4. Right Ventricle: Pumps the oxygen-less blood into the lungs where
it picks up oxygen again.
Right side of the heart
• Blood enters the heart through two large
veins, the inferior and superior vena cava,
emptying oxygen- poor blood from the
body into the right atrium of the heart.
• As the atrium contracts, blood flows from
your right atrium into your right ventricle
through the open tricuspid valve.
• When the ventricle is full, the tricuspid
valve shuts, as the ventricle contracts,
blood leaves the heart through the
pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery
and to the lungs where it is oxygenated.
Left side of the heart
• The pulmonary vein empties oxygenrich blood from the lungs into the left
atrium of the heart.
• As the atrium contracts, blood flows
from your left atrium into your left
ventricle through the open mitral valve.
• When the ventricle is full, the mitral
valve shuts.
• As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves
the heart through the aortic valve, into
the aorta and to the body.
The Aorta
• The largest artery in the body, originating
from the left ventricle of the heart and
extending down to the abdomen, where it
branches of into two smaller arteries. The
aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all
parts of the body.
• Blood from the heart gets around the body
through blood vessels
• There are three types of blood vessels:
1. Artery
2. Vein
3. Capillary
Arteries
• The only artery in the
body which carried
deoxygenated blood
is called pulmonary
artery.
Veins
• The only artery which
carries oxygenated
blood is called the
pulmonary veins
Capillaries
• A collection of
capillaries is known as
a capillary bed.
Difference- Arteries, veins & capillaries
PACEMAKER OF THE HEART
• The SINOATRIAL NODE, also referred
to as the pacemaker of the heart,
coordinates heart contractions.
• The ATRIOVENTRICLE NODE lies on
the right side of the partition that
divides the atria, near the bottom of
the right atrium.
• When the impulses generated by the
SA node reach the AV node, they are
delayed for about a tenth of a second.
PACEMAKER OF THE HEART
• This delay allows the atria to contract, therby emptying blood into the
ventricles.
• Heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of
contractions of the heart per unit of time, typically beats per minute. The
heart rate can vary from 60 to 90 beats per minute. Average rate is 72
beats per minute. At this rate, a complete cardiac cycle takes roughly 0.8
seconds to complete.
• A healthy blood pressure reading should have lower than 120/80 mmHg.
Normal blood pressure is less than 120mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg
diastolic.
Cardiac Cycle and Blood Pressure
Heartbeat
• During each cardiac cycle two prominent
sounds are produced which can be easily
heard through a stethoscope. The first
heart sound (lub) is associated with the
closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid
valves whereas the second heart sound
(dub) is associated with the closure of
the semilunar valves.
Electrocardiograph (ECG)
• To obtain a standard ECG, a
patient is connected to the
machine with three electrical
leads (one to each wrist and
to the left ankle) that
continuously monitor the
heart activity.
• Each peak in the ECG is identified with a
letter from P to T that corresponds to a
specific electrical activity of the heart.
• The P-wave represents the electrical
excitation (or depolarisation) of the atria,
which leads to the contraction of both
the atria.
• The QRS complex represents the
depolarisation of the ventricles, which
initiates the ventricular contraction.
• The contraction starts shortly after Q and
marks the beginning of the systole.
• The T-wave represents the
return of the ventricles from
excited to normal state
(repolarization). The end of the
T-wave marks the end of
systole.
• Obviously, by counting the
number of QRS complexes that
occur in a given time period,
one can determine the heart
beat rate of an individual.
Regulation of Cardiac Activity
• Normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated by
specialized muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic.
• A special neural center in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac
function through autonomic nervous system (ANs).
• Neural signals through the sympathetic nerves (part of ANS) can increase the
rate of heart beat, the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the
cardiac output.
• On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component of ANS)
decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action potential and
thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones can also increase the
cardiac output.
Disorders of Circulatory System
• High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)- 140/90
• High blood pressure leads to heart diseases and also affects
vital organs like brain and kidney.
• Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)/ atherosclerosis
• deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues, which
makes the lumen of arteries narrower.
• Angina
• It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain
appears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle.
• Heart Failure
• state of heart when it is not pumping blood effectively
enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes
called congestive heart failure because congestion of
the lungs is one of the main symptoms of this disease.
• cardiac arrest
• (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when
the heart muscle is suddenly damaged by an
inadequate blood supply).

Human Blood
• Blood is a fluid connective tissue
• Blood is a part of extracellular (blood flows outside the cells) fluid
within the cardiovascular system. The role of blood in internal
environmental = Homeostatis (blood balances the body)

 Male is 40-50%,
 Female is 37-48%
 New born is 55%.
Plasma
• Plasma is a straw coloured, (pale yellow) viscous fluid constituting
nearly 55 per cent of the blood.
• 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8 per
cent of it.
• Fibrinogen, globulins and albumins are the major proteins.
• Fibrinogens are needed for clotting or coagulation of blood.
• Globulins primarily are involved in defense mechanisms of the body
• Albumins help in osmotic balance.
• Most of albumin and globulin, made from liver.
Plasma
• Plasma also contains small amounts of minerals like Na+, Ca++, Mg++,
HCO3-, Cl-, etc. Glucose, amino acids, lipids, etc., are also present in the
plasma as they are always in transit in the body.
• Factors for coagulation or clotting of blood are also present in the plasma
in an inactive form.
• Plasma without the clotting factors/Fibrinogen is called serum.
• Function of plasma protein:
 Transportation, Forms colloid osmotic pressure (albumin), Coagulation
and anticoagulation.
 Provides buffer action. Globulin protein provides immunity.
Blood Cells
• The forming processes of erythrocytes (red blood cell, RBC),
leukocytes (white blood cell, WBC) and thrombocytes (platelets)
originating from hematopoietic stem cells.
• Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood and the
bone marrow, are called hemopoiesis.
• During young age, yellow marrow makes RBC. During adulthood
(after 18), red marrow makes RBCs.
Red Blood Cells (RBC)
• Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are
the most abundant of all the cells in blood.

camel and lama
• Biconcave in shape.
• RBCs have an average life span of 120 days
• Destroyed in the spleen and liver (graveyard of RBCs).
• Spleen acts as blood bank in case of haemorrhagic shock.
Red Blood Cells (RBC)
• They have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called
haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these cells. (12-16 gm)
• Protein within RBC is hemoglobin (Hb).
 Hb in male adult, 120~160 g/L;
 Hb in female adult, 110~150 g/L;
 Hb in newborn (within 5 days), ≥ 200 g/L
• Haem – Iron/ Ferric form – Red in colour
• Globin – Protein – combine O2 and CO2
• Iron compound- Hematin
Red Blood Cells (RBC)
• CO has 200 times capacity to bind with Hb as compared to O2
Red Blood Cells (RBC)
• Function: Transport of O2 and CO2
• Deficiency : Anaemia
• Hemopoietic material for Erythropoiesis:
 iron (Fe++) and protein, [reason for anemia]
 Influencing factors of RBC maturity: Vitamin B12/ cyanocobalamine
and folic acid/ vit B9 ,
• When go high up , RBC increases because high pressure and less o2
in the blood so to compensate O2, RBCs increases.
• More RBCs in state called Polycythemia
White Blood Cells (WBC)
• Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are
colorless due to the lack of haemoglobin.
• Nucleated/ DNA present.
• Average number (5-9 thousand) mm3 of blood.
• Life span of leukocytes: 1-2 days
• Formation : Bone Marrow

provide Immunity to the body.
White Blood Cells (WBC)
• RBCs : WBCs = 600: 1
• In AIDS WBCs decreases
• Leucopenia : Deficiency of WBCs
• Blood Leukemia : Abnormal increase
in WBCs i.e. Blood Cancer
• Neutrophils, eosinophil and
basophils are different types of
granulocytes/ has granules (small
particles) released during
infections, while lymphocytes and
monocytes are the agranulocytes.
Neutrophils
• Most abundant cells (60-65 per cent)
• Function: It plays a very important role in nonspecific cellular immunity system
which is against pathogenic microorganism, such as bacteria, virus, parasite, etc.
• Number of neutrophil greatly increases, occurring in acute inflammation and
earlier time of chronic inflammation.
• Decrease number of neutrophil will result in poor resistibility and easily
suffering from infection.
• Neutrophils increase during bacterial infections.
Eosinophils
• Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also associated
with allergic reactions.
• Function:
 1. It limits and modulates the effects of basophil on fast allergic
reaction.
 2. It is involved in immune reaction against worm.
• Its number increase when person suffers from parasite infection or
allergic reaction.
Basophil
• It contains heparin, histamine, chemotactic factors and chronic
reactive material for allergic reaction.
• Functions:
 It is also involved in allergic reaction.
 Histamine increase permeability of capillary and contract bronchia
smooth muscle, and result in allergic reaction such as measles,
asthama.
• Basophils secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are
involved in inflammatory reactions. Increase in chickenpox.
• Basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent)
Monocyte
• Its body is large, diameter about 15~30 μm without granule.
• Function:
 It contains many nonspecific lipase and displays the powerful
phagocytosis.
• Monocytes largest of all is called Policeman of blood and increase
during TB.
 Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic cells
which destroy foreign organisms entering the body.
Lymphocytes
• Classification: It can be separated into T- Lymphocyte and BLymphocyte.
• Function: Lymphocytes serve as a nuclear role in immune
responsive reaction.
• Clinic relation: Numbers increase of lymphocytes occur in chronic
inflammation and late time of infection.
• Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of two major types - ‘B’ and ‘T’
forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are responsible for immune
responses of the body.
Lymphocytes
• T-lymphocytes involved in
cellular immunity.
• Cellular immunity is a protective
immune process that involves
the activation of phagocytes,
antigen-sensitized cytotoxic T
cells and the release of cytokines
and chemokines in response to
antigen.
Lymphocytes
• B-Lymphocytes involved in humoral immunity – produce
antibodies.
• Humoral immunity or humoral immunity is the aspect of immunity
that is mediated by macromolecules found in extracellular fluids
such as secreted antibodies, complement proteins, and certain
antimicrobial peptides.
• Humoral immunity is so named because it involves substances
found in the humors, or body fluids.
Platelet or Thrombocytes Physiology
• Platelets/ thrombocytes
• Produced from megakaryocytes
(special cells in the bone marrow).
• Enucleated
• Formation - Bone Marrow
• Died in spleen
• Life span: averagely, 3-5 days in the
blood.
Platelet or Thrombocytes Physiology
• Blood normally contains 1,500,00-4,500,00 platelets mm-3.
• Function: coagulation or clotting of blood, Controlling the
body temp.
• It maintains capillary endothelial cells smooth and integrated
(repairing endothelium and providing nutrition).
• In Dengue platelets decrease.
Coagulation of Blood
Blood Clotting Factors
• Coagulation is the process by
which blood changes from a
liquid to a gel, forming a clot.
• It potentially results in
homeostatis, the cessation of
blood loss from a damaged
vessel, followed by repair.
General mechanism of blood clotting
• Clotting takes place in three essential steps:
1. When there is a trauma to the blood vessel, prothrombin
activator is formed - vessel trauma complex cascade of
chemical reactions takes place in the blood (dozen of
coagulation factors) lead to the formation of a complex of
activated substances collectively called prothrombin activator
2. Prothrombin activator catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin
into thrombin
General mechanism of blood clotting
General mechanism of blood clotting
3. Thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin fibers that enmesh
platelets, RBCs and plasma to form the clot.
• Serum : light yellow fluid after blood coagulation.
• Anti clotting factors : Heparin(in blood), calcium oxalate
(responsible for stone formation), Hirudin (found in leech)
Clotting Factors
• They are the proteins in the blood that control bleeding. When a
blood vessel is injured, the walls of the blood vessel contract to
limit the flow of blood to the damaged area. There main function is
to activate the prothrombin activators. There are total 13 clotting
factors:-
1. Factor I - fibrinogen
2. Factor II - prothrombin
3. Factor III - tissue thromboplastin (tissue factor)
4. Factor IV - ionized calcium ( Ca++ )
Clotting Factors
5. Factor V - labile factor or proaccelerin
6. Factor VI - unassigned
7. Factor VII - stable factor or proconvertin
8. Factor VIII - antihemophilic factor (deficiency causes Haemophillia
A)
9. Factor IX - plasma thromboplastin component, Christmas factor
(deficiency causes Haemophillia B)
10. Factor X - Stuart-Prower factor
Clotting Factors
11. Factor XI - plasma thromboplastin antecedent
12. Factor XII - Hageman factor
13. Factor XIII - fibrin-stabilizing factor
• If any of the clotting factors is missing or is not working properly,
the coagulation cascade is blocked. When this happens, the blood
clot does not form and the bleeding continues longer than it
should.
Clotting Factors
• 2 protein : Fibrinogen, Prothrombin
• Vit- Vit K
• Mineral- Calcium
• clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads called fibrins in
which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped.
• Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in the
plasma by the enzyme thrombin.
• Thrombins, in turn are formed from another inactive substance present
in the plasma called prothrombin.
• An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction.
Lymph (Tissue Fluid)
• As the blood passes through the capillaries in
tissues, some water along with many small
water soluble substances move out into the
spaces. This fluid released out is called the
interstitial fluid or tissue fluid.
• Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the
blood and the cells always occur through this
fluid.
• Flows in one direction from tissues towards
heart.
• Acts as middleman between blood and tissue.
Lymph (Tissue Fluid)
• Lymph is a colourless fluid containing specialized lymphocytes
which are responsible for the immune responses of the body.
Lymph is also an important carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc.
• Fats are absorbed through lymph in the lacteals present in the
intestinal villi.
• Spleen produces lymph and at the same time it is known as
graveyard of lymph.
Blood Groups
• Discovered by Landsteiner
• Two surface antigens (chemicals that can induce immune
response) on the RBCs namely A and B.
• Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural
antibodies a and b (proteins produced in response to antigens).
ABO Blood Group System
Inheritance of ABO Blood Group
• Genotype (present in genes, blood group may be dominant and
recessive) and Phenotype (physically appeared):
Question
• What is the blood group of offspring. If the parents have blood group A
and B ?
Solution:
a) A Blood Group
b) B Blood Group
• Genotype:
 AA, AO, BB, BO
• OFFSPRING GENOTYPE:
 AB, OO, AO, BO
• So, the offspring can have the possibility of A, B, O and AB blood group.

Rh grouping
• Another antigen, the Rh antigen similar to one present in Rhesus
monkeys (hence Rh), is also observed on the surface of RBCs of
majority (nearly 80 per cent) of humans.
• Such individuals are called Rh positive (Rh+ve) and those in whom
this antigen is absent are called Rh negative (Rh-ve).
• Blood used in transfusions much match donors for Rh status as well
as for ABO blood group, as Rh- patients will develop anemia if given
Rh+ blood.
• Discovered by Landsteiner and wiener
Rh disease (Erythroblastosis Fetalis)
• Every person has a blood type, (O, A, B, or AB) and an Rh factor,
either positive or negative. The blood type and the Rh factor simply
mean that a person's blood has certain specific characteristics.
• The blood type is found as proteins on red blood cells and in body
fluids. The Rh factor is a protein that is found on the covering of the
red blood cells.
• If the Rh factor protein is present on the cells, the person is Rh
positive. If there is no Rh factor protein, the person is Rh negative.
Rh disease (Erythroblastosis Fetalis)
• Rh factors are genetically determined. A baby may have the blood type
and Rh factor of either parent, or a combination of both parents. Rh
factors follow a common pattern of genetic inheritance. The Rh positive
gene is dominant (stronger) and even when paired with an Rh negative
gene, the positive gene takes over. For example:
 If a person has the genes + +, the Rh factor in the blood will be
positive.
 If a person has the genes + -, the Rh factor will be positive.
 If a person has the genes - -, the Rh factor will be negative.
Rh disease (Erythroblastosis Fetalis)
• When an Rh negative mother has a baby that is Rh positive,
problems can develop if the baby's red blood cells cross to the Rh
negative mother. This usually happens at delivery when the
placenta detaches.
• It may also happen, however, anytime blood cells of the two
circulations mix such as during a miscarriage or abortion, with a fall,
or during an invasive prenatal testing procedure such as an
amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
Rh disease (Erythroblastosis Fetalis)
• The mother's immune system sees the baby's Rh positive red blood
cells as foreign.
• Just as when bacteria invade the body, the immune system
responds by developing antibodies to fight and destroy these
foreign cells.
• The mother's immune system keeps the antibodies in case the
foreign cells appear again, even in a future pregnancy. The mother
is now Rh sensitized.
Blood Transfusion technique by James Blundell
• Circulatory system is essentially a closed container including a
volume of blood equal to approximately 5 litres.
• Principle of transfusion:
 Identification of blood group must be taken before transfusion.
 Cross-match test must be done before transfusion.
 The same types of blood group for transfusion should be firstly
considered.
 O- Negative is universal donor. AB+ Positive is universal recipient.

Nervous System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Nervous system
• The nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its
actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its
body.
• The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the
body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond
to such events.
• Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600
million years ago.
Nervous system
• In vertebrates it consists of three main parts, the central
nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system
(PNS).
• The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord.
• The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed
bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to
every other part of the body. (Cranial and Spinal Nerves)
Functions of nervous system
• Sensory input – Gathering information, to monitor changes
occurring inside and outside the body.
• Integration – To process and interpret sensory input and decide if
action is needed.
• Motor output
 A response to stimuli.
 Activates muscles or glands
Neuron
• Neuron= nerve cells, (they have minimum power of regeneration
and also the longest cell in the body)
• Cells specialized to transmit electrochemical messages through
neuron by neuron with the empty space called synapse.
• Major regions of neurons
• Cell body – Nucleus and metabolic centre of the cell.
• Processes - Fibres that extend from the cell body.
Neuron
Nerves
• Nerves are thread-like structures and these emerge from the brain
and spinal cord responsible for carrying messages to all the parts of
the body. There are three types of nerves.
1. Sensory nerves send messages from all the senses to the brain.
2. Motor nerves carry messages from the brain to all the muscles.
3. Mixed nerves carry both sensory and motor nerves.
Nerves
• Cranial nerves begin from the brain as these nerves carry impulses
to start from the central nervous system. Certain cranial nerves
belong to the group of mixed nerves while certain ones fall under
sensory nerves.
• Spinal nerves originate from the spinal cord. All the spinal nerves
carry impulses to and from the central nervous system and these
are part of mixed nerves.
SENSORY RECEPTORS
• Sensory receptors are classified according to the type of energy
they can detect and respond to.
• Mechanoreceptors: hearing and balance, stretching.
• Photoreceptors: light.
• Chemoreceptors: smell and taste mainly, as well as internal sensors
in the digestive and circulatory systems.
• Thermoreceptors: changes in temperature.
• Electroreceptors: detect electrical currents in the surrounding
environment.
SENSORY RECEPTORS
• Mechanoreceptors vary greatly in the specific type of stimulus and
duration of stimulus/action potentials.
• The most adaptable vertebrate mechanoreceptor is the hair cell.
• In humans and mammals hair cells are involved with detection of
sound and gravity and providing balance.
Parts
• The nervous system is divided
functionally and structurally
into 2 parts:-
 Central nervous systemThe brain and the spinal
cord.
 Peripheral nervous
system- The cranial nerves
and spinal nerves.
The Peripheral Nervous System
• Sensory (afferent) division – Nerve fibers that carry information to
the central nervous system.
• Motor (efferent) division – Nerve fibers that carry impulses away
from the central nervous system.
• The peripheral nervous system is further classified into two
functional divisions:
 The somatic nervous system- Voluntary, controls the skeletal muscles
 The automatic nervous system- Involuntary, controls the visceral
organs
Organization of the Nervous System
Central Nervous System
• Composed of the brain and spinal cord.
• The brain consists of the gross structures: cerebrum, cerebellum,
brainstem and the diencephalon.
 Diencephalon- Thalamus , hypothalamus and pineal body
 Brainstem- Pons, Medulla and Midbrain
• The spinal cord is made up of nervous tissue, which extends from
the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region of the
vertebral column.
Brain
• Brain is covered by a
membrane called
meninges which protect
the body from external
injury.
• It is situated in a bony
box called Cranium which
protect it from external
injury.
Cerebrum
• This is the largest part of the brain, consist
of right and left hemisphere connected by
the corpus callosum.
• Each cerebral hemisphere is composed of
different lobes- frontal, temporal, parietal
and occipital
• The frontal lobe of the cerebrum
 Influences the personality of the person
 Also responsible for judgment, abstract
reasoning, social behavior, language
expression and motor movement.
Cerebrum
• The temporal lobe of cerebrum
 This part of the cerebrum controls the hearing,
language comprehension, storage and recall of
memories.
 The LIMBIC system is deeply located in the
temporal lobe. This controls the basic drives
such as hunger, anger, emotion and sexual drive.
• The parietal lobe of cerebrum
 This part interprets and integrates the sensory
inputs like touch, temperature and pain.
 It interprets size, shape, distance and texture.
Cerebrum
• The occipital lobe of the
cerebrum
 This functions mainly to
interpret visual stimuli.
• Speech areas in the cerebrum
 Wernicke’s area- Responsible for
the sensory reception of speech.
 Broca’s area- Responsible for the
motor speech.
Cerebrum
• The outer layer of the cerebrum is called
the cortex (also known as “gray
matter”). Information collected by the five
senses comes into the brain from the spinal
cord to the cortex. This information is then
directed to other parts of the nervous system
for further processing.
• In the inner part of the forebrain sits the
thalamus, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland.
• If cerebrum is removed, the person will
become a simple reflex animal.
Cerebrum
• The thalamus carries messages from the sensory organs like the
eyes, ears, nose, and fingers to the cortex. Centre of pain, cold and
heat.
• The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland, which makes the
hormones that control our growth, metabolism, digestion, sexual
maturity, and response to stress.
• It also controls the hunger, pulse, thirst, appetite, sleep patterns,
love, hate, joy and other processes in our bodies that happen
automatically.
• The Midbrain
 The midbrain, located underneath the
middle of the forebrain, acts as a master
coordinator for all the messages going in
and out of the brain to the spinal cord.
 Centre of hearing and vision.
• The Hindbrain
 The hindbrain sits underneath the back
end of the cerebrum, and it consists of the
cerebellum, pons, and medulla.
Cerebellum
• The second largest brain region
• Has also two hemispheres
• The cerebellum — also called the “little
brain” because it looks like a small version
of the cerebrum — is responsible for
balance, movement, and coordination.
• Functions to coordinate muscle movement,
posture and control balance/equilibrium.
• It maintains the posture of the body.
• Alcohal affects the cerebellum most.
The BRAINSTEM
• It connects brain to spinal cord. It is composed of the
midbrain, the pons and the medulla oblongata.
• Functions: House the center for respiration and
cardiovascular system.
• The PONS:-Connects the cerebellum with the cerebrum,
relaying sensory information between the cerebrum and
cerebellum.
 The most inferior portion of the brainstem.
 Serves as the center for autonomic reflexes to
maintain homeostasis, regulating respiratory
vasomotor and cardiac functions.
Medulla Oblongata
• It controls:-
 Respiration
 Sneezing
 Coughing
 Vomiting
Diencephalon
• The thalamus and the
hypothalamus.
• The thalamus is the relay station of
all sensory stimuli towards the brain.
• The hypothalamus controls body
temperature, appetite, balance,
pituitary secretions and sleep-wake
cycle.
SPINAL CORD
• The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular structure made up of
nervous tissue, which extends from the medulla oblongata in
the brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column
(from the foramen magnum)
• It encloses the central canal of the spinal cord, which
contains cerebrospinal fluid (acts as shock absorber)
• The spinal cord carries out two main functions: It connects a
large part of the peripheral nervous system to the brain.
• Information (nerve impulses) reaching the spinal cord
through sensory neurons are transmitted up into the brain.
SPINAL CORD
• There are 31 pairs of spinal
nerves that exit the spinal cord.
 Cervical – 8 pairs
 Thoracic – 12 pairs
 Lumbar – 5 pairs
 Sacral – 5 pairs
 Caudal or Coccygeal – 1 pair
Reflex Actions
Reflex Actions
• A reflex arc is a neural pathway that controls a reflex.
• In vertebrates, most sensory neurons do not pass directly into the
brain, but synapse in the spinal cord. This allows for faster reflex
actions to occur by activating spinal motor neurons without the
delay of routing signals through the brain. However, the brain will
receive the sensory input while the reflex is being carried out and
the analysis of the signal takes place after the reflex action.
• Spinal cord works as centre of relex action.
• Reflex action was ist discovered by Scientist Marshall Hall.
Peripheral Nervous System
• Made up of nerves arising from brain and spinal cord.
• These are called Cranial nerves and Spinal Nerves.
CRANIAL NERVES
• Are 12 pairs of nerves that exit the brain, are 12 pairs.
• It can be classified as :
 Sensory
 Motor
 Mixed(sensory and motor)

Spinal nerves
• 31 pairs of spinal nerves
Autonomic Nervous System
• The part of the peripheral
nervous system that enervates
cardiac muscles, smooth
muscles and glands.
• Functionally divided into
 Sympathetic nervous
system
 Parasympathetic nervous
system
Sympathetic system
• Utilized by the body for flight and fight response.
• Neurotransmitter agents are Epinephrine and Norepinephrine
(coming from the adrenal gland)
• Adrenergic system- ADRENALINE
Sympathetic responses
• Increased
 Heart rate
 Blood sugar
 Blood pressure
 Visual acuity (Pupillary dilation(broadening of the people))
 Smooth muscle tone --- sphincture are contracted
 Metabolism--- increase glucose and increase in fatty acids
Sympathetic responses
• Decreased
• Peristalsis (Peristalsis is a series of wave-like muscle contractions
that moves food to different processing stations in the digestive
tract. The process of peristalsis begins in the esophagus when a
bolus of food is swallowed)
• Salivary secretions
Parasympathetic System
• CHOLINERGIC system: The cholinergic system is composed of
organized nerve cells that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in
the transduction of action potentials.
• These nerve cells are activated by or contain and release
acetylcholine during the propagation of a nerve impulse. The
cholinergic system has been associated with a number of cognitive
functions, including memory, selective attention, and emotional
processing.
• Neurotransmitter is Acetylcholine.
Parasympathetic System
• Increased
 Gastric secretions
 Salivary secretions
 Peristalsis
• Decreased
 Pupillary constriction (constriction response (miosis), is
the narrowing of the pupil).

Conditional Reflex
• First shown by
Pavlov on dog Laika.
• It is controlled by
Cerebrum
• The nature of nerve
impulse is
Electrochemical.

LAWS in CHEMISTRY
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Chemical Laws
The laws of nature related to chemistry is known as chemical
laws.
Chemical reactions, normally, are administrated by certain laws,
which are observed and formulated in words become
fundamental concepts in chemistry.
Significant Chemical Laws
Laws Explanation
Avogadro's Law
“Equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and
pressure, have the same number of molecules”.
Avogadro’s number : 6.023 x 10 23 molecules
Planck’s quantum theory of
Radiation
According to this, radiant energy is emitted or absorbed in the
form of small energy packets called quanta. In case of light
these energy packets are known as photons. The energy of
each quantum is directly proportional to frequency of
radiation. Planck’s constant = 6.626 x 10-34 Js
Boyle's Law
“The absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas
is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the
temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged (constant)
within a closed system”
Significant Chemical Laws
Laws Explanation
Charles' Law (also known
as Law of Volume)
“When the pressure on a sample of a dry gas is held
constant, the Kelvin temperature and the volume will
be directly related”
Ideal gas equation PV = nRT (n is number of mole) and R is gas constant
(1.987 cal K-1 mol-1)
Gay-Lussac's Law
"At constant volume, the pressure of given mass of a
gas is directly proportional to the temperature in
Kelvin.
Significant Chemical Laws
Laws Explanation
Law of conservation of
energy
“Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed”
Heisenberg’s
Uncertainty principle
Exact position and momentum cannot be determined
simultaneously.
Faraday's Law
Electrolysis
“The amount of substance produced at an electrode is
directly proportional to the quantity of electricity
passed”
Significant Chemical Laws
Laws Explanation
Atomic Theory “Matter is composed of distinct units known as atoms”
de-Broglie’s equation
Dual nature of electron i.e. all matter has both particle and
wave nature.
λ = h/mv, where λ is wavelength, h is Planck's constant, m is
the mass of a particle, moving at a velocity v. de
Broglie suggested that particles can exhibit properties of
waves
Pauli’s Exclusion principle All the four quantum numbers for any two electrons in an
atom cannot be identical.
Hund’s Rule The filling of electrons in orbitals first take place singly after
than pairing of electrons takes place.
Significant Chemical Laws
Laws Explanation
Graham’s Law of diffusion
It states that the rate of the effusion of a gas is inversely
proportional to the square root of its density or
molecular mass under similar conditions of temperature
and pressure.
Kinetic Theory of Gases
“Describes the behavior of a hypothetical ideal gas”.
The average kinetic energy of a collection of gas particles
is directly proportional to absolute temperature only.
Aufbau Principle
“Explains that the electrons orbiting the atoms first fill
the lowest energy levels and then second higher levels
and so on and so forth”
Significant Chemical Laws
Laws Explanation
Dalton’s law of
partial pressure
It states that in a mixture of non-reacting
gases, the total pressure exerted is equal to
the sum of the partial pressures of the
individual gases.
Ideal and Real Gases
• Gases which follow gas laws at all conditions of temperature
and pressure are called Ideal Gases.
• Real gases follow gas law only at high temperature and low
pressure.

MEDICINES
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Drugs and Medicines
• Drug, also called medicine, is a chemical substance used to cure,
prevent, or diagnose a disease
Chemotherapy
• Use of chemical substances for the treatment of a disease is termed
as chemotherapy.
Some Important Classes of Drugs
• Tranquilizers are the chemicals used to relieve stress, mental
tension, anxiety. These form a major component of the sleeping
pills.

• Analgesics: These are the drugs used to reduce or abolish pain
without causing the loss of consciousness, paralysis and some other
disturbances.
• For example- Asprin, Analgin, Paracitamol.
Analgesics
• Analgesics are of two types:
 (i) Narcotics: These drugs relieve pain but also produce sleep or
drowsiness.
 These are habit forming drugs and are also termed as addictive
drugs. For example: Morphine, codeine, heroin.
 (ii) Non-narcotics: These are non-habit forming drugs also
named as non-addictive drugs.

Some Important Classes of Drugs
• Antacid: The chemical substances which neutralize the excess acid in
stomach and give relief from acidity are called antacids. For example:
Sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3
), magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2
]
and aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3

• In cheese, baked foods, pickles and meat sorbic acid and its salts
are used as preservatives.
• Epoxides and ethyl formates are used for the preservation of
species nuts and dried fruits.
• Artificial Sweetness: These do not impart any calories to the body. Since these
substances are excreted through urine. For example,
• Saccharin : A sweetish crystalline solid which is 550 times sweeter than sugar,
but does not have any food value. It is used by diabetic patients. It is the first
discovered artificial sweetner.

Chemistry of Cleansing Agents
in Everyday Life
What are Soaps and Detergents?
• Soaps are sodium or potassium salt of higher carboxylic acid such as
stearic acid, Palmitic acid and oleic acid whereas detergents contain
a long chain of alkyl groups. Detergents in comparison to soaps can
also function in hard water.
• Saponification: Alkaline hydrolysis of triesters of glycerol to form
soap is known as saponification. Soaps do not function in hard
water since they precipitate in it.
How do soaps work?
• Soaps are generally sodium or potassium salts of long chain fatty
acids. Soap molecules have a hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic
part.
• While the hydrophilic part clings to the water when washing, the
hydrophobic end clings to the dirt particles.
• Thus when we pour away the water, the dirt particles wash away
with the soap molecules.
Types of Soaps
• Toilet Soaps: Potassium soaps are softer than sodium soaps.
• Floating Soaps: These can be prepared by beating soap bubbles.
• Transparent Soaps: These contains soap dissolved in excess of
alcohol and it is evaporated.
• Medicated Soaps: These contain soaps by adding little amounts of
Dettol, Savlon etc.
• Laundry Soaps mainly contains Sodium rosinate, borax.
Types of Detergents
• Anionic Detergent: In this, anion acts as detergents. For
example, Sodium Lauryl Sulphate
• Cationic Detergents: In this type, cation
acts as a detergent. For example,
Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
• Non-Ionic Detergents: These are neutral. The whole molecule acts
as a detergent. For example, Polyethylene glycol stearate.
Chemistry of Cosmetics in Everyday life
Cosmetics contains the following categories of chemicals.
• Emulsifier: These increase the stability of the emulsion.
 For example, Potassium cetyl sulfate.
• Preservatives: These are added to cosmetics to increase their shelf
life.
 For example, benzyl alcohol, salicylic acid.
Chemistry of Cosmetics in Everyday life
• Thickeners: These given an appealing consistency. For example,
Cetyl alcohol, Stearic acid.
• Emollient: These soften the skin by preventing water loss. For
example, Glycerine, zinc oxide.
• Glimmer and Shiners: For example, mica, bismuth oxychloride.
Other Examples of Chemistry in Everyday Life
The Expiration Date on Bottled Drinking Water:
• The idea behind instilling an expiration on bottled drinking
water is to standardize the packaging quality of it.
• What the actual expiration date signifies is if the expiration
date is up, the taste of the water will be different as there is a
chance of the chemicals in the packaging material ruining the
quality of water.
Other Examples of Chemistry in Everyday Life
Elements in the Human Body:
• We all know our body is about 60% water.
• Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen compose 96% of the
human body.
• Whereas the rest 4% is composed of about 60 elements.
• Some of these elements include calcium, phosphorus, potassium,
and sulfur.
Elements in the Human Body
Other Examples of Chemistry in Everyday Life
Sunblock and Sunscreen:
• There are two kinds of rays from the sun which are particularly bad
for us, UV-A & UV-B.
• Sunscreens action is as the named suggest, it functions as a screen
and offers protection from sunburns which is caused by UV-B.
• Whereas sunblock has more of reflective nature and blocks both

Endocrine
System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
• The endocrine system consists of glands that perform very different
functions. They are related to each other because they all secrete
hormones into the blood.
• Organs and glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to
regulate various body functions.

TYPES OF GLANDS
• Exocrine glands
 Release secretions into duct that carries them to outside of
body. Ex: Sweat glands
• Endocrine glands
 Release hormones directly into bloodstream.
 Have no ducts, referred to as ductless glands
 Example: Thyroid gland
. Mixed glands
 Both endocrine ad exocrine functions. Example : Pancreas
ADRENAL GLANDS
• Two glands, one located
above each kidney.
• Each gland is composed of
two sections :-
1. Adrenal cortex
2. Adrenal medulla
• Adrenal Gland is also called
4S gland i.e. Sugar
Metabolism, Salt retention,
Sex Hormone, Source of
Energy.
Adrenal cortex
• Mineralocorticoid
 Example: Aldosterone
 Regulates sodium and potassium levels.
• Glucocorticoid
 Example: Cortisol
 Regulates Carbohydrates, protein and fats metbolism
• Steroid sex hormones
 Androgens, estrogens and progesterone
 Regulate secondary sexual characteristics
Adrenal medulla
• Present in Inner portion of adrenal.
• Secretes Epinephrine and nor-epinephrine.
• Epinephrine is also called adrenaline. (emergency hormone / 3F
Hormone Fear, Fight and Flight )
• Critical during emergency situations
 Increases blood pressure
 Increases heart rate
 Increases respiration rate
Ovary
• There are two ovaries in a female.
It is located in pelvic cavity of
females. It secretes female sex
hormones,
1. Estrogen
2. Progesterone
• Estrogen is responsible for:-
 Female sexual characteristics
(secondary sexual characters)
 Regulation of menstrual cycle
Ovary
• Progesterone Hormone
 It maintains suitable uterine environment for pregnancy.
 It stimulates the thickening of uterus lining and causes
development of breasts in the later month of pregnancy.
• Relaxin Hormone
 Found in uterus and placenta and widens the uterine cervix so
that a child delivery can take place easily.
Testes
• Two oval glands located in scrotum.
• Leydig cells Secrete male sex hormone, testosterone (produces sperms
and secondary sexual characters to male)
Pancreas
• It is located along curvature of
stomach, only organ that has both
endocrine and exocrine functions.
• Its exocrine portion, releases
digestive enzymes through duct
into duodenum and endocrine
sections of the pancreas contains
islets of langerhans which
produces insulin and glucagon.
Pancreas
• Insulin
 It is produced by beta cells and stimulates cells of body to take
in glucose from bloodstream. It lowers the blood sugar level and
occurs when the body needs less glucose.
• Glucagon
 It is produced by alpha cells and stimulates liver to release
stored glucose into bloodsream. It raises blood sugar levels and
occurs when body needs more glucose
THYROID GLAND
• It is located on either side of trachea
and resembles a butterfly in shape. It is
divided into right and left lobes.
• It controls Basal Metabolic Rate (
minimum energy requirement for
maintenance of body during rest or
sleep)
• For normal human adult it is 1600
kcal/day.
• It produces thyroid hormones:
1. Thyroxine (T4)
2. Triiodothyronine(T3)
THYROID GLAND
• It needs iodine to make hormones. These hormones :
1. Regulate energy production
2. Adjust metabolic rate
• It also secretes calcitonin, regulates level of calcium in bloodstream.
• If calcium levels in blood rise too high:
1. Calcitonin levels in blood increase.
2. Increases deposition of calcium into bone.
3. Lowers levels of calcium in bloodstream.
• Its action is opposite of parathyroid hormone.
PARATHYROID GLANDS
• It is made by four tiny
glands, located on dorsal
surface of thyroid gland.
• It secretes parathyroid
hormone (PTH), which
regulates level of calcium
in bloodstream.
PARATHYROID GLANDS
Hormones released are:
1. Parathyroid Hormone: It is also called Collip’s Hormone.
• If calcium levels in blood fall too low:
 Parathyroid hormone levels in the blood increases.
 Stimulate bone breakdown.
 Regulates more calcium into the blood stream.
• Removal of the gland leads to death due to tetany. (cramps, tremors)
2. Parathyroid hormone works in partnership with calcitonin from the
thyroid gland. The 2 hormones have the opposite effect.
ENDOCRINE GLANDS OF THE BRAIN
• Pineal gland
 The pineal gland is a part of the
thalamus region of the brain.
 It secretes melatonin. It plays a
role in regulating body’s circadian
rhythm-24 hour clock that
governs periods of wakefulness
and sleepiness.
• Pituitary gland
 Smallest and Master gland
 Controlled by Hypothalamus
(thermostat)
ENDOCRINE GLANDS OF THE BRAIN
• Anterior pituitary: It referred to as ‘Master gland’, secretes
hormones that regulate other endocrine glands.
 Thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) regulates function of
thyroid gland.
 Adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) regulates function of
adrenal cortex.
 Follicle stimulating hormones (FSH)- It is responsible for
development of ova and sperm and also stimulates ovary to
secrete estrogen.
ENDOCRINE GLANDS OF THE BRAIN
 LH (luteinizing hormones)- It stimulates secretion of sex
hormones and plays a role in releasing ova in females.
 It also secretes growth hormones or somatotropin and
stimulates cells to grow and divide.
 Prolactin (PRL), stimulates milk production in breast.
 Melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), stimulates
melanocytes to produce more melanin.
ENDOCRINE GLANDS OF THE BRAIN
Posterior pituitary
1. Antidiuretic hormones (ADH), also called vasopressin. It promotes
water re-absorption by the kidney tubules.
 Maintains water balance in the body and reduce the volume of urine.
 Hypoactivity leads to Diabetes Inspidus in which patient excrete large
amount of urine.
 Also causes contraction of small arteries causing increase in Blood
Pressure.
2. Oxytocin (OXT), stimulates uterine contractions during labor and
delivery. After birth stimulates release of milk from breast.
Thymus gland
• It is located in mediastinum, part of
immune system and secretes thymosin
hormone.
• It is essential for growth and
development of thymic lymphocytes or T
cells.
• Thymosin hormone is critical part of the
body’s immune system.
• It is present at birth and grows to largest
size during puberty. At puberty begins to
shrink and eventually is replaced with
connective and adipose tissue.
DEFICIENCY DISEASES
Adrenaline hormone
1. Cushing’s syndrome
 The cause of Cushing syndrome is excess cortisol secretion that
doesn't depend on stimulation from ACTH (AdrenoCorticoTropic
Hormone ) and is associated with disorders of the adrenal glands.
2. Addison’s disease
 Addison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency and
hypocortisolism, is a longterm endocrine disorder in which the adrenal
glands do not produce enough steroid hormones.
 Symptoms generally come on slowly and may include abdominal pain,
weakness, and weight loss.
DIABETES MELLITUS
• Insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus
 Also called type 1
 Develops early in life
 Destruction of islet cells
 Person makes too little
insulin. Does not take insulin
• Non- insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus
 Also called type 2
 Develops later in life
 Person makes enough insulin,
but it has lost ability to
regulate cells.
 Must take insulin injections
Treated by diet, exercise, and
oral medications.
PITUITARY GLANDS
• DISEASES CAUSES
1. Acromegaly Chronic hypersection of growth hormone in
adults; causes enlargement of bones of head and extremities.
2. Diabetes insipidus Hyposecretion of antidiuretic hormone;
symptoms include polyuria and polydipsia.
3. Dwarfism Hyposecretion of growth hormone in children;
causes short stature.
PITUITARY GLANDS
4. Gigantism Hypersecretion of growth hormone in child; results
in very tall adult.
5. Panhypopituitarism Hyposecretion of all pituitary hormones;
results in problems with the glands controlled by pituitary
gland.
Thyroid gland
• DISEASES CAUSES
 Exophthalmos Exophthalmos (also called exophthalmus,
exophthalmia, proptosis, or exorbitism) is a bulging of the eye
anteriorly out of the orbit
 Cretinism Congenital hyposecretion of thyroid; results in poor
physical and mental development.
 Goitre Enlarged thyroid gland
Thyroid gland
 Graves’ disease Hypersecretion of thyroid; symptoms include
exophthalmos and goitre
 Hashimoto’s disease: Autoimmune destruction of thyroid;
results in hyposecretion disorder.
 Myxedema Hyposecretion disorder in adult; symptoms include
anemia, edema, and mental lethargy.
 Thyrotoxicosis: Marked hyper secretion; symptoms include
rapid heart rate, tremors and weight loss
Facts
• Tear gland is lacrimal gland.
• Oxytocin is injected into cows and buffaloes during milking.
• Oral pills prevent ovulation in the female body. Progesterone is
present in oral contraceptive pills.

The Vijayanagar Empire (1336-1672)
• By the end of the Sultanate Period, Multan and Bengal were the first
territories to break away from the Delhi and declared independent and
many other territories in the Deccan region rose to power.
Sources
• The sources for the study of Vijayanagar are varied such as literary,
archaeological and numismatics.

• The last ruler of Sangama dynasty was Virupaksha II. He was deposed and
assassinated by his commander-in-chief Saluva Narasimha in 1485 AD who
laid the foundation of Saluva dynasty.
• The Saluva dynasty lasted only two decades and in 1503 AD, Vir narasimha
the commander in chief of the last Saluva ruler Immadi Narsimha usurped
the throne and thus laying the foundation of Tuluva dynasty
Tuluva Dynasty (1505-1570 AD)
The son of Narsa Nayaka, Vira Narsimha was the founder of
Tuluva dynasty. He was succeeded by his brother, Krishnadeva
Raya in 1509 AD.
Krishnadeva Raya
• At the time of Krishnadevaraya’s accession to the throne, the condition of
the empire was unstable, as he had to deal with rebellious subordinates
and aggression of the Gajapathis of Orissa and the Muslim kingdoms in
the north.
• Krishna Deva Raya won the Gajapati kingdom in present day Orissa and
extended the Vijayanagara empire to that region as well.
• Krishna Deva Raya defeated the Deccan Sultans in the battle of Diwani. He
then invaded Raichur Doab(between Tungabhadra and Krishna river,
known for its fertile soil) confronting Sultan of Bijapur, Ismail Adil Shah.
He also captured Bidar.
Krishnadeva Raya

• Caesor Fredrick visited Vijayanagara after the battle of Talikota.
• Vina (musical instrument) acquired a prominent palace in the
Vijayanagar empire.
• The last ruler of Vijayanagar was Sri Ranga III.
Administration under Vijayanagar Empire
• The kingdom was divided into provinces known as Mandalam, headed by
‘mandaleshwar’.
• It was further divided into nadu, sthala and grams.
• Land revenue was fixed at 1/6th of the produce.
• Land revenue varied according to nature of cultivated land. There were
taxes on various professions.
• The Ayagar system: It was an important feature of the village organization
in vijayanagar. According to this, every village was a separate unit and its
affairs were conducted by a team of 12 functionaries who were
collectively known as the ‘ayagars’.
Administration under Vijayanagar Empire
• They were granted tax-free lands (manyams) which they were to enjoy in
perpectuity for their services. Once granted, these ayagars had a
hereditary right over their offices.
• The ayagars could also sell or mortgage their offices.
• For justice, very harsh punishments like mutilation of body, throwing to
elephants were delivered.
• The army under Vijayanagar Kingdom was well organised and efficient.
• It consisted of cavalry, infantry, artillary and elephants. The highest grade
officers in army were known as ‘Nayaks or Poligars‘. They were awarded
land in lieu of their services.
Administration under Vijayanagar Empire
• The Nayakara system: Under this system, the king was considered to be
the owner of the soil and he distributed the lands to his nayakas.
• Nayakas had to pay a fixed annual financial contribution to the imperial
exchequer which, according to the chronicle of Nuniz, was generally half
their revenue.
• They were required to maintain a sufficient number of troops for the
king and serve them in his war.
• The nayaka enjoyed greater freedom in his province. There was no system
of transfer from one district to another.
Society under Vijayanagar empire
• The city of Vijayanagar was a luxurious society with splendid buildings.
• Slavery was prevalent, as mentioned by Nicolo Conti.
• Silk and cotton clothes were mainly used for dresses.
• Vijayanagar markets were noted for dealing in spices, textiles and precious
stones.
• Religious tolerance was shown towards everyone.
• Muslims were also employed in the administration.
• A large number of temples were built during this time.
• Epics and Puranas were popular among masses.
Society under Vijayanagar empire
• Position of Women: – Women were employed in royal palaces.
• Some women scholars like Hannamma, Thirumalamma and
Gangadevi, who wrote Madhuravijayam.
• Subordinate condition of women: Devadasi system was flourishing
under Vijayanagar Kingdom, dancing girls were attached to the
temples.
• Polygamy was prevalent among royal families.
• Sati practice was also recounted by traveller accounts.
Architecture under Vijayanagar Empire
• It is generally understood that the very location
site of Vijayanagara was inspired by the
existence of the shrines of Virupaksha and
Pampadevi.
• This is supported by the fact that,
the Vijayanagara kings claimed to rule on
behalf of the god Virupaksha.
• Vijayanagar rulers began the practice of wall
inscriptions containing stories of Ramayana and
Mahabharata on temples.
• Vithalswamy and Hazara Rama temple has such
inscriptions.
• The chief characteristic feature of Vijayanagar Architecture was
the construction of tall Raya Gopurams(gateways) and kalyan
mandapas(open pavilion) with carved pillars.
• These mandapas were meant for seating deities on festival occasions.
• The Varadhraja and Ekamparanatha temple at Kanchipuram are also
examples of Vijayanagar style of Architecture.
• Mahanayakacharya: He is an officer and the contact point between
the villages and the Central administration
Contribution to Literature

• Sayana wrote commentaries on Vedas.
• Krishnadevaraya wrote Amuktamalyada in Telugu and Usha
Parinayam and Jambavathi Kalyanam in Sanskrit.
Decline of the Empire
• The rulers of the Aravidu dynasty were weak and incompetent.
• Many provincial governors became independent.
• The rulers of Bijapur and Golconda seized some areas of
Vijayanagar.

Sensory Organs:
HUMAN EYE and
EAR
By Dr Vipan Goyal

THE HUMAN EYE
• The human eye is like a camera. Its lens
system forms an image on a lightsensitive screen called the retina.
• Light enters the eye through a thin
membrane called the cornea.
• It forms the transparent bulge on the
front surface of the eyeball.
• The eyeball is approximately spherical in
shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm.
• Most of the refraction for the light
rays entering the eye occurs at the
outer surface of the cornea.
• The crystalline lens merely provides
the finer adjustment of focal length
required to focus objects at
different distances on the retina.
THE HUMAN EYE
• We find a structure called iris behind
the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular
diaphragm that controls the size of the
pupil.
• The pupil regulates and controls the
amount of light entering into the eye.
• The eye lens forms an inverted real
image of the object on the retina.
• The retina is a delicate membrane
having enormous number of lightsensitive cells.
• The light-sensitive cells get activated
upon illumination and generate
electrical signals.
• These signals are sent to the brain via
the optic nerves.
• The brain interprets these signals, and
finally, processes the information so
that we perceive objects as they are.
Layers of the eye
• Sclera: outer white layer;
maintains shape of eye;
muscles attached control
eye movement.
• Choroid: contains blood
vessels.

Focusing Light Rays
• Cornea
• Lens
• Cilliary muscle
Focusing Light Rays
• Light rays from distant
objects enter the eye
parallel to one another.
• Light rays from close
objects diverge.
• Nearby objects Distant
objects
Accommodations
• The eye lens is composed of a
fibrous, jelly-like material.
• Its curvature can be modified to some
extent by the ciliary muscles.
• The change in the curvature of the
eye lens can thus change its focal
length.
• When the muscles are relaxed, the
lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal
length increases. This enables us to
see distant objects clearly.
Accommodations
• When you are looking at objects closer to the
eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This increases
the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens
then becomes thicker.
• Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens
decreases. This enables us to see nearby
objects clearly. The ability of the eye lens to
adjust its focal length is called accommodation.
• However, the focal length of the eye lens
cannot be decreased below a certain minimum
limit
Image production
Retina
• At the back of the eye.
• Consist of 2 types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones.
• Converts light signal into an electrical signal that is transmitted to
the brain through the optic nerve at the back of the eye
• Consist of 2 types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones
• Converts light signal into an electrical signal that is transmitted to
the brain through the optic nerve.
Rods and Cones
• Rod cells: light sensors
 120 million
 Functions in less intense light/ dim light and contain the
pigment Rhodopsin (in nocturnal animal more)
 Used in peripheral vision
 Responsible for night vision
 Detects black, white and shades of grey
Rods and Cones
• cone cells: detects colour
 7 million
 Highest concentration at fovea centralis
 Functions best in bright light
 Perceives fine details
 3 types of cone cells, each sensitive to one of the three primary
additive colours: red, green, and blue.
 Present in diurnal animals.
 Transferred from parents.
Macula Lutea
• Small yellowish area of the retina near the optic disc (“yellow spot”)
• Area that provides the most acute vision (clear vision)
• When the gaze is fixed on any object, the centre of the macula, the
centre of the lens, and the object are in a straight line.
Blind spot
• Optic disc: where the optic nerves converge and exit the eye
• No light-sensitive cells to detect light rays
• Results in a break in the visual field, known as a blind spot.
Producing an image
• The converging lens
produces an inverted
images which the brain
interprets as being
upright.
• Cells on retina trigger a
nerve impulse
• Nerve cells sends an
electrical signal to the
brain via the optic nerve.
Photoreceptors detect vision and light sensitivity
• The human eye can detect light in the 400-700 nanometer (nm)
range, a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, the visible
light spectrum.
• Light with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm is termed ultraviolet
(UV) light.
• Light withwavelengths longer than 700 nmis termed infrared (IR)
light.
Vision Problems
Myopia (near sightedness)
Hyperopia (far sightedness)
Presbyopia
Astigmatism
Myopia (near- sightedness)
Myopia (near- sightedness)
• Inability of the eye to focus light from distant objects
• See close objects clearly
• Image focuses in front of the retina
• Develops in childhood and progressively worsens
• Tends to stabilize in adulthood
• Has a genetic component
• Affects a major part of the population
Myopia (near- sightedness)
• Cause:
 Distance between lens and retina is too long. (long eyeball)
 Cornea & lens converge light too strongly.(strong refractive
power)
• Correction:
 Corrected with a diverging lens/ Concave Lens.
 Negative meniscus: lens shape where edge of lens is thicker
than the middle but modified from a basic diverging lens to
make it more cosmetically appealing.
Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness)
Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness)
• Inability of the eye to focus light from near objects.
• No difficulty seeing distant objects.
• Babies are born slightly hypermetropic.
• As eye grows, condition fixes itself.
• Image focused behind retina.
Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness)
• Cause
 Distance between lens and retina is too small (short eyeball)
 Cornea & lens is too weak (doesn’t diverge rays enough)
 Corrected with converging lens/ Convex lens.
 Positive meniscus: lens shape where middle part of lens is
thicker than the edge but modified from a basic converging lens
to make it more cosmetically appealing.
Presbyopia
Presbyopia
• A form of hypermetropia (far sightedness) that occurs with age.
• Cause: Eye lens losing elasticity
• Not a result of eyeball being too short.
• Correct with bifocal lens. (both converging and diverging).
Astigmatism
Astigmatism
• Astigmatism is a common vision condition that causes blurred
vision.
• It occurs when the cornea (the clear front cover of the eye) is
irregularly shaped or sometimes because of the curvature of the
lens inside the eye.
 Irregular shaped cornea “football”
 Two focus points
• Astigmatism is a vision problem that results from a cornea that has
an irregular shape.
Cataract
• Due to defective
protein metabolism the
lens becomes opaque.
• Operation is needed.
Glaucoma
• Due to defect in aqueous humour.
Xeropthalamia
• It is due to deficiency of
vitamin A. In this conjunctiva
or cornea becomes
keratinized.
• It may lead to blindness.
Important facts
• Space between lens and cornea is filled with a transparent watery
fluid called Aqueous Humour.
• The space behind the lens is filled with Vitreous Humour.
• Color of eye is the color of the iris.
• Cornea is donated in eye donation.
• Eye glow in animals due to tapetum.
• Tear glands is also called Lacrimal Gland. Tear contain Lysozyme
(antibacterial properties)
• Atropine drug is used for pupil dilation.
Hearing
• Hearing involves the actions of the external
ear, eardrum, ossicles, and cochlea.
• In hearing, sound waves in air are converted
into vibrations of a liquid then into movement
of hair cells in the cochlea.
• Finally they are converted into action
potentials in a sensory dendrite connected to
the auditory nerve.
• Very loud sounds can cause violent vibrations
in the membrane under hair cells, causing a
shearing or permanent distortion to the cells,
resulting in permanent hearing loss.
Hearing
Outer Ear
• When you see someone, all you see is a very small
part of a very complex mechanism.
• The flaps of cartilage are known as the Pinna.
• These folds of cartilage help reflect the incoming
sound waves and also affect its intensity. This effect
allows the brain to figure out direction of the source
of the sound.
• The pinna is the opening to the ear Canal.
• The ear canal is a small cylindrical tube about 2.5
centimetres long. This canal leads to a vibrating
membrane commonly known as eardrum.
• The eardrum marks the beginning of middle Ear.
Middle Ear
• The sound waves striking the eardrum create a
vibration in the air filled cavity of the middle
ear.
• The sound waves are in the form of pressure
differences and are transferred from here to
the cochlea in the inner ear by the means of
three of the smallest bones in the Human Body.
• They are called Malleus (Hammer), Incus (Anvil)
and Stapes (Stirrups).
• The sound here is still in wave form. The sound
information is transferred to the Cochlea in the
Inner Ear.
Inner Ear
• Cochlea consists of several fluid-filled sac
like structures.
• The ear structures are covered with tiny
hair and these convert the wave
information into a form that we can
understand.
• It is here that the sound wave is
converted into nerve impulses that is sent
to the brain via the auditory nerve.
• This electrical impulse is perceived by us
that leads to our sense of hearing.

Mughal Empire
Babur (1526-1530)
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Babur (1526-1530)
• Mughals belonged to a branch of the Turks
called Chagatai, which is named after the
second son of Genghis Khan, the famous
Mongol Leader.
• The Foundation of the Mughal Empire in
India was laid by Babur, who was a
Chagatai Turk.
Babur (1526-1530)
• Babur is the founder of the Mughal Empire in India.
• He was a descendant of Timur (on his father’s side) and Genghis Khan (on his
Mother’s side).
• His original name was Zahiruddin Muhammad.
• Babur was born in 1483 at Farghana situated between Persia and Turkestan
i.e. modern Uzbekistan and spent 36 years of his life in that country.
• In 1494 at the age of 11, Babur became the ruler of Farghana (at present in
Chinese Turkistan) succeeding Umar Shaikh Mirza, his father.
Babur (1526-1530)
• In 1501, he tried to win Samarkand and was defeated by Muhammad
Shaybani. Muhammad Shaybani took Herat too in 1507.
• The only lasting success of Babur in his initial career was Kabul and took
thr title Padshah.
• At Kabul, as soon as 1523, the Afghan nobles began to intrigue with him to
dislodge Ibrahim Lodi.
• Daulat Khan, the most powerful noble of Punjab, who was
discontented with Ibrahim Lodhi, invited Babur to invade India.
Babur (1526-1530)
• He undertook four expeditions to India in order to conquer it between the
years 1519 and 1523.
• The first attack of Babur in India was on Bajaur in 1519 with 2000 horsemen.
• It was followed by capture of Bhira on Jhelum River in Punjab. He came by
crossing Khyber Pass.
• 2
nd attack was in 1519 and captured the Peshawar.
• 3
rd attack was in 1520 and captured the Sialkot.
• 4
th attack was in 1524 and captured maximum portion of Punjab.
Babur's Military Conquests
• In 1504, Babur occupied Kabul.
• In 1524, Babur occupied Lahore and turned to Kabul after Daulat
Khan turned against him.
• In November 1525, Babur attacked and occupied Punjab again.
• On 21st April 1526, Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the first Battle of
Panipat and quickly occupied Delhi and Despite of vast and superior troop
Ibrahim Lodi lost in the battle due to Babur’s superior strategy and use of
artillery.
Babur's Military Conquests
• In this Babur used the Rumi (Ottoman) device of lashing a large number of
carts to form a defending wall with guns (Tulghama system of warfare).
• His artillery was led by Ustad Ali and Mustafa.
• The First Battle of Panipat marked the foundation of Mughal dominion in
India.
Babur's Military Conquests
• After wiining the Panipat battle, Babur gave gifts to his Sardars and Kohinoor to his
son Humayun. For this generosity everyone called him Kalandhar.
• Babur conquered Delhi and sent his son Humayun to seize Agra.
• Babur announced himself as “Emperor of Hindustan”.
• Rana Sangha of Mewar was a great Rajput warrior.
• He gave the toughest resistance to Babur’s expansion plans.
• OnMarch 16, 1527, Rana Sangha, along with rulers of Marwar, Amber,
Gwalior, Ajmer and Chanderi and Sultan Mahmood Lodi (whom Rana
Sangha had acknowledged as ruler of Delhi) met Babur in a
decisive contest at Kanhwa, a village near Agra.
• The aim was to prevent the imposition of another foreign repression
on Babur succeeded over them by using similar tactics as in the Battle of
Panipat. The, he took on the title of “Ghazi”.
• In the year 1528, Chanderi was captured by Babur from Rajput king
Medini Rai.
• On May 6, 1529, Babur met the allied Afghans of Bihar and Bengal on the
banks of Gogra, near Patna and defeated them. With this battle, Babur
occupied a considerable portion of northern India.
• Babur met the allied Afghans of Bihar and Bengal under Mahmud Lodhi on
the banks of Gogra, near Patna, and inflicted a crushing defeat on them.
• His victory led to rapid popularization of gunpowder and arteillery in India.
• On December 26, 1530, Babur died at Agra aged 40.
• His body was first laid at Arambagh in Agra, but was later taken to Kabul,
where it was buried.
• During his four-year stay in India, Punjab, territory covered by
United Provinces, and North Bihar were conquered by Babur.
• Rajput State of Mewar also submitted to him.
• Autobiography was Tuzuk-i-Baburi and it was translated into Persian
by Abdur Rahim Khan-i- Khana at the time of Akbar in 1590.
• Babur’s son Humayun ascended the throne of India three days after his
death.
• After Kushans, Babur was the first to bring Kabul and Kandahar into Indian
empire, which provide stability since it was staging post of invasions of
India.
• This helped in promoting trade since these towns were the starting points
of caravans meant for china in the east and Mediterranean in the west.
• He was an eminent scholar in Arabic and Persian.
• His mother tongue was Chaghatai Turkic.
• He was said to be a statesman.
• He wrote his memoirs, Tuzuk-i-Baburi inTurkish language i.e. Baburnama
Estimate of Babur
• Babur and Jahangir are the only two emperors of Mughal Empire who
wrote their own biographies.
• Baburnama is also known to be the first true autobiography in the Islamic
literature.
• Baburnama was written in Chagatai Turkic, which was Babur’s mother
tongue.
• In contrast Jahangirnama or Tuzk-i-Jahangiri was written in Persian.
Significance of Babur's advent in India
• Security from external invasions from north-west frontier
• For the first time after the downfall of the Kushana empire, Kandahar and
Kabul became the integral parts of the Mughal empire.
• Established a pan-India empire by breaking the power of the Rajput
Confederacy.
• New mode of warfare and popularised the use of gunpowder, cavalry and
artillery in India
• Devoted follower of Naqshbandiya Sufi Khwaja Ubaidullah Ahrar

Human Reproductive System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Human Reproductive System
• The reproductive events in humans include formation of gametes
(gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males and ovum in females,
transfer of sperms into the female genital tract (insemination),
fusion of male and female gametes (fertilisation) leading to
formation of zygote.
• Formation and development of blastocyst and its attachment to the
uterine wall (implantation), embryonic development (gestation)
and delivery of the baby (parturition).
Male Reproductive System
• The male reproductive system is located in
the pelvis region. It includes a pair
of testes along with accessory ducts,
glands and the external genitalia.
• The testes are situated outside the
abdominal cavity within a pouch
called scrotum. The scrotum helps
in maintaining the low temperature of
the testes (2–2.5
0C lower than the normal
internal body temperature) necessary for
spermatogenesis.
Male Reproductive System
• Each testis has about 250 testicular lobules.
Each lobule contains one to three highly
coiled seminiferous tubules in which sperms
are produced.
• Each seminiferous tubule is lined on its inside
by two types of cells called male germ cells
(spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells.
• The male germ cells undergo meiotic
divisions finally leading to sperm formation,
while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the
germ cells.
Male Reproductive System
Male Reproductive System
Male Reproductive System
• The regions outside the seminiferous tubules
called interstitial spaces, contain small blood
vessels and interstitial cells or Leydig cells.
• Leydig cells synthesise and secrete testicular
hormones called androgens [a male sex
hormone, such as testosterone. Androgens
stimulates or controls the development and
maintenance of male characteristics].
• The male sex accessory ducts include rete testis,
vasa efferentia, epididymis and vas deferens.
• The seminiferous tubules of the testis open into
the vasa efferentia through rete testis.
Male Reproductive System
• The vasa efferentia leave the testis and open into
epididymis.
• The epididymis leads to vas deferens that
ascends to the abdomen and loops over the
urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal
vesicle [gland that secrete many of the
components of semen] and opens into urethra as
the ejaculatory duct.
• These ducts store and transport the sperms from
the testis to the outside through urethra.
• The urethra originates from the urinary bladder
and extends through the penis to its external
opening called urethral meatus.
Male Reproductive System
• The penis is the male external genitalia. It is made
up of special tissue that helps in erection of the
penis to facilitate insemination. The enlarged end
of penis called the glans penis is covered by a
loose fold of skin called foreskin.
• The male accessory glands include paired seminal
vesicles, a prostate [releasing a fluid component of
semen] and paired bulbourethral glands.
• Secretions of these glands constitute the seminal
plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium and
certain enzymes.
• The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps
in the lubrication of the penis.
Female Reproductive System
• The female reproductive system consists of a pair
of ovaries along with a pair of oviducts, uterus,
cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in
pelvic region.
• These parts of the system along with a pair of the
mammary glands are integrated structurally and
functionally to support the processes of ovulation,
fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care.
• Ovaries are the primary female sex organs [testis in
males] that produce the female gamete (ovum)
[sperm in males] and several steroid
hormones (ovarian hormones).
Female Reproductive System
• The ovaries are located one on each side of the
lower abdomen. Each ovary is connected to the
pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments.
• The oviducts (fallopian tubes),
uterus and vagina constitute the female
accessory ducts.
• Each fallopian tube extends from the periphery
of each ovary to the uterus, the part closer to
the ovary is the funnel-shaped infundibulum.
Female Reproductive System
Female Reproductive System
• The edges of the infundibulum possess finger-like
projections called fimbriae, which help in collection
of the ovum after ovulation. The infundibulum leads
to a wider part of the oviduct called ampulla.
• The last part of the oviduct, isthmus has a narrow
lumen and it joins the uterus. The uterus is single and
it is also called womb. The shape of the uterus is like
an inverted pear.
• It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic
wall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow
cervix. The cavity of the cervix is called cervical canal
which along with vagina forms the birth canal.
Female Reproductive System
• The wall of the uterus has three layers of
tissue. The external thin membranous
perimetrium, middle thick layer of smooth
muscle, myometrium and inner glandular layer
called endometrium that lines the uterine
cavity.
• The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes
during menstrual cycle while
the myometrium exhibits strong contraction
during delivery of the baby.
• The female external genitalia include mons
pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and
clitoris.
Female Reproductive System
• The labia majora are fleshy folds of
tissue, surround the vaginal opening.
• The labia minora are paired folds of
tissue under the labia majora. The
opening of the vagina is often
covered partially by a membrane
called hymen.
• The clitoris is a tiny finger-like
structure which lies at the upper
junction of the two labia minora
above the urethral opening.
Female Reproductive System
• The hymen is often torn during the
first coitus (intercourse). However, it
can also be broken by a sudden fall or
jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon,
active participation in some sports like
horseback riding, cycling, etc.
• In some women the hymen persists
even after coitus. In fact, the presence
or absence of hymen is not a reliable
indicator of virginity or sexual
experience.
Gametogenesis
• The primary sex organs – the testis in the males and the ovaries in
the females produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively,
by the process called gametogenesis.
• In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce
sperms by spermatogenesis that begins at puberty.
• The spermatogonia (sing. spermatogonium) present on the inside
wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and
increase in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains
46 chromosomes.
Gametogenesis
• Some of the spermatogonia called primary spermatocytes
periodically undergo meiosis.
• A primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division
(reduction division) leading to formation of two equal, haploid
cells called secondary spermatocytes, which have only 23
chromosomes each.
• The secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic
division to produce four equal, haploid spermatids.
Gametogenesis
Gametogenesis
• Spermatogenesis starts at the age of puberty due to significant increase in
the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)/ hypothalamic
hormone.
• The increased levels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and
stimulates secretion of two gonadotropins – luteinising hormone
(LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).
• LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and secretion of
androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the process of spermatogenesis.
• FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates secretion of some factors
which help in the process of spermiogenesis.
Sperm Structure
• Sperm is a microscopic structure composed of
a head, neck, a middle piece and a tail. A
plasma membrane envelops the whole body of
sperm.
• The sperm head contains an elongated haploid
nucleus, the anterior portion of which is
covered by a cap-like structure, acrosome. The
acrosome is filled with enzymes that help
fertilization of the ovum.
• The middle piece possesses
numerous mitochondria, which produce
energy for the movement of tail that facilitate
sperm motility essential for fertilization.
Sperm Structure
• The human male ejaculates about 200 to
300 million sperms during a coitus of which,
for normal fertility, at least 60 per cent
sperms must have normal shape and size
and at least 40 per cent of them must show
vigorous motility.
• Sperms released from the seminiferous
tubules, are transported by the accessory
ducts.
• Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens,
seminal vesicle and prostate are essential
for maturation and motility of sperms.
Process of Fertilization and
Further Development
• The male gametes i.e the sperms are
deposited in the female body by the
process called as sexual intercourse.
• Once the sperms are deposited in the
vagina, they need to travel upwards to
reach the egg that is released from the
ovaries and picked up by the fallopian
tubes.
• When the sperm meets the egg, it needs
to penetrate through its layers to cause
fertilization. Both the Egg and the Sperm
fertilize and form the diploid zygote.
Process of Fertilization and
Further Development
• Each parent provides 23 chromosomes at
the initial fertilization. Thus, the zygote
contains double the number of
chromosomes (46). It is called diploid.
• Once this happens, zona pellucida from
the egg forms a thick layer around the
zygote to prevent more than one sperm
to fertilize the egg. this zygote now forms
into a morula and then into a blastocyst.
• It then develops chorionic villi from the
outer layer of the blastocyst known as
the chorion.
Process of Fertilisation and
Further Development
• These villi attach themselves to the inner
wall of the uterus.
• Implantation is the process of attachment
of the embryo to the uterine wall.
• The tissues between the growing embryo
and the mother’s uterine walls form the
placenta.
• Placenta functions to provide nutrition to
the embryo until its birth.
• The hormones estrogen and progesterone
both help in maintaining the placenta and
the fetus inside the uterus.
• The normal gestation period for humans is
38 weeks which is a little over 9 months.
Process of Fertilisation and
Further Development
• At the end of this term, the uterine
contractions begin under influence of
hormones.
• A major hormone that plays a role in this is
oxytocin. It affects the cervix and causes it
to dilate to allow the baby to pass outside
the body of the mother.
• The umbilical cord with its blood vessels
and the placenta are also expelled along
with the baby.
• The mother’s hormones come back to
normalcy from the next menstrual cycle.
Menstrual Cycle
• The reproductive cycle in the
female primates (e.g. monkeys,
apes and human beings) is called
menstrual cycle. The first
menstruation begins at puberty
and is called menarche.
• In human females, menstruation is
repeated at an average interval of
about 28/29 days, and the cycle of
events starting from one
menstruation till the next one is
called the menstrual cycle.
Menstrual Cycle
• One ovum is released (ovulation) during
the middle of each menstrual cycle. The cycle
starts with the menstrual phase, when menstrual
flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days.
• The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of
endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood
vessels which forms liquid that comes out
through vagina. Menstruation only occurs if the
released ovum is not fertilized.
• Lack of menstruation may be indicative of
pregnancy. However, it may also be caused due to
some other underlying causes like stress, poor
health etc.
Menstrual Cycle
• The menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase.
• During this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become
a fully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the
endometrium of uterus regenerates through proliferation.
• The secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually
during the follicular phase, and stimulates follicular development as
well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles.
Menstrual Cycle
• Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of
cycle (about 14 th day). Rapid secretion of LH
leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle
called LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle
and thereby the release of ovum (ovulation).
• The ovulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the
luteal phase during which the remaining parts of the
Graafian follicle transform as the corpus luteum.
• The corpus luteum secretes large amounts
of progesterone which is essential for maintenance
of the endometrium. Such an endometrium is
necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum
and other events of pregnancy.
Menstrual Cycle
• During pregnancy all events of the menstrual cycle stop and there is
no menstruation. In the absence of fertilisation, the corpus luteum
degenerates. This causes disintegration of the endometrium leading
to menstruation, marking a new cycle.
• In human beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age;
that is termed as menopause.
• Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal reproductive phase
and extends between menarche and menopause.
Pregnancy And Embryonic Development
• The placenta is connected to the embryo through
an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of
substances to and from the embryo.
• Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and
produces several hormones like human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), human placental lactogen
(hPL), estrogens, progestogens, etc.
• In the later phase of pregnancy, a hormone called
relaxin is also secreted by the ovary.
• hCG, hPL and relaxin are produced in women
only during pregnancy.
Pregnancy And Embryonic Development
• In addition, during pregnancy the levels of other hormones like
estrogens, progestogens, cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine, etc., are
increased several folds in the maternal blood.
• Increased production of these hormones is essential for supporting
the fetal growth, metabolic changes in the mother and
maintenance of pregnancy.
Parturition And Lactation
• The average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months which is called the gestation period.
• Vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus.
This process of delivery of the foetus (childbirth) is called parturition.
• Parturition is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism.
• The signals for parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta which induce
mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reflex. This triggers release of oxytocin from the
maternal pituitary.
• oxytocin secretion continues resulting in stronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion
of the baby out of the uterus through the birth canal – parturition.
• The milk produced from mammary glands during the initial few days of lactation is
called colostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to develop resistance for the
new-born babies.
• Breast-feeding during the initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up a
healthy baby.
Important Facts
• Some bisexual organism have special condition in which sperms
mature before eggs. It is known as Protandrous organism.
• Some organisms lay eggs known as oviparous.
• Some giving birth to youngone known as viviparous.
• To stop producing child there is operation; in male it is called Vasectomy
and in female it is called Tubectomy.
• Quantity of Ejaculation of semen is 4-5 ml at one point of time and each
time 20-6- crore semens are present.
• Sperms of males are produced in seminiferous tubules.
Important Facts
• Fertilization takes place in fallopian tube/ oviduct of female.
• Amniocentesis is a diagnostic procedure undergone during pregnancy. It is
most commonly used to check the baby’s chromosomes.
• Amniocentesis is performed occasionally to examine for other pregnancy
diseases such as infections or genetic disorder. This procedure looks for
the fluid substances, rather than at the baby’s chromosomes. We do not
usually need a local anesthetic. Before the procedure, the gel is applied
over the abdomen. The person is scanned to check the positions of both
the baby and the placenta (afterbirth).
Important Facts
• The amniocentesis is performed to find out:
• If the karyotype (the chromosomes) of the baby is (are) normal
• If there is evidence of a neural tube defect (spina bifida or open spine)
• If there is evidence that the baby might have had an infection
• If the lungs of the baby are ready to breathe
• Artificial Insemination: It is a technique to make a female pregnant by
artificially introducing semen of good quality into farm animals such as
cows and buffaloes.
What is Surrogacy?
• Surrogacy is the practice of bearing a child by a woman on behalf of
another woman or a couple who does not want to conceive.
• It is a by product of artificial insemination.
• Surrogate motherhood means that a woman allows a fertilized
ovum of another couple to be injected into her womb/uterus.
Test tube baby
• Also called Invitro Fertilization (IVF) and in vitro development followed by
the embryo transfer in the uterus of the normal female to start the
development and finally leading to normal birth is called test tube baby.
• First attempt to produce a test tube baby was made by an Italian scientist
Dr. Petrucci in 1959. But this human embryo survived for only 29 days.
• The world’s first test tube baby (a baby girl) named as Louise Joy Brown

Biology Fathers
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Introduction
• Biology is the life science which is derived from a Greek word 'bios'
meaning life and ‘logy’ meaning study. That is, it is a science of nature
which deals with life and living organisms, structure of life, function,
evolution, growth, distribution and taxonomy.
• The term biology was first used by scientists Lamarck and Treviranus in
1801.
• Development as a sequential knowledge of biology took place in the era of
the famous Greek philosopher Aristotle (384- 322 B.C.).
• He revealed his thoughts about various aspects of the life of plants and
animals. Therefore, Aristotle is called as the Father of Biology.

HUMAYUN and sher
shah suri
(1526-1530)
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction to Humayun
• When Babur left the throne to his eldest, lovable son
Humayun, it was not a bed of roses. When he ascended
the throne, he was a young man of 23 years, but not
without experience.
• He was one of the commanders of his father and
governed the frontier province of Badakshan,(now
Afghanistan) beyond Hindukush.
• Humayun was the eldest son of Babur and Mahan
Sultana.
• He was lacking wisdom, discretion, and strong
determination and diligence . Thus, as a king he was a
failure.
• Humayun means “fortune” but he remained the most
unfortunate ruler of the Mughal Empire.
Humayun
• Humayun divided the empire among his brothers but this proved to be a
great blunder on his part.
• Kamran (mother Gulrukh Begum ) was given Kabul and Kandahar.
Humayun had given him Multan and Punjab too.
• Sambhal and Alwar were given to Askari (mother Gulrukh Begum ) and
Hindal (mother Dildaar begum) respectively.
• Cousin brother Suleman Mirza got the area of Badakshan.
• Humayun built Dinpanah at Delhi as his second capital.
• His younger brother Kamranwas ruler of Kabul, who annexed Punjab, but
it was Humayun’s brotherly affection that he tolerated this usurpation.
Humayun
• Two other brothers were also dangerous who engaged in worthless
treacheries against their magnanimous brother.
• There were three major problems for Humayun
 In North west, it was his brother Kamran
 In east it were the Afghans
 In south it was Bahadur Shah the king of Gujarat and Malwa.
Humayun
• The Rajputs were also sitting at a striking distance from Agra.
• Six months after his succession, Humayun besieged the fortress
of Kalinjar in Bundelkhand, gained a decisive victory over Afghans
at Douhraha and drove out Sultan Mahmood Lodhi from Jaunpur, and
even defeated Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. His victories, however, were
short-lived due to the weakness of his character.
• Humayun captured Gujarat from Bahadur Shah and appointed Askari as its
governor
• But soon Bahadur Shah recovered Gujarat from Askari who fled from
there.
Humayun
• In the east, Sher Khan became powerful. Humayun marched against him
and in the Battle of Chausa, held in 1539, Sher Khan destroyed the Mughal
army and Humayun escaped from there. Here Humayun was saved by
Nizam, a water carrier (saqqa)
• Humayun reached Agra to negotiate with his brothers.
• In 1540, in the Battle of Bilgram or Ganges also known as Battle of
Kannauj, Humayun was forced to fight with Sher Khan alone and after
losing his kingdom, Humayun became an exile for the next fifteen years.
Humayun
• During his wanderings in deserts of Sindh, Humayun married Hamida
Banu Begum, daughter of Sheikh Ali Amber Jaini, who had been
a preceptor of Humayun’s brother Hindal.
• On November 23, 1542, Humayun’s wife gave birth to Akbar.
• Amarkot’s Hindu chief RanaPrasad promised Humayun to help him to
conquer Thatta/ Pakistani province of Sindh.
• Humayun first fled to Sind which was under Shah Hussain Arghuna.
• Thus, he left India and lived under the generosity of Shah Tahmashp of
Persia.
Humayun
• Shah of Persia agreed to help Humayun and lend him a force of 14,000
men on a condition to confirm to Shia creed, to have the Shah’s name
proclaimed in his Khutba and to give away Kandhar to him on his success.
• In 1545, with Persian help, Humayun captured Kandhar and Kabul but
refused to cede Kandhar to Persia.
• Later, he defeated his brothers Kamran and Askari.
• He had the chance to return in 1555. Sher Shah Suri, the victor of Battle of
Kannauj, died in 1545.
Humayun
• Sher shah was succedded by his son Islam Shah who ruled upto 1553.
• He was succedded by Adil Shah Suri. He was very fond of pleasures and
left the affairs of his government in the hands of Hemu, his minister.
• His authority was challenged by Ibrahim Shah Suri and Sikander shah suri.
• There was large number of bloody battles among the various rivals. The
net result of all this was that Sur empire was broken up.
• In 1555, Humayun defeated the Afghans and recovered the Mughal throne
• Bairam khan, humayun’s most faithful officer helped him in regaining the
Indian reigns.
Humayun
• After six months, he died in 1556 due to his fall from the staircase of his library
(Sher Mandal, Delhi)
• It is said about him that Humayun tumbled through life and he tumbled out of
it (by the historian Lanepool)
• Humayun was kind and generous, though he was not a good General and
warrior.
• HE earned the title of Insan-i-kamil (Perfect man) for his peaceful personality
and patience.
• He also loved painting and wrote poetry in the Persian language.
• Humayun was portrayed in his biography “Humayunnama” written by his sister
Gulbadan Begum.
SUR DYNASTY or SUR Interregnum
(1540-1555)
• After Ibrahim Lodi was defeated by Babur in 1526 AD
(first battle of Panipat), the Afghan chiefs who were still
powerful, gathered together under the leadership of Sher
Shah Suri to mark their discontent against the alien rule.
• As a result the Sur Empire of Pashtun origin (the tribal
house of Sur) came to power and ruled a massive
territory of Northern part of South Asia from 1540-1556
AD, with their capital as Delhi.
• The empire’s major strength is in the fact that it
disturbed the hold of the Mughal Empire under
Humayun.
Sher Shah’s Administration
• Sher Shah was the founder of Sur Dynasty.
• His original name was Farid.
• He was the son of Hasan Khan, a jagirdar of Sasaram in Bihar.
• He was given the title Sher Khan for his bravery by Babar Khan Lohani
(Governor of Bihar)
Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545)

refugee with Humayun.
 6. Conquest of Punjab (1540-42 AD): He immediately conquered
Punjab from Kamran (Brother of Humayun) after his accession to the
throne .
Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545)
 7. Suppression of Khokhars (1542 AD): He suppressed the turbulent
Khokhars of the northern region of river Indus and Jhelum.
 8. Conquest of Malwa (1542 AD): The ruler of Malwa had not helped
Sher Shah in his struggle with Humayun. Therefore he attacked Malwa
and annexed it to his empire.
 9. Conquest of Raisin: He attacked Raisin – a Rajput principality and
besieged it.
Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545)
 10. Conquest of Multan and Sind (1543 AD): Sher Shah conquered
and annexed these provinces into his empire.
 11. Conquest of Marwar (1543-1545 AD): He brought Marwar under
his control by forged letters and sowing dissensions in the army of
Maldev, the ruler of Mewar.
 12. Conquest of Kalinjar (1545 AD) and death of Sher Shah: He
launched a fierce attack. He won but lost his life when he was
grievously injured by the blast.

Bundelkhand, Malwa, Multan,
Punjab, and Sind.

North India except Assam, Gujarat,
Kashmir, and Nepal.

MUGHAL EMPIRE
Akbar
(1556-1605)
By Dr Vipan Goyal

AKBAR (1556-1605)
• Akbar’s position was in dangerous when he succeeded his father
Humayun as Delhi was seized by the Afghans.
• Jalal ud Din Mohammad Akbar, a name, a legacy in itself, was born
to King Humayun and Begum Hamida Banu, while they were in exile
in the year 1542.
• When Humayun was retreating from Bikaner, he was gallantly
offered shelter and help by the Rana of Amarkot.
AKBAR (1556-1605)
• It was at Amarkot, in 1542, that Akbar, the greatest of the Mughal rulers,
was born.
• He was keenly interested in learning all warfare techniques and was totally
disinterested in reading or writing.
• He was in fact not at all educated yet he had a keen interest in gaining
knowledge about many things.
• At a very small age of just 13 years Jalal, was conferred the title of
Shehanshah Akbar under the keen guidance of Bairam Khan.
• In 1556, Akbar was crowned at Kalanaur at the age of merely thirteen
years and four months.
AKBAR (1556-1605)
• It was in Bairam’s command that Akbar's army defeated Hemu
Vikramaditya in the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556 AD.
• Hemu, the PM of Adil Shah Suri, was defeated. Hemu is considered the
last Hindu King of Delhi. He was 14th and last king who took the title of
Vikramaditya.
• During the first 5 years of Akbar’s reign, Bairam Khan acted as his
regent.
• Later, Akbar removed Bairam Khan and sent him to Mecca but Bairam
Khan was killed by an Afghan ruler Mubarak Khan on his way at Patan,
Gujarat.
AKBAR (1556-1605)
• The period 1560-62 is also referred to as ‘Petticoat Government’s
rule as the nurse of Akbar, Maham Anga (often called Akbar’s foster
mother) attempted to keep Akbar as a puppet ruler after Bairam
Khan’s death. She died in 1562.
• He conquered Malwa in 1561 defeating Baz Bahadur.
• He was later made the Mansabdar to honour his skill as a musician.
• Then defeated Garh-Katanga (ruled by Rani Durgawati) followed by
Chittor and Ranthambore.


Akbar’s Relation with Rajputs
• Akbar followed a policy of reconcillation with the Rajputs. Some of the
Rajput Princes entered into matrimonial alliances with him.
• In 1562, when Akbar was going to Ajmer, Bhara Mal paid personal homage
to Akbar, and cemented the alliance by marrying his younger
daughter, Harkha Bai, to Akbar.
• For four generation, the Rajputs served the Mughals and many served in
the positions of military generals as well.
• Akbar appointed Raja Man Singh and Raja Bhagawan Das in the senior
position of the Mughal Administration.
Akbar’s Relation with Rajputs
• Though majority of the Rajput states surrendered to Akbar, the Ranas of
Mewar continued to confront even though they were defeated several times.
• In 1576, the Mughal Army led by Raja Man Singh and Asaf Khan defeated Rana
Pratap Singh in the battle of Haldighati. Maharana Pratap had to flee the field
on his trusted Chetak.
• Akbar’s policy towards Rajput was combined with a broad religious toleration.
• All these activities paved the way for friendship between Rajputs and Mughals
(except Mewar).
Akbar’s Relation with Rajputs
• He won Gujarat in 1572. It was in order to commemorate his victory of
Gujarat that Akbar got the Buland Darwaza constructed (in 1602) at
Fatehpur Sikri.
• In 1586, he conquered Kashmir and in 1593, he conquered Sindh.
• His last conquest was at the fort of Asirgarh in Deccan. (Fort is key to
Deccan)
• At his death in 1605, his empire included Kashmir, Sindh, Kalandhar and
extended as far as Godavari in the Deccan.
Akbar’s Religious Policy
• Akbar was not an extreme Muslim rather he is known for his tolerance
towards all the religions. This is what made him so famous amongst his
people.
• Akbar made many religious matrimonial alliances through which he sent a
message of unity and togetherness. His marriage to the Rajput princess
Jodha, says volumes about his kindness.
• Akbar got a temple constructed for Jodha in his palace, even though there
was a lot of opposition for the same.
Akbar’s Religious Policy
• He allowed his Hindu wives to worship their own gods.
• He appointed learned Hindu Pundits at important Government posts.
• He talked to general people and heard their woes at DIWAN-E-AAM.
• He interacted with Hindu Muslim and Christian scholars on important
issues in DIWAN-E-KHAAS.
• The policy of religious tolerance known as Sul-i Kul (Peace with all) was
basically aimed at proper functioning of political and administrative
machinery of the Empire.
Akbar’s Religious Policy
• Akbar gave the title of Jagat Guru to Harivijaya Suri and yug pradhan to
JinChandra Suri.
• In 1575, Akbar built Ibadat Khana (House of worship) at his new capital
Fatepur Sikri and invited scholars from all religions like Christianity,
Hinduism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism. ( like Purshottam Das/ Hindu,
Maharaji Rana/ Parsi, Harivijaya Suri/ Jain, Monserate and Aquaviva/
Christain)
• He did not like the intrusion of the Muslim Ulemas in political matters.
Akbar’s Religious Policy
• Like other Muslim monarchs, Akbar was, at least in theory, subordinate to
the wishes of entire Muslim population (millat), which, in turn, was
guided by the Muslim learned divines called the Ulema.
• Akbar sought to remove this check to his will and became the supreme
authority over his Muslim subjects by promulgating
the Infallibility Decree (Mazhar) in September 1579 and proclaimed title
Sultan-i-Adil.
Akbar’s Religious Policy
• Akbar believed that the king must be absolutely tolerant to every
creed and must establish universal peace in his dominion.
• Akbar abolished the Pilgrimage tax in 1563 and Jizya in 1564 as both
were based on religion discrimination.
• In 1582, he propagated a new religion called Din Ilahi or Divine
Faith.
• Akbar’s so-called Din-i Ilahi was an amalgam of Sufism,
Hinduism and Zoroastrianism.
About Din Ilahi (Tauhid-i-Ilahi)
• Birbal (first and last Hindu), Abul Fazal and Faizi joined the order.
• The new religion believed in one God. It had all the good points of every
religion. Its foundation was balanced.
• It didn’t endorse any philosophy. It aimed at bridging the gap that
separated different religions.
• The new religion had only 15 followers including Birbal.
• Akbar did not compel anyone to join his new religion. However, the new
religion proved to be a failure, after Akbar’s death
Land Revenue Administration
• With the help of Raja Todar Mal, Akbar experimented on the land
revenue administration, which was completed in 1580.
• The land revenue system was called Zabti or Bandobast system or
Dahsala System.
• The revenue was fixed on the average yield of land measured on
the basis of previous ten years.
Land Revenue Administration
• The land was divided into four categories
1. Polaj (cultivated every year)
2. Parauti (once in two years)
3. Chachar (once in three or four years)
4. Banjar (once in five or more years)
• Payment of revenue was made generally in cash.
• Bigha was adopted as standard unit of area ( 60 X 60 yards).
• A new gaz or yard, gaz-i-Ilahi was introduced.
Mansabdari System
• Akbar introduced the Mansabdari system in his administration in 1575.
(borrowed from Persia) to organize the nobility as well as the army.
• Under this system every officer was assigned a rank (Mansab)
• Princes of royal blood received even higher ranks.
• The ranks were divided into two – Zat and Sawar.
• Zat means personal and it fixed the personal status of a person. It was
conferred by a king on mansabdar.
• Sawar rank indicated the number of cavalrymen of a person who was
required to maintain. Every sawar had to maintain at least two horses.
• All appointments, promotions and dismissals were directly made by the
emperor.
Art and Culture
• Besides being a dedicated ruler Akbar was also a great patron for art and culture.
• He enjoyed the company of poets and singers and all types of artistic people.
• His forts and palaces in and around Delhi are great masterpieces of unmatched
workmanship.
• Few amongst those are Fatehpur Sikri, Allahabad Fort, and Agra Fort etc.
• He was also a great lover of music and poetry, his durbar was a unique
amalgamation of great artists, scholars, poet, and singers etc. who kept the aura
happy.
• This love for culture made him collects his “Nine Jewels or Naurattans” who excelled
in their fields of art and knowledge.

Animal Tissue
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Animal Tissue
• A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together
to achieve a particular function forms a tissue.
• A group of tissues with the same functions forms an organ and
group of organs forms an organ system.
• The group of organ system make an organism.

Animal Tissue
• There are four types of tissue found in an animal.
1. Epithelial tissue
2. Connective tissue
3. Muscle tissue
4. Nervous tissue
• Multicellular (large) organisms function more efficiently if cells
become specialized for specific functions.
• A tissue is composed of cells that function together in a specialized
activity.
Animal Tissue
• EPITHELIAL TISSUE
 Forming tight covering and protecting layers below.
 (largest organ- skin, largest gland- liver)
• CONNECTIVE TISSUE
 Holding other tissues together and are surrounded by lots of
non living material.
Animal Tissue
• MUSCLE TISSUE
 Shortening and lengthening to move other tissues.
• NERVOUS TISSUE
 Allowing rapid flow of ions in and out to conduct signals
Epithelial Tissues
• The skin, the lining of the mouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung
alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of epithelial tissue.
Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed and form a continuous
sheet.
• They have only a small amount of cementing material between
them and almost no intercellular spaces.
• Obviously, anything entering or leaving the body must cross at least
one layer of epithelium.
Epithelial Tissues
• As a result, the permeability of the cells of various epithelia play an
important role in regulating the exchange of materials between the
body and the external environment and also between different
parts of the body.
• Two types of epithelial tissues
 Covering and lining epithelium (outer layer of the skin and some
organs)
 Glandular epithelium (constitute the secreting portion of
glands)
Epithelial Tissues
• There are three types of cells in epithelial tissues
 Squamous – thin flat cells eg: oesophagus and the lining of the
mouth, Skin epithelial cells are arranged in many layers to
prevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged in a pattern of
layers, the epithelium is called stratified squamous epithelium.
 Cuboidal - cells are roughly square, forms the lining of kidney
tubules and ducts of salivary glands, where it provides
mechanical support.
 Columnar- elongated cells
Glandular Epithelium
• Epithelial cells often acquire additional specialisation as gland cells,
which can secrete substances at the epithelial surface. Sometimes a
portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward, and a multicellular
gland is formed. This is glandular epithelium.
• Two types of glands :
 EXOCRINE- secrete their products into ducts. Eg: salivary glands
and mammary glands
 ENDOCRINE – secrete their products into blood stream. Eg :
Pancreas
Functions of Epithelial Tissues
• Provides physical protection
• Control permeability
• Detects sensations (sight, smell, taste)
Connective Tissues
• Most abundant and most widely distributed tissues in the body. These
tissues provide support for organs and the body as a whole, protect and
insulate internal organs and compartmentalize structures such as skeletal
muscles, nerves. It is made up of cells, ground substances and fibers.
• Ground substances together with fibers make matrix.
• Connective tissues can be classified as:
 Loose connective tissue(fibers are loosely woven)
 Dense connective tissue(few cells among a dense network of fibers
with little ground substances)
Connective Tissues classification
 Cartilage(tough but flexible)
 Areolar connective tissue is found between the skin and muscles,
around blood vessels and nerves and in the bone marrow. It fills the
space inside the organs, supports internal organs and helps in repair of
tissues.
 Blood tissue – (composed of blood cells, cell fragments and blood
plasma)
 Bone tissue(two types; compact and spongy)
o Compact – with osteons
o Spongy – no osteons
Connective Tissues classification
 ADIPOSE TISSUES
o Fat or adipose tissue is an anatomical term for loose
connective tissue composed of adipocytes.
o Its main role is to store energy in the form of fat, although it
also cushions and insulates the body.
Connective Tissues classification
 TENDONS
o Tendons connect
BONE to MUSCLE.
The Achilles tendon
is the largest and
strongest tendon in
the body.
Connective Tissues classification
 LIGAMENT
o Ligaments connect
BONE to BONE. The
longest ligament founds
in the human body is
the ligament of
Plantaris.
Muscle Tissue
• They are elongated and are called as
muscle fibers. This tissue is
responsible for movement in our
body. Muscles contain special
proteins called contractile proteins,
which contract and relax to cause
movement.(actin and myosin, actin
and myosin are reponsible for Rigor
Mortis)
Muscle Tissue
• Muscle cells have main properties:
 Excitability (ability to respond to stimuli)
 Contractibility (ability to contract)
 Elasticity (ability to returns to its original shape)
 Extensibility (ability to be stretched without tearing)
 Muscle tissue is classified into three types (cardiac, skeletal and
smooth)
Skeletal Muscles
• These are known as striated muscles or voluntary muscles.
• These muscles are attached to bones by tendons and are
responsible for skeletal movements.
• Basic unit of a skeletal muscle is a muscle fiber. The cells of this
tissue are long, cylindrical, unbranched and multinucleate (having
many nuclei).
Cardiac Muscles
• These are unique and found only in the wall of the heart. These
muscles are involuntary in action. They don’t get fatigued(because
of no formation of lactic acid).
Smooth Muscles
• These are made up of thin elongated muscle cells, called smooth
muscle fibers.
• These fibers are pointed at their ends and each has a single, large
oval nucleus.
• Each cell has many myofibrils which lies parallel to one another in
striated pattern, as in skeletal muscles.
• They are found in the iris of the eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of
the lungs.
Nervous Tissue
• It is found in the brain, spinal cord and nerves and consists of only two
principal kinds of cells, neurons and neuroglial.
• Neuroglial cells that do not transmit impulses but instead support the
activities of the neurons.
• Schwann cells, a type in the peripheral nevous system found only in
mammals.
• Cells of nervous tissue have three
principal parts:
 Dendrites - Many short, branched
parts (processes) called dendrites.
 Cell body- contains nucleus and
cytoplasm.
 Axon – Each neuron has a single
long part (process), called the axon.
Nervous Tissue
• All information from our environment is detected by the specialised tips of
some nerve cells.
• These receptors are usually located in our sense organs, such as the inner
ear, the nose, the tongue, and so on.
• So gustatory receptors will detect taste while olfactory receptors will
detect smell.
• The information, acquired at the end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell,
sets off a chemical reaction that creates an electrical impulse.
• This impulse travels from the dendrite to the cell body, and then along the
axon to its end.
Nervous Tissue
• At the end of the axon, the electrical impulse sets off the release of some
chemicals.
• These chemicals cross the gap, or synapse, and start a similar electrical
impulse in a dendrite of the next neuron.
• This is a general scheme of how nervous impulses travel in the body.
• A similar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to
other cells, such as muscles cells or gland.
• Nervous tissues are the only tissues in the human body that do not
regenerate. Neuron is the largest cell the human body.

Diseases
By Dr Vipan Goyal

DISEASES
Types of Diseases: On the basis of its nature, character and
causes of its spreading is of two types:
Congenital Disease Acquired Disease
Disease is a situation where a person is not at ease,
Therefore, Disease.
Congenital Disease
• Congenital Disease is the diseases which are present since birth.
• These are caused due to genetic abnormality or due to metabolic
disorders or malfunctioning of any organ.
• They are basically permanent, generally not easily curable and may
be inherited to the children like Harelip, Cleft Palate, Club foot etc.
• Also due to imbalance in the chromosomes the appearance of
Mongalism, are also some examples of it.
Acquired Disease
• Acquired Disease is those defects or disorders which are not present by
birth but appear due to the various causes and factors. These may be
further categorized into following heads:
I. Communicable or infectious diseases: These are caused by a variety
of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and worms. The
pathogens are generally carried with the help of a vector.
II. Non-communicable or non-infectious or degenerative
diseases: These occur due to the malfunctioning of some organ or
organ system in the body.
 It may be of various types like Deficiency diseases: These occur due
to the deficiency of some nutrients, minerals or vitamins, Cancerous
diseases, Allergy, Genetic diseases.
Diseases Spread through Blood Transfusion
• AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome): It destroys immune
system of the body & is caused by the Human Immuno deficiency
Virus (HIV).
• There are two types of HIV namely HIV-1 and HIV-2.
• The most common virus currently associated with AIDS is HIV-1.
• A virus found in the blood of wild African green monkey called the Simian
Immuno deficiency Virus (SIV) is similar to HIV-2.
• HIV is a retrovirus. It can synthesize DNA from RNA.
• The major cell infected by HIV is the helper T-Iymphocyte that bears the
CD-4 receptor site.
• HIV progressively destroys T-Iymphocytes. The patient occasionally
will suffer from swollen lymph nodes, mild prolonged fever,
diarrhoea or other non-specific symptoms.
• Important facts about AIDS
 AIDS in India was first reported in 1986 and is the end stage of
the disease.
 HIV antibodies can be detected by the ELISA test (Enzyme-Linked
Immuno Sorbent Assay).
 World AIDS Day is celebrated on 1st December.

MUGHAL EMPIRE
Jahangir
(1605-1627)
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Jahangir (1605-1627)
• In 1605, Prince Salim succeeded with the title
Jahangir (Conqueror of World) after the death of
Akbar.
Birth of Salim
• Prince Salim was born to father Akbar and mother
Harkha Bai due to the blessing of the holy man
Salim Chisti.
• Salim Chisti was one of the descendents of Khwaja
Moinuddin Chisti of Ajmer.
• Akbar named his son Salim with due respect to the
holy saint.
• Akbar called him Sheikhubaba.
• He was the student of Bairam khan’s son AbdurRahim-Khan-i-Khana.
Jahangir (1605-1627)
• He gave his father the terminating shock by killing Abul Fazal in 1602.
• He was of a violent temperament and like his other two despicable
brothers Murad and Daniyal, he was a notorious and drunkard.
• The coin in which he has been engraved with a wine cup in his hand is a
testimony to his habit as a habitual drunkard.
• However, when he ascended the throne, he was a man of 37 years and
had become “mature”.
Jahangir (1605-1627)
• After his coronation, he assumed the title of Nur-ud-din Muhammad
Jahangir Badshah Ghazi.
• He continued to be sober in the day time and introduced famous
regulations such as forbidding sale of wine and even tobacco.
• Jahangir mostly lived in lahore which he adorned with gardens and
buildings.
• He defeated and imprisoned Son Khusrau.
• He also beheaded Guru Arjun, the 5
th Sikh Guru and one of the supporters
of Khusrau.
Jahangir (1605-1627)
• One of his supporters, Guru Arjun, the fifth Sikh Guru, was beheaded.
• Rana Amar Singh (son of Maharana Pratap) of Mewar submitted before
Jahangir in 1615.
• Rana’s son Karan Singh was made a mansabdar in the Mughal court.
• Faced a formidable opponent in Malik Amber in his expedition to
Ahmednagar. This was led by Akbar’s son Khurram but ended in treaty.
• Jahangir also won Kangra.
• His greatest failure was the loss of Kandahar to Persia in 1622.
Nur Jahan
• In 1611, Jahangir married Mehrunnisa who was known as Nur Jahan (Light
of World). She was the widow of Sher Afgani in 1611. The title NurJahan
was conferred on her by Jahangir.
• She had great influence on Jahangir’s life, as she was given the status of
Padshah Begum, coins were struck in her name and all royal farmans
beared her name.
• She got high position for her father Itmad-ud-daulah and her brother Asaf
Khan.
Nur Jahan
• Asaf Khan elder brother of Nur Jahan was appointed as Khan-i-Saman, a
post reserved for the nobles.
• In 1612, Asaf Khan’s daughter, Arjumand Banu Begum (later known as
Mumtaj), married Jahangir’s third son, prince Khurram (later Shah Jahan).
• This alliance practically ruled the empire for 10 years.
• Problems arose whe Nurjahan married her daughter Ladali Begum by Sher
Afgani to Jahangir’s youngest son Shahrayar.
• Now Nurjahan supported him for the heir apparent.
Nur Jahan
• All these events hampered the military events for the recovery of
Kandahar.
• Nur Jahan’s marriage with Jahangir almost eclipsed his personality.
• Jahangir in his biography ‘Tuzuk-i-Jahangir’ himself wrote “I have sold my
kingdom to my beloved queen for a cup of wine and a dish of soup.”
Restoration of Mohammaden Faith
• This son of a philosopher King and a Rajput princess professed himself as a
Muslim and restored the Mohammaden faith and Hijra Chronology (on
coins) his father had abandoned.
• But, like his father, he was tolerant towards Hindus and equally tolerant
towards the Christians. He continued to marry the princesses of the Rajput
aristocrats.
The Justice Bell (Zanzir-i-Adil)
• He was active in redressing the grievance of the people and had a
golden chain and bell attached to the gate of his palace in Agra, so
that all who wished to appeal to him could ring him up.
• However, it is not clear, who was eligible to ring the emperor up.
Painting
• Jahangir’s tenure is called golden age of painting.
• Ustad Mansur and abul Hasan was famous painter.
• Jahangir has given the title of Nadir-ul-Jamat to Abul Hasan and Nadil-ulAsar to Ustad Mansur.
• Jahangir has started painting school ( chitranshala) in Agra under Akarija (
painter of herat)
Important Facts
• In 1622-23 ShahJahan (Khurram) and in 1626 Mahabat Khan mughal
general revolted against Jahangir.
• Mahabat khan kept Jahangir in jail near Jhelum river.
• Nur Jahan played a very important role to suppress the revolt of Mahabat
Khan
• Nurjahan’s mother Asmat Begum known for having invented the famous
rose perfume called Jahangiri-itr, which was described by Jahangir as the
discovery of his reign
Important Facts
• Jahangir also started system of Do Aspa (mansabdar have to kept 2 times
horses) and Singh Aspa (mansabdar have to kept 3 times horses)
• He also laid a number of gardens such as Shalimar and Nishat Gardens in
Kashmir.
• Two visitors namely Captain William Hawkins and Sir Thomas Roe came to
the court of Jahangir. The latter who was the ambassador of King James
was able to get permission from Jahangir allowing the English to trade at
Surat. With the passage of time, trade was followed by rule of the English
over India.
Important Facts
• Jahangir called Hawkins as English Khan.
• Pietra Valle, famous Italian traveler came during his reign.
• Tobacco growing started during his reign. It was brought by
Portugese. Jahangir prohibited the smoking use of tobacco in 1617.
• Jahangir buried in Lahore where Nurjahan has constructed a tomb.

Genetics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Mendel’s Experiments on Inheritance
• Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from
parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity.
• Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents.
• It was only during the mid-nineteenth century that a major
headway was made in the understanding of inheritance.
Law of Inheritance by Gregor Mendel
• John Mendel is the father of Genetics. He experimented on Pea Plant / Pisum Sativum.
• W. Watson used the term Genetics for the first time.
• Wilhelm Johannsen coined the word "gene".
• Gene is a unit of inheritance.
• William Bateson in 1905 coined the term genetics from the word gene.
• Mendel gave four laws and they are :
• (1) Principles of Paired Factors
• (2) Principle of Dominance
• (3) Law of Segregation or Law of Purity of Gametes (Mendel's First Law of Inheritance)
• (4) Law of Independent Assortment (Mendel's Second Law of Inheritance).
Law of Dominance
• Characters are controlled by discrete
units called factors.
• Factors occur in pairs. [pair of alleles]
• In a dissimilar pair of factors one
member of the pair dominates
(dominant) the other (recessive).
• The law of dominance is used to explain
the expression of only one of the
parental characters in a monohybrid
cross [Mendel’s Experiments on
Inheritance] in the F1 and the expression
of both in the F 2. It also explains the
proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F2.
Law of Segregation
• This law is based on the fact that the alleles do
not show any blending and that both the
characters are recovered as such in the F 2
generation though one of these is not seen at the
F1 stage.
• Though the parents contain two alleles during
gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair
segregate from each other such that a gamete
receives only one of the two factors [either
dominant or recessive].
• Of course, a homozygous parent produces all
gametes that are similar while a heterozygous
one produces two kinds of gametes each having
one allele with equal proportion.
Incomplete Dominance
• When experiments on peas were repeated using
other traits in other plants, it was found that
sometimes the F 1 had a phenotype that did not
resemble either of the two parents and was in
between the two.
• In a cross between true-breeding red-flowered
(RR) and truebreeding white-flowered plants
(rr), the F1 (Rr) was pink. When the F1 was selfpollinated the F 2 resulted in the following ratio
1 (RR) Red : 2 (Rr) Pink: 1 (rr) White.
• Here the genotype ratios were exactly as we
would expect in any mendelian monohybrid
cross, but the phenotype ratios had changed
from the 3:1 dominant : recessive ratio.
Co-dominance
• Till now we were discussing crosses where the F1 resembled either of
the two parents (dominance) or was in-between (incomplete
dominance). But, in the case of co-dominance the F 1
generation resembles both parents.
• A good example is different types of red blood cells that determine
ABO blood grouping in human beings.
• ABO blood groups are controlled by the gene I. The plasma membrane
of the red blood cells has sugar polymers that protrude from its
surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the gene.
• The gene (I) has three alleles IA, IB and i.
Co-dominance
• The alleles IA and IB produce a slightly different form of the
sugar while allele i does not produce any sugar.
• Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses any
two of the three I gene alleles.
• IA and IB are completely dominant over i, in other words when IA
and i are present only IA expresses (because i does not produce any
sugar), and when IB and i are present IB expresses.
• But when IA and IB are present together they both express their
own types of sugars: this is because of co-dominance. Hence red
blood cells have both A and B types of sugars.
Co-dominance
Here there are 6 Genotypes and 4 Phenotypes [A, B, AB and O]
Law of Independent Assortment
• The law states that ‘when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid,
segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of
characters’.
Law of Independent Assortment
• In the dihybrid cross, the phenotypes round,
yellow; wrinkled, yellow; round, green and
wrinkled, green appeared in the ratio 9:3:3:1.
• Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of
characters that Mendel studied. The ratio of
9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series
of 3 yellow: 1 green, with 3 round : 1 wrinkled.
This derivation can be written as follows: (3
Round : 1 Wrinkled) (3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9
Round, Yellow : 3 Wrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round,
Green : 1 Wrinkled, Green.
Linkage and Recombination
• Morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses
in Drosophila to study genes that were sexlinked. The crosses were similar to the
dihybrid crosses carried out by Mendel in
peas.
• Morgan attributed this due to the physical
association or linkage of the two genes and
coined the term linkage to describe this
physical association of genes on a
chromosome and the term recombination
to describe the generation of non-parental
gene combinations.
Sex Determination
• Among the males an X-chromosome is present but its counterpart
is distinctly smaller and called the Y-chromosome. Females,
however, have a pair of X-chromosomes.
• Both males and females bear same number of autosomes. Hence,
the males have autosomes plus XY, while female have autosomes
plus XX.
• [one pair of sex chromosome (XX or XY) + 22 pairs of autosomes
== total 23 pairs of chromosomes in a human cell nucleus]
Mutation
• Mutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA
sequences and consequently results in changes in the genotype and
the phenotype of an organism.
• In addition to recombination, mutation is another phenomenon
that leads to variation in DNA.
• DNA helix runs continuously from one end to the other in each
chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form. Therefore loss
(deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of DNA,
result in alteration in chromosomes.
Mutation
• Since genes are known to be located on chromosomes, alteration in
chromosomes results in abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal
aberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.
• In addition to the above, mutation also arise due to change in a single
base pair of DNA. This is known as point mutation. A classic example of
such a mutation is sickle cell anemia.
• Deletions and insertions of base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift
mutations.
• There are many chemical and physical factors that induce mutations.
These are referred to as mutagens. UV radiations can cause mutations in
organisms – it is a mutagen.
Mendelian Disorders
• It is important to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may
be dominant or recessive.
• By pedigree analysis one can easily understand whether the trait in
question is dominant or recessive.
• Similarly, the trait may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case
of haemophilia.
• It is evident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from
carrier female to male progeny.
Haemophilia
• This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its transmission from
unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny has been
widely studied.
• In this disease, a single protein that is a part of the cascade of
proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to this, in
an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding.
• The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit
the disease to sons.
Haemophilia
• The possibility of a female becoming
a haemophilic is extremely rare
because mother of such a female has
to be at least carrier and the father
should be haemophilic (unviable in
the later stage of life).
• The family pedigree of Queen
Victoria shows a number of
haemophilic descendents as she was
a carrier of the disease.
Sickle-Cell Anaemia
• This is an autosome linked
recessive trait. The defect is caused
by the substitution of Glutamic acid
(Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth
position of the beta globin chain of
the haemoglobin molecule.
• The mutant haemoglobin molecule
undergoes polymerization under low
oxygen tension causing the change in
the shape of the RBC from biconcave
disc to elongated sickle like structure.
Phenylketonuria
• This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as the autosomal
recessive trait.
• The affected individual lacks an enzyme that converts the amino
acid phenylalanine into tyrosine.
• As a result of this phenylalanine is accumulated and converted
into phenylpyruvic acid and other derivatives.
• Accumulation of these in brain results in mental retardation. These
are also excreted through urine because of its poor absorption by
kidney.
Phenylketonuria
Down’s Syndrome
• The cause of this genetic disorder is
the presence of an additional
copy of the chromosome number
21 (trisomy of 21). This disorder was
first described by Langdon Down
(1866).
• The affected individual is short
statured.
• It is also called Mangolism.
Klinefelter’s Syndrome
• This genetic disorder is also caused
due to the presence of an additional
copy of X-chromosome resulting
into a karyotype of 47, XXY.
• Such an individual has overall
masculine development, however,
the feminine development
(development of breast, i.e.,
Gynaecomastia) is also expressed.
Such individuals are sterile.
Turner’s Syndrome
• Such a disorder is caused due to
the absence of one of the X
chromosomes, i.e., 45 with X0.
Such females are sterile as
ovaries are rudimentary besides
other features including lack of
other secondary sexual
characters.
Patau’s Syndrome
• Addition of autosomal chromosome
in 13th chromosome.
• Cut mark in the upper lip and
person is mentally retarded.
Cri-du-chat Syndrome
• Deletion of short arm of 5
th chromosome and translocation to 15th
chromosomes.

MUGHAL EMPIRE
Shah Jahan
(1627-1658)
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Shah Jahan (1627-1658)
• Shah Jahan was born in Lahore, Pakistan to Prince Salim (Emperor
Jahangir) and his Rajput wife from Marwar Princess Jagat Gosaini.
• Her official Mughal name was Bilqis Makani. Shah Jahan’s
grandfather was Akbar.
• When Jahangir died, Khurram was away in Deccan. So Nurjahan
supported and try to make Shaharyar the King.
• But Asaf, miffed by his sister’s action, sent a speedy message to
Khurram and set up Khurram’s son Dawar Baksh as ad hoc regent.
Shah Jahan (1627-1658)
• He attacked Shaharyar and took him as prisoner. Khurram while
hastening from Deccan had already sent orders to eliminate
Shaharyar. The orders were immediately carried out.
• Thus In 1628 Khurram ascended the Mughal Throne with the name
Shah Jahan (the King of the world) in Agra and got the title of
Shahbudin Muhammad Sahib Kiran-i-sani .

Shah Jahan (1627-1658)
• He was able general and administrator. He transferred Mughal Capital
from Agra to Delhi.
• A French traveler (Jeweler) Tavernier visited during his reign and has
described him as a King who has firm administration of Justice and
Universal sense of security. He estimated the cost of the Peacock Throne
of Shah Jahan around 6.5 million sterling.
• He described Shah Jahan as the king who had Universal sense of security
as well as sense of Justice.
• He had to face revolts in BundelKhand (Jujjhar singh Bundela of Orchha)
and in the Deccan (Khan-i-Jahan Lodi) in the initial years.
Shah Jahan (1627-1658)
• His Deccan policy was more successful.
• He defeated the forces of Ahmednagar/ Malik Amber and seized it.
And got the title shah jahan from Jahangir.
• Both Bijapur and Golkonda signed a treaty with the emperor.
• Shah Jahan engraved four Mughal provinces in the Deccan –
Khandesh, Berar, Telungana and Daulatabad
• Another title given to Shah Jahan was "The Builder of the Marvels",
as he had a remarkable ability of designing new structures redesigning old forts.
Shah Jahan (1627-1658)
• He has given the monopoly of business of salt to Portuguese that’s
why he got the area of Hugli in 1632 for his kindness but later he
expelled Portuguese as they are abusing their trading privileges.
• Shah Jahan launched a continued war in the northwest frontier to
recover Kandahar and other ancestral lands. (sent three
expeditions).
• In 1639 he secured Kandhar but Persia wrested Kandhar from
Mughals in 1649.
War of Succession
• The last years of Shah Jahan’s reign were clouded by a bitter war of
succession among his four sons
1. Dara Shikoh (crown prince)
2. Shuja (governor of Bengal)
3. Aurangzeb (governor of Deccan)
4. Murad Baksh (governor of Malwa and Gujarat)
• Dara was his favorite but Aurangzeb was the ablest.
• Aurangzeb emerged victorious in this struggle
War of Succession
• Aurengzeb entered the Agra Fort after defeating Dara
• He forced Shah Jahan to surrender
• Shah Jahan lived for eight long years lovingly nursed by his daughter
Jahanara.
• Shah Jahan era is also known as Golden age of Architecture.
• 2 Frenchmen, Bernier and Tavernier and an Italian adventurer
Manucci visited during his reign.
Literature
• Gangadhar and Jagannath pandit ( who wrote ganga lahiri) was the
court poet of Shah Jahan.
• Abdul hamid lahori wrote padshahnama and Inayat Khan wrote
Shahnama.
• Dara shikoh learnt Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian languages. He
translated the upanashids with the name of Sirar-i-Akbar
• Shahjahan gave the title of Shahbuland Iqbal to Dara.

Aurangazeb
(1658-1707)
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Aurangazeb (1658-1707)
• Shah Jahan had four sons ( Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, Aurangzeb and Murad
Baksh in sequence) and three daughters ( Jahan Ara, Roshan Ara and
Gauhar Ara)
• There was a battle of succession between the sons of Shah Jahan.
• Aurangzeb first defeated the imperial army in the battle of Dharmatt and
then defated a force led by Dara in the battle of Samugarh. Thereafter, he
entered Agra and crowned himself with the title of Alamgir ( Conqueror of
the World).
• The mughal empire stretched from Kashmir in the north to Jinji in South,
from the Hindukush in the west to Chittagong in the east.
Aurangazeb (1658-1707)
• His empire was established in 21 provinces
• Aurangazeb was one of the ablest kings of the Mughal.
• He assumed the title Alamgir, World Conqueror.
• In his first ten years of reign, his military campaigns were a great success.
• But in the latter part of his reign, he faced serious difficulties.
• The Jats and Satnamis and also the Sikhs revolted against him due to his
harsh religious policy.
• The Deccan policy of the Mughals started from the reign of Akbar.
• Aurangazeb, as governor of Deccan, followed a belligerent Deccan policy.
Aurangazeb (1658-1707)
• First tenure (1636-1644) and 2
nd tenure (1653-1658) as governor of
Deccan. Aurengzeb built an effective Revenue system there (Murshid
Kuli Khan was his dewan there).
• He concentrated on the northwest frontier in his first 25 years as the
Mughal emperor
• In the same time, Sivaji, the Maratha Ruler carved an an independent
Maratha kingdom in the territories of north and south Konkan.
• Aurangazeb decided to invade Bijapur in 1686 and Golkonda in 1687 to
hold the spread of the Marathas.
Aurangazeb (1658-1707)
• He defeated Sikandar Shah of Bijapur and seized his kingdom.
• He proceeded against Golkonda and eliminated the Kutb Shahi
dynasty.
• The destruction of the Deccan kingdoms was a political blunder by
Aurangazeb.
• The barrier between the Mughals and the Marathas was removed and
there ensued a direct confrontation between them.
• He caused serious rift in the Mughal- Rajput alliance by his policy of
annexation of marwar in 1639 after the death of Raja Jaswant Singh.
Religious Policy
• His ideal was to transform India into an Islamic state.
• He created a separate department to enforce moral codes under a
high-powered officer called Muhtasib.
• Drinking was prohibited. Cultivation and use of bhang and other drugs
were banned
• Aurangazeb forbade music in the Mughal court
• He discontinued the practice of Jarokhadarshan
• He also discontinued the celebration of Dasarah and royal astronomers
and astrologers were also dismissed from service
Religious Policy
• When he began a policy of destroying Hindu temples.
• The celebrated temples at Mathura and Benares were reduced to
ruins.
• In 1679, he reimposed jiziya and pilgrim tax.
• The celebration of Muharram was stopped
• His invasions against the Deccan sultanates were partly due to his
hatred of the Shia faith
• He was also against the Sikhs and he executed the ninth Sikh Guru
Tej Bahadur.
Religious Policy
• In 1675, he ordered the arrest and execution of ninth sikh guru,
Guru Tegh Bahadur.
• Guru Tegh Bahadur was beheaded in December 1675 A.D. in
Chandini Chowk. The Gurudwara Sheeshganj marks the site of his
martyrdom. The tenth Guru Govind Singh organized the Sikhs into a
strong military power against the Mughal Empire. Guru Govind
Singhhad to undergo great hardships and lost the life of all his four
sons at the hands of Mughals, and flees from one place to another.
Religious Policy
• His religious policy was responsible for turning the Rajputs, the
Marathas and Sikhs into the enemies of Mughal Empire
• It had also resulted in the rebellions of the Jats of Mathura and the
Satnamis of Mewar.
• He had the highest number of Hindu Mansabdars.
• Aurangzeb gave his sister Jahan Ara the title Sahibat-uz-Zamani.
• Therefore, Aurangazeb was held responsible for the decline of the
Mughal Empire.
Development of Literature during
Aurangzeb’s Reign
• He was a great scholar of Islamic theology and jurisprudence. He
appointed a board of Ulema to compile authoritative passages from
the standard of Hanafi Fiqh (Fatawa-ul- Alamgiri) for the guidance
of the qazis known as ‘Fatawat-i- Alamgiri’ which was completed in
AD 1672.
• Important historical woks- Mutakhab-ul-Lubab by Khafi Khan;
Alamgir Namah by Mirza Muhammad Kazim; Masir-i- Alamgiri by
Muhammad Saqi; Fatuhat-i- Alamgiri by Iswar Das.
Personality and Character
• Aurangazeb was an orthodox Sunni Muslim.
• In his private life, Aurangazeb was diligent and disciplined
• He was very simple in food and dress.
• He earned money for his personal expenses by copying Quran and
selling those copies.
• He did not consume wine.
• He was proficient in Arabic and Persian languages.
• He was devoted to his religion and conducted prayers five times a
day.
Personality and Character
• He strictly observed the Ramzan fasting.
• He misunderstood the true nature of the Maratha movement and
provoked them.
• Also, he failed to solve the Maratha problem and left an open sore.
• His policy towards Shia Deccan Sultanates also proved to be wrong.
• His antagonistic policies towards non-Muslims did not help him to
rally the Muslims to his side and strengthened political enemies of
the Mughal Empire.
Personality and Character
• Aurangzeb’s personal life was marked by simplicity. He had the
reputation of being orthodox, God fearing Muslim. In a course of
time, he began to be regarded as a zinda pir, or “a living saint.”
• Apart from being an orthodox Muslim, Aurangzeb was also a ruler.
He could hardly forget the political reality that the overwhelming
population of India was Hindu, and that they were deeply attached
to their faith.
Causes for the Downfall of the Mughals
• The Mughal Empire declined rapidly after the death of Aurangazeb.
(Buried near Daultabad near Majar of Sheikh-Jam-ul-hq)
• Taking this advantage, in 1739, Nadir Shah imprisoned the Mughal
Emperor and looted Delhi.
• The religious and Deccan policies of Aurangazeb contributed to its
decline.
• The weak successors and demoralization of the Mughal army were also
the reasons for the decline.
Causes for the Downfall of the Mughals
• The financial difficulties due to continuous wars led to the decline.
• The neglect of the sea power by the Mughals was felt when the
Europeans began to settle in India.
• Further, the invasions of Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali
weakened the Mughal state.

Architecture
and Paintings
By Dr Vipan Goyal

of several monuments, he was more fond of gardens. Babur
issued instructions that gardens and orchards be laid out in all
large cities in his domains.
 Built two mosque: one at kabulibagh in Panipat and other in
Sambhal in Rohilkhand.
Mughal Architecture
• Humayun
 Humayun laid the foundation of the city Din Panah at
Delhi.
 Built jamali mosque and mosque of Isa Khan at Delhi.
 Humayun’s tomb is called the proto type of Taj Mahal.
It has a double dome of marble, while the central
dome is octagonal.
 The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's wife and
chief consort, Empress Hamida Banu Begum in 1565-
72, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son,
Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her.
 The garden and the gateway are to be found in all
Mughal-style tombs.
Mughal Architecture
• Akbar
 Building’s built by Akbar are Agra Fort in red sandstone
(1565), Lahore Palace (1572), Fatehpur Sikri’ (city of
victory), Buland Darwaza and Allahabad Fort (1583).
 The architecture at Fatehpur Sikri is an excellent
blending of Persian, Central Asian and various Indian
(Bengal and Gujarat) styles . It is also known as Epic
poem in red sandstone.
 Indian tradition includes deep eaves, balconies and
Kiosks. Central Asian Style is evident in the use of
glazed blue tiles. Two unusual buildings at Fatehpur
Sikri are Panch Mahal & Diwan-i-Khas.
Mughal Architecture
• Akbar
 The Panch Mahal has the plan of Buddhist Vihara. The
Jodhabai’s Palace, Diwan-i-Aam, Diwan-i-Khas are
Indian in their plan.
 Buland Darwaja of approx 53m high (built after Gujarat
victory), formed the main entrance to Fatehpur Sikri. It
is built in the Iranian style of half dome portal.
 Salim Chisti’s tomb (redone in Marble by Jahangir is the
first Mughal building in Pure marble), palaces of Birbal,
Anup Talao, Mariyam Mahal are also inside the
Fatehpur Sikri.
Mughal Architecture
• Akbar
 He built the Jahangiri Mahal in Agra fort
according to Hindu design based on Man
Mandir.
 Haroon Minar—Tower built by Akbar in
memory of his elephant (Haroon).
 He also began to build his own tomb at
Sikandara which, was later completed by
Jahangir.
 Built the temple of Govindadeva at
Vrindavan.
Mughal Architecture
• Jahangir
 Jahangir was a patron of painting rather than architecture.
 The most well known building of his reign was the mausoleoum he built
for his father at Sikandara, near Agra.
 Jahangir’s buildings at Agra fort were later pulled down by Shah Jahan.
 Beneath the viewing balcony (jharoka) from which he gave darshan to
the public, he had installed life-size marble statues of the defeated Rana
of Mewar, Amar Singh and his son, Karan, much as Akbar had placed
statues of the Rajput heroes Jaimal and Fatha outside Agra Palace.
Mughal Architecture
• Jahangir
 Jahangir was immensely interested in gardens; the
most famous of those associated with him being
in Srinagar.
 His queen, Nur Jahan’s most well known
architectural project is the white marble
mausoleum she built near Agra for her father,
Itimad-ud-daula. It is a magnificently carved
monument, inlaid with semi-precious stones in
marble, a technique known as pietra dura.
 The style of architecture used by both Jahangir
and Shahjahan is known as Indo Persian.
Mughal Architecture
• Jahangir
 Important features of this style are
Curved lines, Bulbous dome, foliated
arches vigorous use of marble instead
of red sand stone and use of pietre dura
for decorative purposes.
 He built Moti Masjid in Lahore and his
own mausoleum at Shahdara (Lahore).
 He also built Shalimar Bagh at Srinagar.
Mughal Architecture
• Shah Jahan
 Shah Jahan commissioned the Jami Mosque within
the dargah of the Sufi Saint Muinuddin Chisthi at
Ajmer and paid regular homage at the shrine till the
end of his reign.
 Mosque building activity reached its climax in Taj
Mahal.
 Some of the important buildings built by
Shahajahan at Agra are Moti Masjid in Agra, Khaas
Mahal, Musamman Bun (Jasmine Palace where he
spent his last years in captivity) and Sheesh Mahal
with mosaic glasses on walls and ceilings.
Mughal Architecture
• Shah Jahan
 Many stone buildings were destroyed by him and
replaced by marble.
 He laid the foundations of Shahjahanabad in 1637
where he built the Red Fort and Taqt-i-taus
(Peacock throne).
 Peacock throne was built by Bebadal khan on which
Amir Khusrau’s couplet “If there is a paradise on
earth, it is here”, inscribed on it.
 In 1648 the court, army and household moved from
Agra to the newly completed imperial capital
Shahajahanabad.
Mughal Architecture
• Shah Jahan
 It was a new addition to the old residential city of Delhi, with the Red
Fort.
 Jama Masjid at Agra was built by his daughter JahanAra.
 Shah Jahan’s new city was appropriate to a more formal vision of a
grand monarchy.
 Most richly ornamented building in Red Fort was the Diwan-i-Khas or
Rang Mahal. He laid the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore. ( kashmir
shalimar bagh was by jahangir)
Mughal Architecture
• Shah Jahan
 Shahjahan built Nahar-i-Fuiz. He built his father’s
mausoleum at Lahore, and ordered fresh
construction at the forts of Lahore and Agra.
 Also built Mussaman Burz ( or Shah Burz) at Agra (
where he spent his last 8 years in captivity)
 Shah Jahan too was fond of gardens and ordered a
number of them to be laid, the most famous of
them being the Shalimar Garden in lahore, but the
monument by which he is best known is the Taj
Mahal built in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz
Mahal.
About Tajmahal
• Constructed for his wife Arjumand Bano begum
better known as Mumtaz Mahal.
• It was constructed in 1631-1653 by a workforce of
22000.
• Main artist of Taj Mahal was Ustad Ahmed Lahori
and got the title of Nadir-uj-asar from Shah Jahan.
Architectural design by Ustad Isa and Isa Muhammad
Effendi. Main dome was designed by Ismail Khan.
Amanat khan was the chief calligrapher.
• ‘Mughal architecture reached its zenith under Shah
Jahan.
Mughal Architecture
• Aurangzeb
 Aurangzeb is said to have repaired more
mosques than any other Mughal Emperor.
 He also ordered the construction of the
Moti Mosque inside Shahjahanabad fort in
Delhi.
 He commissioned the Badshahi Mosque at
Lahore, which is the largest mosque in the
sub-continent.
Mughal Architecture
• Aurangzeb
 Aurangzeb destroyed several Hindu temples like the Keshava Rai
temple built by Raja Bir Singh in Mathura, the Vishwanath temple
constructed by Raja Man Singh in Banaras, besides several others in
Bihar, Udaipur, Jodhpur and other centres in Rajasthan.
Mughal Architecture
• Aurangzeb
 Only monument associated with Aurangzeb
is Bibi ka Makbara which is the tomb of his
wife Rabbia-ud-daura in Aurangabad.
 (Actually it was built by his son Azam Shah)
 A number of magnificent palaces built by
Hindu princes in medieval’ times have
survived. Among the most exceptional is the
palace within Gwalior fort, built by Maharaja
Man Singh in the early sixteenth century,
and known as the Man Mandir.
The Concept of Charbagh
• One of the greatest early deeds of Mughals
is that they brought the
Persian Charbagh style to India.
• Charbagh is a Persian-style garden layout,
in which the main building is put at the
centre of a quadrilateral garden, divided by
walkways or flowing water into four smaller
parts.
• Humayun’s tomb and Taj Mahal in
India are the most famous examples of this
style. In the Charbagh at the Taj Mahal,
each of the four parts contains sixteen
flower beds.
The Concept of Charbagh
• Ram Bagh was the oldest Mughal Garden in India, originally built
by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1528, in Charbagh style. It located
about five kilometers northeast of the Taj Mahal in Agra, India.
Babur was temporarily buried there before being interred in Kabul.
• Another typical example of the Charbagh style is the mausoleum
and its garden of I’timād-ud-Daulah (1628), father of Nur Jahan,
located in Agra. The tomb, embellished with delicate inlaid works
using colored stones despite a white house of white marble wholly,
is a jewel of Mughal architecture.
The Concept of Charbagh
• When Humayun tumbled out of this world silently under the
influence of opium, his widow made the first full-blown piece of
Mughal architecture, the Humayun’s Tomb in Charbagh style in
Delhi.
• The Humayun’s tomb is the first garden-tomb in India.
Mughal Painting
• The Mughals introduced new themes depicting the conn,
battle scenes and the chase and added new colours
(Peacock blue and Indian red).
• The Mughal pictures were small in size, and hence are
known as ‘miniature paintings’.
• Though the Mughal art absorbed the Indian atmosphere, it
neither represented the Indian emotions, nor the scenes
from the daily life of the Indian. It was mostly courtly and
aristocratic.
• A keen appreciation of nature was another characteristic of
the Mughal School.
• Remarkable excellence achieved by the Mughal school in
portrait-painting.
Mughal Painting
• Humayun
 The Mughal School of painting began with Humayun, who became
familar with Persian art during his exile at the Safavid court. The ruler,
Shah Tahmasp was a great patron of painting, but gradually turned
orthodox. Hence, many of his painters joined Humayun on his return
journey to Hindustan.
 The most renowned among them were Mir Sayyid Ali. Abdus Samad,
Mir Musavvir’and Dost Muhammad. Artists from Iran also made their
way to Mughal India. Some were brought to the Mughal court, as in
the case of Mir Sayyid Ali and Abdus Samad, who were made to
accompany Emperror Humayun to Delhi.
Mughal Painting
• Akbar
 Akbar was the real founder of the Mughal School of miniature Paintings. The two most
celebrated works accomplished during the times of Akbar was Tuti-nama and Hamza
Nama.
 Akbar commissioned the illustrations of several literary and religious texts. Akbar gave
employment to many artists.
 A hundred and fifty or so are known since the illustrations in the manuscripts produced
during Akbar’s reign bear the names of the artists.
 The chief painters were Mir Sayyid Ali, Abd-al-Samad and Baswan, a Hindu.
 Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd-al-Samad drilled the craftsmen in all the technical details of
Persian miniatures.
 Many Indians such Baswan, Miskina and Daswant attained great positions as court
artists.
Mughal Painting
• Akbar
 Early projects of Akbar’s reign include the Hamza nama, the story of Amir Hamza, an
uncle of Prophet Muhammad, who tried to convert the world to Islam.
 The manuscript comprised of fourteen volumes, each having one hundred illustrations.
 At least fifty painters are believed to have worked on the project.
 Among the major painters at Akbar’s court was Daswanth who illustrated the
Razamanama (the Persian translation of the Mahabharata).
 After the Razamnama, Akbar’s interest shifted to historical works.
 Among the historical projects now sanctioned were the Tarikh-i-Alfi (a history of the first
thousand years of Islam) and the Timur Nanza an illustrated account of the life of Timur.
Mughal Painting
• Tuti-Nama : seems to be the first work of the Mughal School. TutiNama literally means the “Tales of a Parrot”.
• It is an illustrated compilation of 52 stories in 250 miniature
paintings.
• The work was commissioned by Akbar.
• The themes and stories are derived from the 12th century Sanskrit
anthology titled Śukasaptati or “Seventy Tales of Parrot”. The parrot
tells the 52 stories in the consecutive 52 nights and in these stories
he teaches some moral stories to his owner. The work was
completed in a span of five years under Mir Sayyid Ali and Abdus
Samad.
• The text was written by Nakhshabi, an ethnic Persian physician and a
Sufi saint who had migrated to Badayun. It was wrote in Persian.
Mughal Painting
• Hamza-nama : It contains the illustrations on cloth,
originally consisting of 1400 leaves in seventeen volumes.
Each leaf measured about 27″x20″. These paintings were
based upon a Persian Hamzanama or Dastan-e-Amir
Hamza.
• Amir Hamza was the uncle of the prophet of Islam.
• These illustrations went beyond the story-telling and
brought into existence some dazzling images, glowing with
jewel-like colours.
• The initial paintings show the Persian style with Brilliant
red, blue and green colours predominating. The later works
show Indian tones.
Mughal Painting
 Jahangir
• Under Jahangir, the Mughal school paintings acquired greater
charm, refinement and dignity.
• The emperor Jahangir had a great fascination for nature and
took delight in the portraiture of birds, animals and flowers.
• The best example of this period is the portrait of Jahangir
himself, who is shown holding a picture of the Virgin Mary in
his right hand.
• Some other illustrated manuscripts of Jahangir’s time are
animal fable book titled Ayar-i-Danish, Anwar-i-sunavli. Most
of the paintings created during the time of Jahangir depict
the durbar scenes, portraits, bird, animal and flower studies.
• Aqa Riza, Abul Hasan, Mansur, Bishan Das, Manohar,
Goverdhan, Balchand, Daulat, Mukhlis, Bhim and Inayat were
the famous painters in the court of Jahangir.
• Ustad Mansur
• Ustad Mansur was a court artist of Jahangir, who specialised in
depicting plants and animals. He is best known for two
paintings one of which was a siberian crane and another was of
a Bengal Florican. He is also remembered for a famous painting
on Dodo, the now extinct Bird.
• Bishandas
Out of the above mentioned painters, Bishandas was praised
by the emperor as “unrivalled in the art of portraiture”.
• In 1613, Bishandas was sent on a diplomatic mission to Persia,
to paint the Shah’s portrait.
• He remained there for seven years and returned happily with
an elephant as gift.

The Theory of
Evolution
By Dr Vipan Goyal

The Theory of Evolution
• In science, the term “Theory” does not express doubt.
• In science, the term theory is used to represent ideas and
explanations that have been confirmed through tests and
observations
• The theory of evolution remains one of the most useful theories in
biology because it explains many questions and observations.
Oparin's Modern Theory
• (a) Oparin (1924) proposed that “life could have originated from non-living
organic molecules.”
• (b) He believed in Biochemical origin of life. Haldane (1929) also stated
similar views. Oparin greatly expanded his ideas and presented them as a
book “The origin of life” in 1936.
• (c) According to this theory, the Earth originated about 4,500 million years
ago. When the earth was cooling down, it had a reduced atmosphere. In
this primitive atmosphere nitrogen, hydrogen, ammonia, methane, carbon
mono-oxide and water were present.
• Energy was available in the form of electric discharges by lightening and
ultraviolet rays.
• As soon as the earth crust was formed, it was very much folded. Torrential
rains poured over the earth for centuries and were deposited in deep
places.
• (d) Miller's Experiment: An American scientist (Biologist) Stanley Miller
(1953) performed an experiment under support Oparin's theory of origin
of life.
• (e) Miller took a flask and filled it with methane, ammonia and hydrogen
in proportion of 2:1:2 respectively at 0°C.
• This proportion of gases probably existed in the environment at time of origin of
life.
• This flask was connected with a smaller flask, that was filled with water, with the
help of glass tubes.
• In the bigger flask, two electrodes of tungsten were fitted. Then a current of
60,000 volts was passes, through gases containing bigger flask for seven days.
• At the end of seven days, when the vapours condensed, a red substance was found
in the U-tube.
• When this red substance was analyzed, it was found to contain amino acids,
Glycine and nitrogenous bases which are found in the nucleus of a cell.

Lamarck’s Theory of Acquired
Characteristics
• Some thought that you would gain or lose features if you overused
or didn’t use them, and you could pass these new traits onto your
offspring.
• This was known as the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics
• Book: Philosphic Zoologique
• A lizard that didn’t use it legs would eventually not have legs and its
offspring wouldn’t have legs
• A giraffe stretched its neck to reach higher leaves, and this
stretched neck would be a trait inherited by its offspring.
• Lamarck’s Theory was eventually discarded – PROVEN TO BE
WRONG!
• Why?
• Logically it doesn’t work. Imagine if you were in a car accident and
had a leg amputed. This does not mean that your children will only
have one leg. Features gained during life are not passed on to
children.
Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by Natural
Selection
• Darwin was a naturalist who observed many species. He is famous for his
trips to the Galapagos Islands, his observations of the finches (and other
animals) and the book he wrote: “The Origin of Species:
1. Variation exists among individuals in a species.
2. Individuals of species will compete for resources (food and space)
3. Some competition would lead to the death of some individuals while
others would survive
4. Individuals that had advantageous variations are more likely to
survive and reproduce.
Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by Natural
Selection
• In this process he describes came to be known
as Natural Selection. The favorable variations are
called Adaptations
• Darwin’s Finches: Darwin noted that all the finches
on the Galapagos island looked about the same
except for the shape of their beak.
• His observations lead to the conclusion that all the
finches were descendants of the same original
population. The shape of the beaks were
adaptations for eating a particular type of food (Ex.
long beaks were used for eating insects, short for
seeds)
Evidence of Evolution
• 1. Fossil Evidence
 If today’s species came from ancient species, the we should be able to
find remains of those species that no longer exist.
 We have tons of fossils of creatures that no longer exist but bear
striking resemblance to creatures that do exist today.
 Carbon dating–gives an age of a sample based on the amount of
radioactive carbon is in a sample.
Evidence of Evolution
• 2. Evidence from Living Organism
 Homologous Structures–structures that are embryologically similar,
but have different functions, the wing of a bird and the forearm of a
human
 Vestigial Organs–seemingly functionless parts, snakes have tiny pelvic
and limb bones, humans have a tail bone, pinna of the ear, nictating
membrane, vermiform appendix,

Biology
The study of living beings is called biology.
• Father of biology – Aristotle
• Father of botany – Theophrashtus
• Father of zoology – Aristotle
What is living organisms?
Growth – The increase in number of cells or mass is called growth.
Reproduction- Living organisms produce young ones of the same kind
Metabolism – Chemical reaction occurring inside a living cell.
Development – Maturity in the body
Types of metabolism reactions
• Anabolism – The process of formation of larger molecules from
smaller molecules are called anabolism. Ex: Photosynthesis
• Catabolism – The process of breaking down of larger molecules into
smaller with the release of energy. Ex: Respiration
• In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with
Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all
plants and animals respectively
 Book: Systema Nature
Limitations
• Limitations of two kingdom classification:
 Not covered Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes.
 Not covered unicellular and multicellular organisms.
 Not covered photosynthetic and non photosynthetic.
• A new classification came into existence by R.H. whittaker based on
cell structure, thallus structure, thallus organization, mode of
nutrition, reproduction and phylogenetic relationship (based on
evolutionary relationship).
• After 5 kingdom classifications there is another type of classification
was given by Carl Woese who gave 6 kingdom classification. He
separated prokaryotes into Eubacteria and Archaebacteria.
5 kingdom classification by R.H. Whittaker
5 kingdom classification by R.H. Whittaker
• Monera
 Prokaryotic, unicellular without nucleus.
 e.g. Bacteria, Blue Green Algae.
• Protista
 Eukaryotic, unicellular with nucleus.
 Mainly found in aquatic.
 e.g. Diatoms, Algae and Protozoa.
5 kingdom classification by R.H. Whittaker
• Fungi
 Multicellular, found on dead and decaying matter.
 e.g. Mushroom : edible
• Taxonomy classification : (Father of Taxonomy is Linneaus)
• Trick: Khoob Padenge Class OF GS
• Kingdom---Phylum---Class---Order---Family---Genus---Species

Binomial Nomenclature
• In 1730s – Swedish botanist – Carlous Linnaeus – developed two word naming system.
• In binomial nomenclature, each species is assigned a 2 part scientific name, written in
italic.
• The First word begins with capital letter = Genus (group of similar species) to which
organism belongs.
• The Second word is lowercased = unique to each species.
• Genus comprises a group of related species which has more characters in common in
comparison to species of other genera.
• We can say that genera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, Lion
(Panthera leo), leopard ( pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with several common features, are
all species of the genus Panthera
• A species is a group of individuals capable of interbreeding and producing
fertile offspring.
• Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics. They are
Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin.
• The first word in a biological name represents the genus while the second
component denotes the specific epithet.
• Book: species planatarum
Description of important or habitat

Monera
• The organisms in this group are
• Prokaryotes == do not have a defined nucleus or organelles {Prokaryotic Cells vs.
Eukaryotic Cells}.
• Unicellular == do any of them show multi-cellular body designs.
• This group includes all Some well-known bacteria include blue-green
algae or cyanobacteria [have cell walls], and mycoplasma [doesn’t possess a Cell
Wall].
• They are the most abundant micro-organisms and live in extreme habitats.
• The mode of nutrition of organisms in this group can be either by synthesizing
their own food (autotrophic) or getting it from the environment (heterotrophic).
• Many of them live in or on other organisms as parasites.
BACTERIA
• Father of Bacteriology is Louis Pasteur.
• Ehrenberg used the word bacteria.
• Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that thrive in diverse
environments.
• These organisms can live in soil, the ocean and inside the human gut.
Humans' relationship with bacteria is complex.
• Sometimes bacteria lend us a helping hand, such as by curdling milk into
yogurt or helping with our digestion.
• Bacteria are prokaryotes . Hence they do not have a well defined nucleus
and have a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan, a protein sugar molecule.
BACTERIA
• Their genetic material , which consists of circular and doublestranded DNA , floats freely in the cytoplasm and is not
membranebound.
• The region in the cytoplasm , where the genetic material floats is
known as nucleoid.
• Louis Pasteur discovered the Rabies(hydrophobia) bacteria. He also
discovered the process of Pasteurization of milk.
• Low temp. 62.8 degree Celsius for 30 min
• High temp 71.7 degree Celsius for 15 seconds.
BACTERIA
• Robert Koch discovered tuberculosis bacteria.
• Vaccine is BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin)
• The common structural forms are:-
 Spherical or ovoid (Coccus) Ex: Streptococcus thermophillus
 Rod shaped or cylindrical (Bacillus) Ex: Bacillus bulgaricus
 Spiral or screw (Spirillum) Ex: Borrelia burgdorferi
 Comma shaped (Vibrio) Ex: Vibrio Cholera

BACTERIA
• Nitrogen Fixation bacteria
• Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Clostridium – living free in the soil and fix
nitrogen
• Anabena and Nostoc fix atmospheric nitrogen.
• Rhizobium in the roots of legume plants examples Beans
• E.coli (Escherichia coli) bacteria in large intestine helps in the formation of
Vit K
• Lactobacillus helps in formation of milk. ( lactose to lactic acid )
• Mycococcus in Tobacco plants
• Bacillus Megatherium present in Tea plants for fragnance.
Archaebacteria
• Most of them are autotrophs and only a few photosynthesize.
• They derive their energy for metabolic activities, from the oxidation of chemical energy
sources like reduced gases – Ammonia, methane or hydrogen sulphide.
• In the presence of these chemicals it can manufacture their own amino acids acid
proteins.
• These bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats such as
extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles) and marshy areas
(methanogens) .
• Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria in having a different cell wall structure and
this feature is responsible for their survival in extreme conditions.
• Methanogens are present in the gut of several ruminant animals such as cows and
buffaloes and they are responsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the
dung of these animals.
Eubacteria
• There are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true bacteria’.
• They are characterized by the presence of a rigid cell wall,
and if motile, a flagellum.
Kingdom PROTISTA
• This group includes many kinds of unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as unicellular
algae, protozoans and unicellular fungi.
• Some of these organisms use appendages i.e. hair like structure cilia like in
paramecium or whip-like flagellum e.g euglena.
• Their mode of nutrition can be autotrophic (Unicellular algae, diatoms) or
heterotrophic/protozoans. .
Examples: Unicellular algae, chlorella, Euglena, Trypanosoma (causes sleeping
sickness),Amoeba, Plasmodium, Paramecium, Chlamydomonas etc.
• Brown algae – The Phaeophyta
• Red algae – The Rhodophyta
• Green algae – The Chlorophyta
• Their mode of nutrition can
be autotrophic or heterotrophic.
• Members of Protista are primarily
aquatic.
• Some have flagella or cilia that helps in
movement.
• Protists,reproduce asexually and sexually
by a process involving cell fusion and
zygote formation.
Chrysophytes
• This group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids).
• Most of them are photosynthetic.
• Diatoms are the chief ‘producers’ in the oceans.
• They are found in fresh water as well as in marine
environments.
• They are microscopic and float passively in water currents
(plankton).
• In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells.
• The walls are embedded with silica and thus the walls are
indestructible.
• Thus, diatoms have left behind large amount of cell wall
deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over billions of
years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’.
• Dinoflagellates
• Very often, red dinoflagellates (Example: Gonyaulax) undergo such rapid
multiplication that they make the sea appear red (red tides).
• Euglenoids
• Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein rich layer called pellicle which makes
their body flexible.
• Though they are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when deprived of
sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by predating on other smaller organisms.
• Slime Moulds
• Slime moulds are saprophytic protists.
• Under suitable conditions, they form an aggregation called plasmodium which
may grow and spread over several feet.
• During unfavorable conditions, the plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting
bodies bearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls.
• They are extremely resistant and survive for many years, even under adverse
conditions. The spores are dispersed by air currents.
EUTROPHICATION
• Nitrates and phosphates are nutrients
that plants need to grow.
• In excessive amounts, however,
nutrients cause a type of pollution
called Eutrophication.
• Eutrophication stimulates an
explosive growth of algae (algal
blooms) that depletes the water of
oxygen when the the algae die and
are eaten by bacteria.
FUNGI
• They are eukaryotic organisms, do not contain chlorophyll. It is a non-photosynthetic
heterotrophs. It releases digestive enzymes to break down organic material or their host.
They store energy as glycogen.
• Most are saprobes - live on other dead organisms.
• Most are multicellular, but some unicellular like yeast.
• Those that depend on living plants and animals are called parasites.
• Some fungal species live in permanent mutually dependent relationships with bluegreen
algae (or cyanobacteria). Such relationships are called symbiotic. These symbiobic life
forms are called lichens. They can also live as symbionts in association with roots of higher
plants as mycorrhiza.
• Fungi + Bluegreen algae (Cyanobacteria) == Lichens.
• They are non-motile, lacks true roots, stems and leaves. The cell wall are made of chitin (a
complex polysaccharide).
FUNGI
• The body of fungus made of tiny filaments or tubes called hyphae.
• Hyphal networks are called mycelium. Ex: mushroom (Agaricus)
• The classification did not differentiate between the heterotrophic group –
fungi, and the autotrophic green plants, though they also showed a
characteristic difference in their walls composition – the fungi had chitin in
their walls while the green plants had a cellulosic cell wall.
• When such characteristics were considered, the fungi were placed in a
separate kingdom – Kingdom Fungi. All prokaryotic organisms were
grouped together under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic
organisms were placed in Kingdom Protista.
• When your bread develops a mould or your orange rots it is because of
fungi.
• The common mushroom you eat and toadstools are also fungi.
• White spots seen on mustard leaves are due to a parasitic fungus.
• Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to make bread and beer.
• Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat rustcausing Puccinia is an important example.
• Some are the source of antibiotics, e.g., Penicillium.
FUNGI
• Penicillin- discovered by Alexander Fleming (1st antibiotic from Penicillium
Notatum)
• Aspergillus helps in the formation of cheese. (paneer)
• Ergot obtained from Claviceps Purpurea. It grows on Rye and other plants.
• It causes psychological problems.
• LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)
• Obtained from Claviceps.
• It causes hallucinations.
Virus
• It can survive only inside another living organism, animal or plant. It is a
connecting link between living and non-living things.
• Virus has genetic material, either deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) OR ribonucleic
acid (RNA). Unlike living cells, viruses can have either DNA or RNA, but not both.
• In virus, a protein coat called a capsid surrounds the nucleic acid. This coat serves
to protect the nucleic acid and aid in its transmission between host cells.
• Some viruses have a third structure that surrounds the capsid. This is called the
envelope and is composed of a bilipid layer and glycoproteins.
• Envelope protects the virus from immune system when host secretes anti- virus
substances called interferons.
Virus
• Virus was discovered
by Ivanovsky.
• Tobacco Mosaic Virus
was the first virus
discovered.
• Capsid- protein shell
of virus
Bacteriophage: Virus which infect the bacteria.
PRIONS
• In modern medicine certain infectious
neurological diseases were found to be
transmitted by an agent consisting of
abnormally folded protein.
• The agent was similar in size to viruses.
These agents were called prions.
• The most notable diseases caused by
prions are bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) commonly called
mad cow disease in cattle and its
analogous variant Cr– Jacob disease (CJD)
in humans.
• Prions, lack DNA, RNA the nucleic acid
found in viruses.
VIROIDS
• In 1971, T.O. Diener discovered a new
infectious agent mainly a plant
pathogens that was smaller than
viruses and caused potato spindle
tuber disease.
• It was found to be a free RNA;
• it lacked the protein coat that is found
in viruses, hence the name viroid.
• The RNA of the viroid was of low
molecular weight.
Virion
• Extracellular, which spread the disease. But virus can be found
inside or outside the cell.

STUDY OF CELL
• Cell is a basic structural and functional unit of life. The word cell
was coined by Robert hook (Book- Micrographia) and discovered
by Anton van leuwenhoek.
• Smallest cell – Mycoplasma gallisepticum (PPLO- Pleuro Pneumonia
Like Organisms; also known as Jokers of the living world)
• Smallest cell in human body is RBC
• Longest cell – Neuron
• Biggest cell – Egg of ostrich
STUDY OF CELL
• Cell theory was given by Schliden and Schwann in 1838.
• And it states that Each organism is made up of cell and each cell
arises from its pre-existing cell.
• Rudolf Virchow coined the term Omnis Cellula-e-Cellula i.e. New
cell arises from pre existing cell
Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes
Plant vs. Animal Cell
Plant vs. Animal Cell
Parts of Cell
• Cell wall :
 Made up of cell wall in plants. Cell wall is absent in animals.
 Provides shape and rigidity to cell.
 In plants, it is made up of cellulose.
• Cell membrane :
 Also known as Plasma Membrane.
 Made up of Phospholipids.
 It regulates the movement of molecules inside and outside the
cell.
Parts of Cell
• Protoplasm :
 Living part of the cell.
 The whole fluid inside the cell.
• Composition :
 oxygen- 76 percent
 carbon – 10.5 percent
 hydrogen- 10 percent
 nitrogen- 2.5 percent
Parts of Cell
• Protoplasm
 Ratio Inorganic : Organic = 81 : 19
 Protoplasm discovered by Purkinje
 Huxley called protoplasm is the basis of life.
• Two types :
 Cytoplasm : found inside the cell and outside the nuclear
membrane
 Nucleoplasm : found inside the nucleus
Parts of Cell
• MITOCHONDRIA
 It is called the power house of the cell due to
its production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate),
 ATP on breaking down converts into ADP and
energy.
 It has double membrane and has enzymes for
cellular respiration.
 ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is called energy
currency of the cell.
 Mitochondria contain DNA.
Parts of Cell
• PLASTIDS
 It is a double-membrane
organelles.
 They are of different colours.
 Some of them contain green
pigment called chlorophyll.
Green coloured plastids are
called chloroplasts. They provide
green colour to the leaves.
Parts of Cell
• Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis in plants.
• Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange
pigments in addition to chlorophyll.
• Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two
types of plastids – chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and
leucoplasts (white or colourless plastids).
• Leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials
such as starch, oils and protein granules are stored.
• The internal organization of the plastids consists of
numerous membrane layers embedded in a material
called the stroma.
Parts of Cell
• Plastids are similar to mitochondria in external structure. Like the
mitochondria, plastids also have their own dna and ribosomes.
• Plastid as Storage
 Amyloplast Stores starch
 Elaioplast Stores oil/ fat
 Proteinoplast Stores proteins
Plastid Food
Lycopene Tomato
B-Carotene carrot
ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM
• It is of two types:-
 Smooth endoplasmic reticulum- It
has no ribosomes, that is why
smooth and a site for fats or lipid
production.
 Rough endoplasmic reticulum – It
has ribosomes, and thus a site for
production of proteins.
• In the liver cells of the group of animals
called vertebrates, SER plays a crucial
role in detoxifying many poisons and
drugs
Golgi Apparatus or Golgi Complex
• The golgi apparatus consists of a
system of membrane-bound
vesicles arranged approximately
parallel to each other in stacks
called cisterns.
• These membranes often have
connections with the membranes
of ER and therefore constitute
another portion of a complex
cellular membrane system.
• The material synthesized near the
ER is packaged and dispatched to
various targets inside and outside
the cell through the golgi
apparatus.
Golgi Apparatus or Golgi Complex
• Its functions include the storage, modification and packaging of
products in vesicles.
• In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in
the golgi apparatus.
• The golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of lysosomes.
Parts of Cell
• Ribosomes:
 Made up of RNA.
 It takes part in Protein Synthesis.
 Also called Protein factory of the cell.
• Types of ribosomes
• (1) 70S ribosomes : Found in prokaryotes,
mitochondria and plastid of eukaryotes.
• (2) 80S ribosomes : Found in cytoplasm of eukaryotes.
• In 70S and 80S ribosomes, 50S and 30S, 60S and 40S
are larger and smaller subunits respectively. Larger
subunits is dome shaped and attached to ER by
glycoproteins called “ribophorins”.
Parts of Cell
• Lysosomes
 These are called suicidal organelles.
They have hydrolytic enzymes which
can digest the cell.
 Lysosomes are able to do this because
they contain powerful digestive
enzymes capable of breaking down all
organic material.
 It helps in intracellular digestion. And
this process is called Autophagy.
Nucleus
• It is called brain of the cell.
• It has DNA which controls all the
activities of the cell.
• Nucleus is separated from the
cytoplasm by a double layered
membrane called the nuclear
membrane.
• Spherical body in the nucleus is called
the nucleolus.
• In addition, nucleus contains threadlike structures called chromosomes.
• They carry genes and help in
inheritance or transfer of characters
from the parents to the offspring.
• The chromosomes can be seen only
when the cell divides. (Metaphase )
• The nucleus of the bacterial cell is not
well organized like the cells of
multicellular organisms. There is no
nuclear membrane.
Nucleus
• In a cell which is not dividing,
this DNA is present as part of
chromatin material.
• Chromatin material is visible
as entangled mass of thread
like structures. Whenever the
cell is about to divide, the
chromatin material gets
organized into chromosomes.
Nucleoid
• In some organisms like
bacteria, the nuclear
region of the cell may be
poorly defined due to the
absence of a nuclear
membrane.
• Such an undefined nuclear
region containing only
nucleic acids is called a
nucleoid.
Vacuoles
• Empty structure in the cytoplasm is
called vacuole. It could be single and
big as in an onion cell (plant cell).
Cheek cells (animal cells) have smaller
vacuoles.
• Large vacuoles are common in plant
cells. Vacuoles in animal cells are
much smaller.
• Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or
liquid contents.
• The central vacuole of some plant cells
may occupy 50-90% of the cell volume.
Vacuoles
• In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and
provide turgidity [swollen and distended or
congested] and rigidity to the cell.
• Many substances of importance in the life of the
plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These include
amino acids, sugars, various organic acids and some
proteins.
• In single-celled organisms like amoeba, the food
vacuole contains the food items that the amoeba
has consumed.
• In some unicellular organisms, specialized vacuoles
also play important roles in expelling excess water
and some wastes from the cell.
Nucleic Acid
• Discovered by Freidrich Meischer in 1869 during his research on
white blood cells.
• It stores genetic information. Two types : DNA and RNA
• Nucleotides
1. Nitogenous Bases; two types : Purine – Adenine and Guanine;
Pyrimidine- Cytosine and Thymine in DNA but in RNA it is Uracil
2. Sugar- Ribose – pentose sugar
3. Phosphate group
• Nucleoside : Nitrogen Base and Sugar
DNA
• Deoxyribose nucleic acid, a double helicle structure by Watson and
crick.
• DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides.
• Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a
nitrogen base.
• The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T),
guanine (G) and cytosine (C).
• The order of these bases is what determines DNA's instructions, or
genetic code.
RNA (RIBOSE NUCLEIC ACID)
• It has a single helicle structure.
• The nitrogenous sugar is same as that of DNA except uracil in place
of thymine.
• The nitrogenous bases are joined by hydrogen bonding and the
sugar is joined to nitrogenous base using phosphate diester bond.
• DNA forms RNA through the process called transcription and RNA
forms protein through the process called translation.
Question
What enzyme uncoils DNA so it can be replicated or copied?
• Answer – helicase
• A restriction endonucleases is an enzyme that cuts DNA at or near
specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction
sites.
• DNA ligase joins the DNA strands by making bonds between them,
these are called phosphodiester bonds.

Discovery
• The DNA was first recognized and identified by the Swiss biologist,
Johannes Friedrich Miescher
• The double helix structure of a DNA molecule was later discovered
through the experimental data by James Watson and Francis Crick.
• Finally, it was proved that it is responsible for storing the genetic
information of a human being.
DNA
DNA
Among the 3 components of DNA structure, the sugar is the one which
forms the backbone of the DNA molecule. It is also called as deoxyribose.
The nitrogenous bases of the opposite strands form hydrogen bonds,
forming a ladder-like structure.
DNA
DNA
• The two strands of DNA run in
opposite directions.
• The two strands are held together by
the hydrogen bond that is present
between the two.
• The strands are helically twisted,
where each strand forms a righthanded coil and 10 nucleotides make
up a single turn.
DNA
• The pitch of each helix is 3.4 nm. Hence, the distance between two
consecutive base pairs (i.e., hydrogen-bonded bases of the opposite
strands) is 0.34 nm.
DNA
• DNA’s are coiled up forming chromosomes and each chromosome has a
single molecule of DNA in it.
• Overall, human beings have around twenty-three pairs of chromosomes in
them. These chromosomes are found in the cells of the nucleus.
• DNA’s play an important role in the process of cell division.
• Chargaff’s Rule
 Erwin Chargaff, a biochemist, discovered that the number of
nitrogenous bases in the DNA was not present in equal quantities. The
amount of A is equal to T, whereas the amount of C is equal to G.
 A=T; C=G
Functions of DNA
• DNA is the genetic material which carries all the hereditary information which are
coded in the arrangement of its nitrogen bases.
• Genes are the small segments of DNA, consisting mostly of 250 – 2 million base pairs,
depending on the gene.
• A gene code for a polypeptide molecule, where 3 nitrogenous bases stand for one
amino acid.
• Thus, the sequence of a gene can be used to make a polypeptide, which then forms a
protein.
• As every organism contains many genes in their DNA, different types of proteins can be
formed.
• Proteins are the main functional and structural molecules in most of the organisms.
Functions of DNA
• Apart from storing hereditary information, DNA is also involved in:
 Replication process: Transferring the genetic information from one cell
to its daughters and from one generation to the next
 Equal distribution of DNA during the cell division
 Mutations: The changes which occur during the DNA sequences
 Transcription
 Cellular Metabolism
 DNA Fingerprinting
 Gene Therapy.
Why is DNA called a Polynucleotide Molecule?
• The DNA called a polynucleotide because the DNA molecule is
composed of nucleotides -deoxyadenylate (A), deoxyguanylate (G),
deoxycytidylate (C), and deoxythymidylate (thymidylate) (T) which
are combined together to create long chains called a
polynucleotide.
• As per the DNA structure, the DNA consists of two chains of the
polynucleotide, each in the form of a spherical spiral.
DNA Cloning
• DNA cloning is a molecular biology technique
which is used for the creation of exact replicas
or clones of a particular gene or DNA using
genetic engineering techniques.
• The DNA comprising of the target gene(s) is
fragmented using restriction enzymes.
• The cloning is used for making numerous
identical copies of a piece of DNA, such as a
gene.
CLONE
• A clone is an organism
having an exact genetic
copy i.e. every single bit of
their DNA is identical.
• Dolly was the first mammal
sheep to have been cloned
successfully in the year
1996.
DNA cloning
• A process of producing multiple and identical copies
of a particular section of DNA is called as DNA
cloning.
• During this technique, the selected DNA fragment is
inserted into a plasmid (the circular piece of DNA)
using enzymes.
• The enzymes used in this process are called as
restriction enzymes and DNA ligase enzymes.
• These restriction enzymes, naturally found in
bacteria are used to cut the DNA fragments at
specific sequences
• and DNA ligase enzymes are used to paste or re-join
the DNA fragments with complementary ends.
DNA cloning
• The produced molecule of
recombinant DNA is introduced
into a selected and grown up
bacteria.
• These bacteria reproduce by
producing an exact copy of the
plasmid and transferring it to
their progeny, making copies of
the DNA it contains.
Importance of DNA cloning
• The DNA molecules produced through the cloning techniques are used for
many purposes which includes:
• There is need of more DNA copies for studying about the different gene,
its functions, the cause of different diseases and for other research and
experiments.
• Cloning livestock, and for reviving endangered or extinct species.
• Gene therapy used to treat some genetic disorders and replacement of a
particular gene.
• In pharmaceuticals industries for the production of recombinant protein to
produce human proteins with biomedical applications.
• For example:
1. The gene from the human insulin is expressed into the E. coli bacteria in
order to produce the insulin hormone which is used by diabetics.
2. Human growth hormone is used to treat those patients who are unable to
synthesize the growth hormone naturally.
3. Tissue plasminogen activator is used both in preventing blood clots and
treating strokes.
• Gene cloning in agriculture:
 Crop breeding by facilitating the direct changes to the genotype
of a plant.
 Altering the characteristics of a plant by providing it with one or
more new genes.
 By inactivating one or more of the plant’s existing genes rather
than removing them.
DNA Fingerprinting
“DNA fingerprinting is a technique that shows the genetic
makeup of living things. It is a method of finding the
difference between the satellite DNA regions in the genome.”
Alec Jeffreys developed this technique in which he used satellite DNAs
also called VNTRs (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) as a probe
because it showed the high level of polymorphism.
Following are the steps involved in DNA fingerprinting:
DNA Fingerprinting Steps
Isolating the DNA.
Digesting the DNA with the help of restriction
endonuclease enzymes.
Separating the digested fragments as per the fragment
size by the process of electrophoresis.
Blotting the separated fragments onto synthetic
membranes like nylon.
Hybridising the fragments using labelled VNTR probes.
DNA Fingerprinting Applications
Transcription
• It is one of the first processes in gene expression.
• RNA polymerase which is an enzyme copies a particular segment of
DNA into RNA.
• Transcription Unit is a stretch of a DNA transcribed into an RNA
molecule. Its function is to encode at least one gene.
Protein synthesis – Translation
• The process by which the mRNA codes for a
particular protein is known as Translation.
• In the process, the ribosome translates the
mRNA produced from DNA into a chain of
specific amino acids.
• This chain of amino acids leads to protein
synthesis.
• It is a process where the expense of ATP is
required and this energy is given by the
charged tRNA.
• The whole machinery of translation is present
in the ribosome.
• Chromosomes
 Thread like structures present in the nucleus.
 Discovered by Waldyer and seen by Strasberg.
• GENE
 A thread-like structure of nucleic acids and protein found in the
nucleus of most living cells, carrying genetic information in the
form of genes. It is a unit of heredity.
 A Unit of inheritance transferred from a parent to offspring and
is held to determine some characteristics.
AUTOSOMES V/S ALLOSOMES
• Autosomes- Chromosomes which
defines Physical structure – 44 in
number or 22 pairs
• Allosomes – Sex chromosomes – 2
in number – 1 pair
• Two types :
 Men – XY Heterogametic
 Women- XX Homogametic
• It is seen at some rural places that
women are blamed for the sex of a
child but this practice is a myth as
this is the natural phenomenon
and 50% probability of male or
female offsprings but if someone
has to be responsible for this is
solely male because of the
heterogametic chromosomes.

Mughal
Administration
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Mughal Administration:
Key Features & Structure
• The mughal empire was divided into "Subas" which were further
subdivided into "Sarkar","Pargana", and "Gram".
• There were 12 Subas (provinces) durng Akbar's reigns, which later
increased to 21 under the Auranzeb's reign.
• Akbar introduced the Mansabdari system.
• The term "Mansab" indicates the rank of the holder.
• Mansabdari was both civil and military.
• During Mughal administration there were 3 methods of revenue collection
i.e. Kankut, Rai And Zabti.
Central Administration
• Enjoying the absolute power, the Emperor of the Mughal Empire
was always the central administrative authority.
• A number of officers in the different governmental departments
were appointed for the smooth functioning of transactions
involving various affairs.
• The state had four main departments and the four main officers of
the central government were diwan; Mir bakhshi; Mir saman;
and sadr.
Central Administration
• The diwan (also called the Wazir or chief minister), held the primary
position among them and looked after revenue and finance, but
kept an overview of all matters of expenditure and related
departments recording all imperial orders and assigning duties and
expense to district faujdars.
• Mir Bakshi handled the military pay and accounts and related
duties. He not only was the Paymaster for all officers but also
played role in recruitment of soldiers, listing of mansabdars and
important officials.
Central Administration
• The imperial household was held by Khan-i-Saman.
• He dealt with matters relating to maintaining record and requirement of the
state karkhanas, stores, order, interactions and internal relations.
• The Sadr was the head of religious donations and contributions. He also
looked after education and imperial alms.
• Sadr acted as the Chief Qazi before Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb divided these two
offices and allotted two separate persons for these posts.
• Occasionally a dignitary superior to the wazir and other ministers was also
appointed called the vakil. He acted as the deputy of the sultanate (naib).
Provincial Administration
• Akbar set the firm base for the provincial administration by fixing the
territories of the provincial units and establishing a uniform administrative
model subjected to minor amendment to suit local circumstances.
• Each province had a set of officials representing the branches of state activity,
which made control over provinces more effective.
• The provincial administrative structure was the replica of that of the central
government.
• Sipah Salaror Nazim (the governor) well known by the name subahdar was
appointed directly by the Emperor and was the main officer looking after civil
and administrative responsibility of each Suba.
Provincial Administration
• The Bakshi or the paymaster was the next provincial authority having
duties of military establishment, salaries of Mansabdars and occasional
duties like news writing for provinces.
• In every Suba (province) was established the Dag Choki that conducted
the intelligence and postal service.
• The Waqai Navis and Waqai Nigars supplied direct reports to the King
and Sawanih Nigars were the confidential report providers.
• Provincial Sadr, Qazi etc performed the same duties within provinces as
the central administration officials.
• The faujdars (administrative head of district) and the kotwal (performing
executive and ministerial duties)
Local Administration
• At the village level, the subas were divided into Sarkars which were further
subdivided into Parganas.
• Faujdar (chief executive head of a Sarkar) was responsible for maintaining law and
order in his jurisdiction and the executed the royal decrees and regulations. He
also kept the powerful Zamindars under check.
• Amalguzar or the revenue collector was the next important officer.
• Shiqdar maintained the general administration and law and order of Pargana
assisted by Amil (revenue collector), Amin (assessor of revenue), Patadar
(treasurer), Qanungo (keeper of land record) and Bitikchis (clerks).
• Village head or the Muqaddam (sarpanch) dealt with functions locally.
• The Patwari assisted him by taking care of village revenue records.
Revenue Administration
• Land revenue was the major source of the income.
• Akbar had instituted a system of Dahsala/Bandobast Arazi/the Zabti
system. Under which, the average produce of different crops and the
average prices from the last ten years were calculated.
• One-third of the average was the share of the state that was mentioned in
cash.
• Land revenue was fixed considering both, continuity and productivity of
cultivation. Polaj (land continually cultivated), parauti (fallow lands for an
year) paid full prices when under cultivation.
Revenue Administration
• After assessing land revenue in kind, value was converted into cash using
price list or dastur-ul-amal, prepared at regional level for various food
crops.
• The empire was divided into numerous regions-dastur, at pargana level,
that had similar productivity.
• The government provided the dastur-ul-amal at tehsil level and it
explained the style of land revenue payment.
• Each cultivator got a title for land holding or patta and qubuliyat (deed of
agreement by which he pays state revenue).
• Various other assessment system were followed under Akbar’s reign.
Revenue Administration
• The most common was called batai or ghallabakshi (crop-sharing)
subdivided into three parts
• (i) bhaoli -reaped and stacked crops divided in the presence of the parties.
• (ii) khet batai –dividing fields after sowing
• (iii) lang batai- division of grain heaps.
• Kankut—In Kankut –measuring the land and estimating standing crops by
inspection.
• Nasaq—a rough calculation of payable amount by the peasant, keeping in
minds his past experience.
Military Administration
• Soldiers, horsemen, horses and elephants has to be supplied and maintained
by the mansabdars.
• The number that a mansabdar was expected to provide was specific in his
warrant of selection or were indicated by the rank he held.
• The classes of troops under the Mansabdars were:
• dakhili (services of which were paid by the state),
• ahadis (the "gentlemen troopers," who drew higher pay than ordinary
servicemen).
• The chiefs were also permitted to hold a degree of autonomy while providing
deputation under their own command.
Military Administration
• The army had the following five units:
• (1) Cavalry having two types of horsemen:
1. ‘Bargir’, soldiers receiving horses, arms, dress etc. from the state
and
2. ‘Siledar’, soldiers who brought their own horses and arms.
• (2) Infantry: Infantry was structured in two units
1. ‘Bandukchi’ (Riflemen) and
2. ‘Samshirbaz’ (Swordsmen).
• (3) War elephants: The elephants were used for fighting as well as for
carrying load.
Military Administration
• (4) Artillery: The artillery reached its highest proficiency in Akbar’s time.
• (5) Navy: the Mughals had a weak naval base compared to the Europeans.
• The artillery for the army was paid wholly out of the imperial treasury.
• The organization of the army was loose and the scantiness of officers
reduced the efficiency of the army.
• The discipline was poor, particularly in lower ranks.
• The Mughals took along a great number of camp followers, which
occasionally included the families of the soldiers.
Mansabdari System
• The Mughal nobility or mansabdars looked after the administration of the
state the central authority of which lay with the Emperor, like the power of
conferring, increasing, decreasing the mansab.
• Frequent transfers of jagirs were made to maintain insecurities among the
Mansabdars.
• Mansab was the grant to enjoy a jagir given to every official.
• Jagir was the revenue assignment as a substitute of a cash salary (not
land) for services delivered.
• The mansabdar could collect revenue from his jagir through the Zamindars
collecting dues from cultivators.
Mansabdari System
• No hereditary claim could be made and on the death of a Mansab
his personal property taken by the State, of which the balance
owed to state was deducted and balance was returned to his heirs.
• Mansabs could be called to give duties in both military and civil
spheres in any part of the empire. They played a considerable role
in the economic, social and cultural life around them.
• The system promoted exploitation of people in the lower stature
and created selfishness, corruption.
Jagirdari System
• Under the reign of Akbar land was divided into two categories - Khalisa and Jagir.
• Land revenue of Khalisa was directly for the royal treasury and Jagirs were
allocated to the Jagirdars according to their rank.
• Mansabdars receiving cash payment were known as Naqdi.
• The jagirs were the assignment of revenue given to the Mansabdars and the
assignees were Jagirdars.
• This was similar to the Iqtas and the Iqtadars under Delhi Sultans.
• There were four types of Jagirs – Jagir Tankha (given in lieu of pay), Mashrut Jagirs
(given on certain conditions), Inam Jagir (independent of any obligation) and
Watan Jagir (assigned in the homelands).
Jagirdari System
• The Revenue Department maintained a record Jama-Dami that indicated
the assessed income (jama) of various areas, indicated in dams, calculated
as 40 dams to a rupee.
• The Jagirs were transferable and no Jagirdar was given a same Jagir for a
long time.
• This system was to check the ability of Jagirdars to maintain a area and
control the exploitation or tyranny of Jagirdars.

Study of Plants (Botany)
• MESOPHYTES
 Those plants which require moderate supply of water. Ex: corn
• XEROPHYTES
 Those which live in deserts or dry places and can withstand scantly
supply of water. Ex- cactus
• HYDROPHYTES
 Those which thrive in watery or moist places and require abundant
supply of water.
 Ex: Water lilies, Nymphaea Alba, Nelumbo Nucifera, Water Hyacinth
etc
Study of Plants (Botany)
• HALOPHYTES
 Those which live in watery places, but in which the water is
absorbed with difficulty because of its high salt content.
 Eg:- Sea-grasses are found on the seaward edges of lagoons,
Mangroves.
Classification
• Based on their habitat or environment location
 Aquatic plants- live in water
 Terrestrial plants – live on land
 Aerial plants – are above- ground and attached to other
plants. Ex: orchids
Classification
• Based on plants life duration
 Annual plants- live for one year or only one growing season.
Examples: corn, wheat, rice
 Biennial plants – live for two years. The first year is mainly
limited to vegetative growth, and the second year is its
reproductive year, produce flowers in 2nd year. Examples :
onion, carrot
 Perennial plants – Produce seeds year after year. Examples:
fruits like pineapple, strawberry, banana, apple, tomato.
Classification
• Based on plants habit of body appearance
 Trees- woody plants with single main stem which is commonly
about 20 ft in length.
 Shrubs – woody plants in a relatively short. Ex: roses, jasmine
 Herbs – Plants with soft stems. Ex : basil, mint
• * All herbs can be shrubs, but not all shrubs are herbs.
Classification of plants
• Cryptogamae and Phanerogamae
 In 1883, A.W.Eichler gave a system of classification for the
whole plant kingdom.
 Eichler classified the plant kingdom into two sub- kingdoms.
 They are cryptogamae and phanerogamae.
Classification of plants
Classification of plants
• THALLOPHYTA
 Undifferentiated body are called Thallus. They don’t have
vascular system. Ex : algae, lichens
• BRYOPHYTA
 No proper root or shoot system., no vascular system. Ex:
Mosses, liverworts and hornworts.
• PTERIDOPHYTA
 It has differentiated root or shoot system. The vascular system is
present. Ex: Ferns
Classification of plants
• GYMNOSPERMS
 They don’t have flowers, seeds are naked and born on scales of
cones. Ex: Evergreen, cycads
• ANGIOSPERMS
 They have flowering plants, have seeds, contained in a fruit. Ex:
Monocotyledons, Dicotyledons.
Cryptogamae vs. Phanerogamae
Cryptogams Phanerogams
They reproduce by forming spores They reproduce by forming seeds
Their reproductive organs are hidden Their reproductive organs are exposed
They are less evolved plants They are highly evolved plants
Mostly thylophyta, bryophyta and
pteridophyta are cryptogams
All angiosperms and gymnosperms are
phanerogams
Eg. Mosses and ferns etc. Eg. Mango, rose, pine, banyan etc.
CRYPTOGAMME
• The Cryptogamme are flowerless and seedless plants.
• They are simple plants like algae, mosses and ferns which do not
produce flowers, fruits and seeds.
• Cryptogams are considered as lower plants. It contains three main
groups: Thallophyte, Bryophyte and Pteridophyte.
THALLOPHYTA
• largest group of plant kingdom.
• It is commonly not
differentiated into stem, leaves
and roots, and show no distinct
tissue systems. These are
mostly aquatic plants and found
both in fresh and marine water.
• Ex: algae, fungi and lichens
ALGAE
• Algae are chlorophyll bearing thallophytes. They are mostly aquatic
occurring in fresh water and in sea.
• They exhibit autotrophic mode of nutrition. Example: chlorella,
Chlamydomonas, Cladospora, Sargassum, Gelidium, Laminaria.
• They are largest producer of carbohydrates. Some forms are edible
like Ulva (sea lettuce).
• Agar agar extracted from algae gelidium (Red Algae) used as a
solidifying agent in culture medium.
ALGAE
• Sometimes colour of sea and
snow shows the colour of
algae. (Chlamydomonas Nivalis)
• For making sweets, bakery,
toothpaste etc.
• Lichen: Symbiotic Association
of Algae and Fungi
• Cholrella Algae Space algae
• Brown Algae
BRYOPHYTES
• Amphibians of Plant Kingdom (live on both land
and water)
• lack vascular tissues, (no specialized means of
transporting water and organic nutrients), do not
have true roots, stems and leaves.
• All are non-vascular and non-seed. Sometimes
called amphibious plants as they grow on land as
well as water. Ex: liverworts, mosses and
hornworts.
• Sphagnum : used as fuel, antiseptics, gardeners
used it to protect from drying while taking the
plants from one place to another.
PTERIDOPHYTES (ferns)
• The division include
first vascular land
plants.
• All the plants have
vascular tissue.
• They do not produce
flowers and seeds.
PHANEROGAMAE
• They are seed bearing plants with evident reproductive organs
called flowers.
• They are of two types: Gymnosperms and angiosperms.
• Characteristics : The plant body differentiated into true stem, leaves
and roots.
• The vascular tissues are present which forms a vascular system.
GYMNOSPERMS
• They are seed-bearing vascular plants,
seeds are not enclosed in an ovary.
• The word “gymnosperm” meaning
“naked seeds”.
• Examples: cedar, pine, red-wood trees,
conifers, spruce, fir, pine.
• Gymnosperms are vascular plants that
produce seeds on scales of woody
strobili called cones.
GYMNOSPERMS
• In other words, they have naked
seeds – seeds not enclosed in a
fruit.
• Ex: Conifers, Cycads, Gingkaphyta
and gnetales.
• The coniferous trees grow up
instead of out like a deciduous tree
and are shaped like a triangle.
• The leaves are usually long, pointy
needles.
GYMNOSPERMS
• Characteristics of gymnosperms:
 Terpentile oil is extracted from pinus.
 Chilgoza is the seed of Pinus Gerardiana.
 Cycas (sago palm) is a source of sago. Also source of Sabudana from
the starch. Cycas is living fossil.
 Ephedra is a source of medicine Ephedrine.
 Tarpine from Pinus
• Sequoia Gigantica is the longest plant ( Red wood of California )
• Zaimia Pygmia is the smallest plant.
ANGIOSPERM
• They are seed- bearing vascular
plants.
• Their reproductive structures are
flowers in which the ovules are
enclosed in an ovary.
• They are of two types:
 Monocot (has one cotyledons)
 Dicot (has two cotyledons)
Monocot vs. Dicot
Roots
• Develop from Radicle part (Descending
part of the plant)
• Two types:
 Primary root/Tap root: Main root
which grows straight downwards and
from which smaller roots grow.
 Adventitious Roots: From any other
parts of plants other than roots.
TYPES OF TAP ROOTS
1. Conical roots like in
carrot.
2. Fusiform roots like in
radish.
3. Napiform roots like in
beetroot, turnip etc.
Adventitious Roots
• From any other parts of plants
other than roots. (stem, leaves,
nodes and internodes)
• Two types :
• Aerial and underground

Types of roots system
• Tap roots of carrot, turnip and adventitious roots
of sweet potato, get swollen and store food.
• Hanging structures that support a banyan tree
are called prop roots.
• Similarly, the stems of maize and sugarcane
have supporting roots coming out of the lower
nodes of the stem. These are called stilt roots.
• In some plants such as Rhizophora growing in
swampy areas, many roots come out of the
ground and grow vertically upwards. Such roots,
called pneumatophores, help to get oxygen for
respiration.
Epiphytic roots
• An epiphyte is an organism that grows on the
surface of a plant and derives its moisture and
nutrients from the air, rain, water or from
debris accumulating around it.
• Epiphytes take part in nutrient cycles and add
to both the diversity and biomass of the
ecosystem in which they occur, like any other
organism.
Stem
• The region of the stem where leaves are born are called
nodes while internodes are the portions between two
nodes.
• Some stems perform the function of storage of food,
support, protection and of vegetative propagation.
• Underground stems of potato, ginger, turmeric,
zaminkand, colocasia are modified to store food in them.
• Stem tendrils which develop from axillary buds, are
slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb such
as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and
grapevines.
Stem
• Axillary buds of stems may also get modified into
woody, straight and pointed thorns.
• Thorns are found in many plants such as Citrus,
Bougainvillea. They protect plants from browsing
animals.
• Some plants of arid regions modify their stems
into flattened (Opuntia), or fleshy cylindrical
(Euphorbia) structures. They contain chlorophyll
and carry out photosynthesis.
• Underground stems of some plants such as grass
and strawberry, etc., spread to new niches and
when older parts die new plants are formed.
The Leaf
• Leaves originate from shoot apical
meristems. Leaf develops at the node and
bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud
later develops into a branch.
• A typical leaf consists of three main parts:
leaf base, petiole and lamina.
• The petiole help hold the blade to light.
• Long thin flexible petioles allow leaf
blades to flutter in wind, thereby cooling
the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf
surface.
The Leaf
• The lamina or the leaf blade is the
green expanded part of the leaf with
veins and veinlets. There is, usually, a
middle prominent vein, which is
known as the midrib.
• Veins provide rigidity to the leaf
blade and act as channels of
transport for water, minerals and
food materials.
Leaf Venation
• The arrangement of veins and the
veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed
as venation.
• When the veinlets form a network, the
venation is termed as reticulate. When
the veins run parallel to each other
within a lamina, the venation is termed
as parallel.
• Leaves of dicotyledonous plants
generally possess reticulate venation,
while parallel venation is the
characteristic of most monocotyledons.
Leaf Venation
Transpiration
• Plants absorb mineral nutrients and water from the soil. Not all the
water absorbed is utilised by the plant.
• The water evaporates through the stomata present on the surface
of the leaves by the process of transpiration.
• The evaporation of water from leaves generates a suction pull (the
same that you produce when you suck water through a straw)
which can pull water to great heights in the tall trees.
• Transpiration also cools the plant.
Water absorption
• Water absorption through roots can be increased by keeping the
plants
 a) in the shade
 b) in dim light
 c) under the fan
 d) covered with a polythene bag
IMPORTANT TERMS
• Horticulture- Cultivation of flowers, fruits, vegetables and
ornamental plants.
• Viticulture – Production and cultivation of grapes.
• Olericulture – Science of growing vegetables.
• Silviculture – cultivation of forest trees.
• Sericulture – rearing of silk worms for silk.
• Apiculture – rearing of honeybees.
IMPORTANT TERMS
• Phototropism is the growth of organisms in response to light. It is
because of AUXIN.
IMPORTANT TERMS
• Thigmotropism is a movement in which a plant moves or grows in
response to touch or contact stimuli. Ex: Memosa Pudica(touch me not).
Facts
• Largest angiosperm tree- Eucalyptus
• Longest tree in the world- Sequoia Giganteum(120m), it’s called
coast red wood of California.
• Smallest angiosperm- lemna (Duckweeds)
• Plant with largest leaf – Victoria regia
• Largest seed – lodoicea (Double coconut).

• NILGIRI oil is obtained from Eucalyptus.
• CHICORY which is a coffee substitute is got from Cichorium Intybus.
• Anti- malarial drug QUININE obtained from bark of Cinchona tree.
• Turpentine is obtained from pine tree.
• Anti – hypertensive drug reserpine is obtained from rauwolfia
serpentine/ Sarpagandha.
Facts
• Blue dye/ neel got from indigo.
• Bio- diesel got from Jatropha.
• The aquatic plant which is called terror of Bengal- Water hyacinth.
• Opium got from poppy/ Papaver Somniferum.
• Marijuana is obtained from cannabis.
• Cocaine is obtained from coca plant.
PLANT TISSUES
• A group or collection of similar cells performing or help to perform
same function and arise from the same origin are called tissues.
• The tissues are of different types depending on the functions of the
organism. They are mainly of two categories
1. Plant tissues
2. Animal tissues.
ROOT AND SHOOT SYSTEM
• Root system- anchors the plant, penetrates the soil and
absorbs water and minerals, also stores food
• Shoot system- produces sugars by photosynthesis and also
carries out reproduction.

MERISTEMS
• The main characteristic of
this tissue is that it is
responsible for the growth
of plants.
• The cells of this tissue
continuously divide and
later differentiate (i.e. get
converted) into permanent
tissue.
MERISTEMS
• Characteristics of the cells/ tissue
 The cells are made of thin & elastic cell wall made of cellulose.
 The cells may be round , oval, polygonal or rectangular in shape.
 They are compact, having no intercellular space.
 There is a large nucleus and abundant cytoplasm.
 The protoplasm contains very few or no vacuoles at all. This
tissue occurs at specific regions of the plant body
MERISTEMS
Characteristics of the cells/ tissue
• This is so because in plant body growth occurs only at these
regions. Hence, on the basis of this there are 3 types of meristem :
1. APICAL MERISTEM
2. INTERCALARY MERISTEM
3. LATERAL MERISTEM
MERISTEMS
• APICAL MERISTEMS
 As the name suggests this tissue is
present at the apex of the main &
lateral shoots and roots.
 This tissue gives the plant body a
linear growth.
MERISTEMS
• LATERAL MERISTEMS
 This tissue lies on the sides of the plant
body.
 It lies under the bark of the plant in form
of cork cambium.
 It gives the plant it’s width or girth.
• INTERCALARY MERISTEMS
 This tissue is present at the base of the
nodes, internodes, leaves etc.
 They are also present in between the
permanent tissue.
 They give the plant growth in length.
PERMANENT TISSUES
• These tissues arise from the meristematic tissue.
• The cells of this tissue gradually loose their power to divide and
acquire a definite shape, size and function.
• These tissues may be living or dead.
• There are 2 types of permanent tissues
 Simple permanent tissue
 Complex permanent tissue
SIMPLE TISSUES
• This tissue comprises of same type of cells which perform the same
function and all arise from the same origin. There are three
categories of simple permanent tissues: Parenchyma, Collenchyma,
& Sclerenchyma.
PARENCHYMA
• Characteristics:
 The cells are living.
 The cells are thin walled.
 There may or may not be intercellular
spaces.
 They are the most unspecialized cells.
 No depositions are seen, the cell wall
consists only of cellulose.
 There is a prominent nucleus, cytoplasm &
vacuoles.
PARENCHYMA
• There are some special types of parenchyma tissues :
 Storage parenchyma : The cells enlarge to store nutrients & water.
 Aerenchyma : Air cavities are present in the parenchyma tissue to
provide buoyancy to the aquatic plants.
 Chlorenchyma : These parenchyma cells have presence of chlorophyll
& hence can perform the function of photosynthesis.
• Parenchyma tissue is found generally in all parts of the plant body.
It forms the Ground tissue in leaves, stem, roots & fruits etc
Functions of parenchyma
• To store materials such as starch, proteins, hormones etc and waste
products such as gum, tannin, resin etc.
• Parenchyma cells perform the metabolic activities of the plant.
• Forms the packaging tissue between the specialized tissue.(large
vacuole)
• By providing turgidity , they provide mechanical strength.
• Chlorenchyma helps in performing photosynthesis.
COLLENCHYMA
• It has cells which are somewhat elongated.
• The cell walls are thin except at the angular
region ( where the cells join). The thickenings
are caused due to deposition of cellulose or
pectin.
• There is or less intercellular space.
• The cells are living, have distinct nucleus &
dense protoplasm.
• They often contain chlorophyll.
COLLENCHYMA
• Functions :
 Providing mechanical strength is the primary function.
 Provide flexibility.
 Photosynthesis, as they contain chlorophyll.
• They are present below the epidermis in dicot stems and leaves.
They are absent in dicot and all type of monocot plants.
SCLERENCHYMA
• It supports mature plant parts.
• It protects many seeds.
• Cells have thick, lignified walls and are
dead at maturity, made of LIGNIN.
COMPLEX TISSUE
• Complex permanent tissue consists of a number of dissimilar cells
which perform a common function. It forms vascular or conducting
tissue in the plant. They are of two types:
 Xylem
 Phloem
XYLEM and PHLOEM
XYLEM
• Xylem is responsible for conduction of mineral
salt and water from roots to upper region and
also provides mechanical support to the plant
body.
• Xylem is also called as wood and forms the
bulk of roots and stem of vascular plants.
• Xylem is composed of three types of cells
some of which are living and some non-living.
• The vascular tissues are made up of:
 Xylem vessels - the main conducting cells
 Xylem tracheids - also conduct water but
are not as well adapted as vessels for this
function
XYLEM
 Xylem fibres – they have no role in
water transport but function in
support
 Xylem parenchyma - this acts as
packing tissue.
• Vessels and tracheids are dead cells and
they form a system of tubes through which
water can travel.
• TRACHEARY ELEMENTS- These participate
in conduction of sap (water and minerals).
 Types: tracheids and vessels.
XYLEM
• VESSELS: Vessels are elongated tubular
structures with a wide lumen. It is formed
by a series of cylindrical cells which are
joined end-to-end and have perforated
walls. The vessels are dead, thick walled and
lignified.
• TRACHEIDS: They are elongated, thick
walled, dead tubular cells with lignified
walls. The tracheids are smaller than vessels
and form chief conducting element of xylem
in gymnosperm and pteridophyte where
vessels are absent.
XYLEM
• WOOD FIBRE/ XYLEM FIBRE
 They are sclerenchyma fibres.
 They are distinguished from tracheids
on basis of their comparatively thicker
walls and obliterated central lumens.
 These fibres are of two types: libriform
fibres have thick cell walls, simple pits
and obliterated central lumens
XYLEM
• WOOD PARENCHYMA: Parenchymatous cells
present in the xylem. It is the only living
component of the xylem. The cells are thin or
thick walled with simple pits. These cells store
food material in the form of starch or fat.
• ROLE OF XYLEM
 Absorbs Water and Mineral salts
 Oxygen
 Resistance to forces
 Supporting and strengthening
PHLOEM
• It transport sugars by the process known as translocation (The
transport of soluble products of photosynthesis is called translocation
and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue known as phloem), the
translocation in phloem is achieved by utilizing energy.
• Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using energy
from ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue causing
water to move into it.
• This pressure moves the material in the phloem to tissues which have
less pressure. This allows the phloem to move material according to
the plant’s needs.
PHLOEM
• For example, in the spring, sugar stored
in root or stem tissue would be
transported to the buds which need
energy to grow. Phloem consists of four
types of cells:
 Sieve tubes,
 Companion cells,
 Phloem parenchyma,
 Pholem fibres.
• It is meant for conduction of organic food
inside the plant body.
PHLOEM
• Sieve tubes
 These are elongated tubular living cells with thin
walls made up of cellulose.
 Cells possess transverse walls and are placed end to
end.
 The pores are present on end walls forming sieve
plates and also along lateral wall forming sieve areas.
 These pores from continuous channels for
translocation of organic food.
 Young sieve tube has nucleus which disintegrates at
maturity and develop large vacuole. At this stage its
activity is regulated by adjacent companion cells.
PHLOEM
• Companion cells
 These are thin walled cells associated with sieve
tubes, assisting them in conduction of food. They
have a dense cytoplasm and a prominent nucleus.
It is connected to sieve tubes by plasmodesmata.
Thus they control the activity of sieve tubes
through plasmodesmata. The companion cells are
present only in angiosperms.
• Pholem parenchyma
 These are parenchymatous cells present in
pholem which store food and assist in its
conduction in radial directions.
DENDROLOGY
• The scientific study of wood and wooden trees.
• DENDROCHRONOLOGY
 Tree-ring dating, is the scientific method of dating based on the
analysis of patterns of tree rings, also known as growth rings.
 This is an outdated method now. So, carbon dating is used using
radioactive isotope of carbon (C-14).
The Flower
• The flower is the reproductive unit in the
angiosperms.
• It is meant for sexual reproduction.
• Androecium and gynoecium are reproductive
organs.
• When a flower has both androecium and
gynoecium, it is bisexual.
• A flower having either only stamens or only
carpels is unisexual.
• Aestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals
or petals in floral bud with respect to the other
members of the same whorl is known as
aestivation.
Androecium
• Androecium is composed of stamens.
• Each stamen which represents the male
reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a
filament and an anther.
• Each anther is usually bilobed and each
lobe has two chambers, the pollen-sacs.
• The pollen grains are produced in pollensacs.
• A sterile stamen is called staminode.
Gynoecium
• Gynoecium is the female reproductive
part of the flower and is made up of one
or more carpels. A carpel consists of
three parts namely stigma, style and
ovary.
• After fertilization, the ovules develop into
seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.
• Placentation: The arrangement of ovules
within the ovary is known as
placentation.
THE PARTS OF A FLOWER
• Male part – also called stamen, stamen
contains anther (contains pollens or
male sperm) and filament.
• Female part – also called carpel (pistil),
contains style, stigma and ovary.
• Non reproductive part contains:
Thalamus (it develops into fruit by
parthenocarpy called pseudofruit),
sepals and petals.
• Stamens and Pistil(carpel) are the
reproductive parts of a flower which
contain the germ-cells.
THE PARTS OF A FLOWER
• The flower may be unisexual (papaya, watermelon) when
it contains either stamens or pistil or bisexual (Hibiscus,
mustard) when it contains both stamens and pistil.
• Stamen is the male reproductive part and it produces
pollen grains that are yellowish in colour.
• Pistil is present in the centre of a flower and is the female
reproductive part.
• The swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated
part is the style and the terminal part which may be sticky
is the stigma.
• The ovary contains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell.
REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS
• The male germ-cell produced by pollen grain fuses
with the female gamete present in the ovule.
• This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us
the zygote which is capable of growing into a new
plant.
• Thus the pollen needs to be transferred from the
stamen to the stigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs
in the same flower, it is referred to as self-pollination.
• On the other hand, if the pollen is transferred from
one flower to another, it is known as cross
pollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to
another is achieved by agents like wind, water or
animals.
REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS
• After the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has
to reach the female germ-cells which are in the
ovary.
• For this, a tube grows out of the pollen grain and
travels through the style to reach the ovary.
• After fertilisation, the zygote divides several
times to form an embryo within the ovule.
• The ovule develops a tough coat and is gradually
converted into a seed.
• The ovary grows rapidly and ripens to form a fruit.
The Fruit
• The fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants.
• It is a mature or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation.
• If a fruit is formed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a
parthenocarpic fruit.
• The Seed: The ovules after fertilisation, develop into seeds.
POLLINATION

Nutrition in Plants
• Nutrition is the mode of taking food by an organism and its utilization by
the body.
• The mode of nutrition in which organisms make food themselves from
simple substances is called autotrophic (auto = self; trophos =
nourishment) nutrition Therefore, plants are called autotrophs.
• Animals and most other organisms take in readymade food prepared by
the plants. They are called heterotrophs (heteros = other).
• Insectivorous plants have both autotrophic and heterotrophic mode of
nutrition.
Photosynthesis – Food Making Process In Plants
• Carbon dioxide from air is taken in through the tiny pores
present on the surface of the leaves. These pores are
surrounded by ‘guard cells’. Such pores are called
stomata.
• Water and minerals are transported to the leaves by the
vessels which run like pipes throughout the root, the
stem, the branches and the leaves. They form a
continuous The leaves have a green pigment called
chlorophyll. It helps leaves to capture the energy of the
sunlight.
• This energy is used to synthesise (prepare) food
from carbon dioxide and water.
Photosynthesis – Food Making Process In Plants
• Since the synthesis of food occurs in the presence of sunlight, it
is called photosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis: to combine).
• So we find that chlorophyll, sunlight, carbon dioxide and water
are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis.
• Thus, sun is the ultimate source of energy for all living
organisms. Water enters into the cells of leaves through
osmosis.
• Carbon dioxide through atmosphere or release during
respiration. Water absorbed by roots and oxygen produced is
due to photolysis of water.
• Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes place in other green
parts of the plant — in green stems and green branches.
Photosynthesis – Food Making Process In Plants
• The desert plants have scale or spine-like leaves to reduce loss of water by
transpiration. These plants have green stems which carry out
photosynthesis.
• During photosynthesis, chlorophyll containing cells of leaves, in the
presence of sunlight, use carbon dioxide and water to synthesise
carbohydrates. The carbohydrates ultimately get converted into starch.
• The leaves other than green also have chlorophyll. The large amount of
red, brown and other pigments mask the green colour. Photosynthesis
takes place in these leaves also.
Chlorophyll Pigments
• Within the leaves, the mesophyll cells have a
large number of chloroplasts that are
responsible for CO2 fixation.
• A chromatographic separation of the leaf
pigments shows that the colour that we see in
leaves is not due to a single pigment but due to
four pigments: Chlorophyll a (bright or blue
green in the chromatogram), chlorophyll b
(yellow green), xanthophylls (yellow) and
carotenoids (yellow to yellow-orange).
• Chlorophyll a and b are common.
Chlorophyll Pigments
• Mg is present in cholorophll.
• It absorbs violet, blue and red colour of light.
• Photosynthess maximum in red colour of light and less in violet
colour of light.
• Photosynthesis range 400 to 700 nm
• Oxidation of water takes place forming oxygen and reduction of
carbon dioxide takes place forming glucose.
Light Reactions and Dark Reactions
• Within the chloroplast there is the membranous
system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae,
and the fluid stroma. There is a clear division of
labour within the chloroplast.
• The membrane system is responsible for
trapping the light energy and also for the
synthesis of ATP and NADPH. [light reactions]
• In the light reaction the light energy is absorbed
by the pigments present in the antenna, and
funnelled to special chlorophyll a molecules
called reaction centre chlorophylls.
Light Reactions and Dark Reactions
• In stroma, enzymatic reactions incorporate
CO2 [chemosynthetic pathway- carbon fixing
reactions] into the plant leading to the
synthesis of sugar, which in turn forms
starch. [dark reactions]
• The former set of reactions, since they are
directly light driven are called light reactions.
The latter are not directly light driven but are
dependent on the products of light reactions
(ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the
latter they are called, by convention, as dark
reactions.
Light Reactions and Dark Reactions
• However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in
darkness or that they are not light-dependent.
• Photochemical reaction occurs in grana part of chlorophyll. It is also
called Hill reaction.
• Dark chemical reaction occurs in the stroma part of chlorophyll. It is
also called Blackmann reaction.
Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
• Law of Limiting Factors: If a chemical process is affected by more
than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which
is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects
the process if its quantity is changed.
• For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light
and CO2 conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the
temperature is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal temperature,
will start photosynthesising.
Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
• Carbon dioxide Concentration
 The concentration of CO 2 is very low in the atmosphere (between
0.03 and 0.04 per cent). Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent
can cause an increase in CO 2 fixation rates; beyond this the levels can
become damaging over longer periods.
• Water
 Water stress causes the stomata to close hence reducing the CO2
availability. Besides, water stress also makes leaves wilt, thus, reducing
the surface area of the leaves and their metabolic activity as well.
Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
• Temperature
 The dark reactions being enzymatic are temperature controlled.
Though the light reactions are also temperature sensitive they
are affected to a much lesser extent.
 The temperature optimum for photosynthesis of different plants
also depends on the habitat that they are adapted to.
 Tropical plants have a higher temperature optimum than the
plants adapted to temperate climates.
Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
• Light
 There is a linear relationship between incident light and CO2 fixation rates at low light
intensities.
 At higher light intensities, gradually the rate does not show further increase as other
factors become limiting.
 Pigments responsible for colours in plants and fruits.
 Yellow colour of the leaves is due to carotene.
 Carotenoids provide yellow and orange color in leaves, also the yellow color of leaves.
 Red color in tomatoes, watermelon, guava is due to lycopene.
 Yellow color in lemon, oranges is due to flavanoids.
 Deep red of beetroot is due to Betalains.
Macronutrients and Micronutrients in Plants
Macronutrients are generally present in plant tissues in large amounts.
The macronutrients include
 1. Carbon
 2. Hydrogen
 3. Oxygen
 4. Nitrogen
 5. Phosphorous
 6. Sulphur
 7. Potassium
 8. Calcium
 9. Magnesium.
Macronutrients and Micronutrients in Plants

These include
• 1. Iron
• 2. Manganese
• 3. Copper
• 4. Molybdenum
• 5. Zinc
• 6. Boron
• 7. Chlorine and
• 8. Nickel
Macronutrients and Micronutrients in Plants
In addition to the 17 essential elements named above, there are some
beneficial elements such as
• 1. Sodium
• 2. Silicon
• 3. Cobalt and
• 4. Selenium.
They are required by higher plants.
• Nitrogen
 Nitrogen is required by all parts of a plant, particularly the
meristematic tissues and the metabolically active cells.
 Nitrogen is one of the major constituents of proteins, nucleic acids,
vitamins and hormones.
• Phosphorus
 Phosphorus is a constituent of cell membranes, certain proteins, all
nucleic acids and nucleotides, and is required for all phosphorylation
reactions.
Macronutrients and Micronutrients in Plants
• Potassium
 In plants, this is required in more abundant quantities in the
meristematic tissues, buds, leaves and root tips.
 Potassium helps to maintain an anion-cation balance in cells and is
involved in protein synthesis, opening and closing of stomata,
activation of enzymes and in the maintenance of the turgidity of cells.
• Magnesium
 It activates the enzymes of respiration, photosynthesis and are
involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA.
Macronutrients and Micronutrients in Plants
• Calcium
 Calcium is required by meristematic and differentiating tissues.
 During cell division it is used in the synthesis of cell wall, particularly
as calcium pectate in the middle lamella.
 It accumulates in older leaves.
 It is involved in the normal functioning of the cell membranes.
 It activates certain enzymes and plays an important role in regulating
metabolic activities.
Macronutrients and Micronutrients in Plants
HORMONES
• In plants, many behavioral patterns and functions are controlled by
harmones. These are controlled by harmones. These are “chemical
messengers” influencing many patterns of plant development.
• Plant Harmones - A natural substance(produced by plant) that acts
to control plant activities.
• Growth Regulators
 There are five recognized groups of natural plant harmones and
growth regulators.
o Auxin, Gibberellins, Cytokinins, Ethylene, Abscisic acid (ABA)
AUXINS
• It controls the growth of plants.
• Its formation takes place in apex part of the plant.
• It involves in plant growth, usually present at the dark side of the
shoot when light falls on the plant, leading to growth at the darker
side which causes bending of stem towards the light called
phototropism.
• Photo (light) and geotropism(gravity)- involved in tropism responses
– positive responses.
AUXINS
• Flower initiation and development
• Root initiation and development- used on cuttings to help stimulate
root growth.
• Example of Auxins are IAA (Indole Acetic Acid), NAA ( Napthalene
Acetic Acid)
• 2,4,D- 2,4, Dicholrophenoxyacetic acid
• 2,4,5,T- 2,4,5 Tricholrophenoxyacetic acid
• Both are herbicides.
GIBBERELLINS
• It contains Gibberellic acid, stimulates stem growth by cell division,
cell elongation and controls enzyme secretions. It also involved in
overcoming dormancy in seeds and buds.
• It turns the dwarf plants into long plants.
• Used commercially in:
 Increasing fruit size of seedless grapes
 Stimulating seed germination and seedling growth.
 Promoting male flowers in cucumbers for seed production.
CYTOKININS
• Promote cell division
• Found in all tissues with considerable cell division. Ex :
Embryos(seeds) and Germinating seeds, Young developing fruits.
• Tissue cultures use Cytokinins to induce shoot development.
• It may slow or prevent leaf senescence (leaf ageing or leaf fall).
ETHYLENE GAS
• It is used for the ripening of the fruit, produced in the actively
growing meristems of the plant, in senescing ripening or ageing
fruits.
• It promotes leaf senescing and abscission.
• Increases female flower in cucumbers (economically – will increase
fruit production).
INHIBITORS
• ABSCISIC ACID(ABA)
 It is present widely in plant body, moves readily through plant. It
counteracts the growth, promotes the effects of Auxins and
Gibberlins.
 It involves with leaf and fruit abscission (fall), onset of dormancy in
seeds and onset of dormancy (rest period) in perennial flowers and
shrubs.
 ABA is effective in including closure of stomata in leaves, indicating a
role in the stress physiology in plants. (Ex :Increases in ABA following
water, heat and high salinity stress to the plant).
Modes Of Reproduction in Plants
• There are several ways by which plants produce their offspring.
These are categorized into two types: (i) asexual, and (ii) sexual
reproduction.
• In asexual reproduction plants can give rise to new plants without
seeds, whereas in sexual reproduction, new plants are obtained
from seeds.
Asexual Reproduction in Plants
• Asexual reproduction occurs through:
 1. Vegetative Propagation,
 2. Budding,
 3. Fragmentation and
 4. Spore formation.
Vegetative Propagation
• Most plants have roots, stems and
leaves. These are called the vegetative
parts of a plant.
• Vegetative Propagation is a type of
asexual reproduction in which new
plants are produced from roots, stems,
leaves and buds.
• Since reproduction is through the
vegetative parts of the plant, it is known
as vegetative propagation.
• Bryophyllum (sprout leaf plant) has
buds in the margins of leaves. If a leaf of
this plant falls on a moist soil, each bud
can give rise to a new plant
Vegetative Propagation
• The roots of some plants can also give rise to new plants. Sweet
potato and dahlia are examples.
• Plants such as cacti produce new plants when their parts get
detached from the main plant body.
• Each detached part can grow into a new plant.
• Plants produced by vegetative propagation take less time to grow
and bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds.
• The new plants are exact copies of the parent plant, as they are
produced from a single parent.
Budding
• Yeast is a single-celled organism. The
small bulb-like projection coming
out from the yeast cell is called a
bud.
• The bud gradually grows and gets
detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell.
• The new yeast cell grows, matures
and produces more yeast cells.
• If this process continues, a large
number of yeast cells are produced
in a short time.
Fragmentation
• When water and nutrients are
available algae grow and multiply
rapidly by fragmentation.
• An alga breaks up into two or
more fragments.
• These fragments or pieces grow
into new individuals.
• This process continues and they
cover a large area in a short
period of time.
Spore formation
• Fungi on a bread piece grow from spores which are
present in the air. When spores are released they keep
floating in the air.
• The spores are asexual reproductive bodies. As they
are very light, they can cover long distances.
• Each spore is covered by a hard protective coat to
withstand unfavorable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So they can survive for
a long time. Under favorable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new individual.
• Plants such as moss and ferns also reproduce by
means of spores.

• Jointed exoskeleton (protection and support) –
made of 3 layers
 Outer: protein, lipid (waxy, repels water)
 Middle: protein, chitin (mainly
protection), some have CaCO3 too.
 Inner : protein, chitin(flexible at joints;
allows for movements; attach to muscles).
Phylum Arthropoda
• Body - Head, Thorax and Abdomen(three
parts).
• Respiration by gills, book lungs and trachea.
• Excretion by malpighian tubules.
• The body cavity is known as haemocoel
because it is filled with blood.
• Unisexual and fertilisation takes place inside
the body.
• Circulatory system: all have an open system -
heart pumps circulatory fluid through vessels
that empty into spaces in the body
• Nervous system: brain, nerves, compound eyes
(help as light detectors that each have lenses)
Phylum Arthropoda
• Molting : shedding of exoskeleton
• Some restaurants sell these freshly molted animals
“soft-shelled crabs”.
• Phylogeny of ARTHROPODS

 Hard chitin exoskeleton (must shed to grow)
 Circulatory system with blood, heart.
 Ex: Horshoe crab, Pycnogonida, lobster, crab,
shrimp

Later Mughals &
DECLINE OF MUGHAL
EMPIRE
By Dr Vipan Goyal

DECLINE OF MUGHAL EMPIRE
• Aurangzeb, the last Great Mughal emperor had-died and left his
Empire in chaos.
• The leadership that emerged was weak and ineffective.
• Therefore, from then onwards the Empire descended into anarchy
whenever an emperor was dead.
• It opened opportunities for not only the royal princes but also
whoever was influential enough to rule the Empire.
DECLINE OF MUGHAL EMPIRE
• A similar thought had taken shape in the minds of Zulfiqar khan &
Sayyid brothers (nobles in Mughal court) who witnessed the
ineffectiveness of the Mughal rulers before them.
• History is replete with such people who rise whenever a weakness
in the old leadership became apparent.
• Thus began the era of NOBLES in Indian history where rulers
became puppets and the real decision making power was with the
nobles.
FALL OF THE MUGHALS
• 1658 – 1707 - Aurangzeb
• 1707 – 1712 - Bahadur Shah (son of Aurangzeb)
• 1712 – 1713 - Jahandar Shah (Son of Bahadur Shah)
• 1713 – 1719 - Farrukhsiyar (nephew of Jahandar Shah)
• 1719 - Quick succession of two princes – Rafi-ud-daulah (Shah Jahan II)
and Rafi-ud-dar_Jat- Both of Whom died quickly
• 1719 – 1748 - Muhammad Shah-Rangeela (grandson of Bahadur Shah);
Delhi suffered the invasion of Nadir-Shah of Persia in 1739 during his reign
after which the disintegration was profound
FALL OF THE MUGHALS
• 1748 – 1754 - Ahmad Shah Bahadur (son of Muhammad Shah); the
emperor was deposed and blinded by his own Wazir Imad-ul-mulk who
placed Alamgir II on the thorne
• 1754 – 1759 - Alamgir II (second son of Jahandar Shah); Murdered by
conspiracy of Imad-ul-mulk and Maratha ruler Sadashivrao Bhau
• 1759 - Shahjahan III (grandson of Aurangzeb); deposed within a year
• 1759 - Shah Alam II (son of Alamgir II) came to the thorne but spent most
of the time away from Delhi. He was finally defeated by the british in
Battle of buxar in 1764.
BAHADUR SHAH (1707-1712)
• After 1707, with the death of tyrant and radical Aurangzeb, a fight among his
three sons for the thorne was witnessed and 65 year old Bahadur Shah came
out victorious.
• Unlike his father, Bahadur Shah was broad-minded, religiously tolerant and
was focused to make peace with the neighbouring states and not wages war.
• Bahadur Shah’s was supported by the Jat chief, Churaman in the campaign
against Sikhs.
• Struggle continued with the Sikhs till 1712 (the year in which Bahadur Shah
died).

• He assumed the title of Shah Alam I. He was also known as Shah-iBekhabar.
• He made peace with Guru Gobind Singh.
• He granted Sardeshmukhi to Marathas and also released Shahu.
• Due to the conciliatory behavior and reckless grants of Jagirs and
Zamindaris, the state finances deteriorated immensely in his reign.
(approx 13 crores in 5 years).
• Before he could take actions to improve the finances of the state, he died
in 1712, which once again put the state into Chaos and pitted nobles and
prince against each other to control power.
JAHANDAR SHAH (1712 - 1713)
• After Bahadur Shah’s death Jahandar Shah, one of the less abled sons
came to thorne with the help of ‘Zulfiqar Khan’ one of the nobles from
the times of Aurangzeb.
• Jahander Shah was weak and was too indulgent in his pleasures to take
control of the state. This gave opportunity to Zulfiqar khan to gain
control of Mughal affairs.
• He married a dancing girl who became his queen. He was attacked and
killed by his nephew and son-in-law Farrukhsiyar.
• First puppet Mughal Emperor. He abolished Jaziya
FARRUKHSIYAR (1713 – 1719)
• Farrukhsiyar accredited the success to Sayyid brothers- Abdullah Khan &
Hussain Ali Khan Barha.
• He made these two wazir (manager of home & finance) & Mir Bakshi
(manager of Army) respectively.
• The two brothers acquired control of the state with the most important
functions viz. controlling the army & finances.
• Farrukhsiyar was inefficient in ruling as he was not only a coward but
also lacked the capacity to control the Sayyid brothers.
• He executed Banda Bahadur.
Rafi ud-Darajat (1719 AD)
He sat on the throne with the help of Sayyid brothers in 1719
AD but could rule only for four months and died of some

disintegrated fast and independent kingdoms of Bengal, Awadh,
Hyderabad broke away from the empire.
• Muhammad Shah was installed as Mughal emperor by Sayyid
brothers who look de-facto control of the Empire in his name.
MUHAMMAD SHAH Rangilla (1719 – 1748)
• They needed to reform the administrative structure to take
effective control and consolidate their authority.
• Hence the brothers look following steps to reform the current
administrative structure.
• They:
 1. Took up the policy of religious tolerance as they were
convinced that India could be ruled harmoniously only by
associating with Hindu chiefs, nobles and common people.
MUHAMMAD SHAH Rangile (1719 – 1748)
 2. Sought to conciliate with Jats, Bundelas, Rajputs and

FALL OF SAYYID BROTHERS AND THE
DISINTEGRATION THEREAFTER
• With the growing animosity among nobles against Sayyid brothers,
there was a group, headed by Nizam-ul-mulk- Asaf Jah I (who later
became the first Nizam of the state of Hyderabad), who started
conspiring against them.
• With the killing of Farrukhsiyar, these nobles were convinced that if
the Emperor can be murdered then there was no security for the
commoners & even themselves.

Rise of
Maratha
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Rise of Maratha
• The Marathas had important positions in the administrative and military
systems of Ahmednagar and Bijapur.
• The Maratha ruler Shahji Bhonsle and his son, Shivaji, consolidated the
Maratha kingdom.
• Shahji acted as the kingmaker in Ahmednagar, and defied the Mughals.
• Taking advantage of the unsettled conditions, Shahji tried to set up a semiindependent principality at Bangalore, as Mir Jumla, the leading noble of
Golconda, tried to carve out such a principality on the Coromandal coast.
• Further, Shivaji’s attempted to carve out a large principality around Poona.
Shivaji
• Shivaji belonged to Bhonsle Clan. Shahji had left the Poona jagir to
his wife, Jija Bai and his minor son, Shivaji.
• Shivaji was brave and intellect since his childhood. When he was
merely 18 years old, he overran a number of hill forts near Poona—
Rajgarh, Kondana, and Torna in the years 1645-47.
• In 1647, after the death of his guardian, Dadaji Kondadeo, Shivaji
became his own master and the full control of his
father’s jagir came under his control.
Shivaji
• In 1656, Shivaji conquered Javli from the Maratha chief, Chandra
Rao More and started his reigning career.
• Guru Ramdas was his political Guru.
• His coronation was held at Raigarh in 1674. His kingdom was called
Swaraj.
• He adoped the titles of Chhatrapati, Haindava Dharmodharak &
Kshatriya Kulavatamsa.
Shivaji and the Mughals
• In 1657, the Mughal invasion of Bijapur saved Shivaji from Bijapur
reprisal.
• Shivaji first entered into negotiations with Aurangzeb and asked him
for the grant of all the Bijapur territories he held and other areas
including the port of Dabhol in the Konkan.
• Later Shivaji betrayed and changed his side.
• Shivaji resumed-his career of conquest at the expense of Bijapur.
• He burst into the Konkan, the coastal strip between the Western
Ghats and the sea, and seized the northern part of it.
Shivaji and the Mughals
• The ruler of Bijapur sent Afzal Khan and In 1659, Afzal Khan sent an
invitation to Shivaji for a personal interview, promising to get him
pardoned from the Bijapuri court.
• Convinced that this was a trap, Shivaji went with full preparation, and
murdered Afzal Khan.
• Shivaji captured all Afzal Khan’s property, including equipment and
artillery.
• Ultimately in 1662, the sultan of Bijapur made peace with Shivaji and
acknowledged him as an independent ruler of his conquered territories.
Shivaji and the Mughals
• Aurangzeb instructed Shaista Khan, the new Mughal governor of the Deccan to
kill him.
• Here shivaji attacked Shaista khan’s camp in night, injuring him.
• Then Aurangzeb sent Raja jai singh I of Amber who forced him to sign the treaty
of Purander in 1665.
• Under this treaty Shivaji had to surrender 23 of his major forts out of the total 35
forts.
• Shivaji also agreed to help the Mughals in their attack of Bijapur.
• Shivaji visited Agra with his son Sambhaji in 1666.
• There he was put on a house arrest. But he escaped from there, concealing in a
basket of sweets.
Shivaji and the Mughals
• He very soon conquered all the forts which he had surrended to the
Mughals.
• He was crownded in 1674 at Raigarh Fort and assumed the title of
Chhatarapati. He became the ruler of MHA.
• Ultimately Shivaji died in 1680 at the age of 53.
• Shivaji was succeeded by his son Sambhaji, who was captured by
Aurangzeb's forces in Deccan and executed while his son, Shahu
was taken prisoner.
Shivaji and the Mughals
• Shahu was released in 1707 by Bahadur Shah I and Marathas soon
began to make their presence felt.
• The states of Satara and Kolhapur were now created and Shahu
created the post of Sena-Karte (Organizer of Forces) and appointed
Balaji Vishwanath to the post. This evolved later into the office of
Peshwa (Prime Minister).

AGRICULTURE
By Dr Vipan Goyal

AGRICULTURE
• Agriculture is a primary economic activity that includes growing
crops, fruits, vegetables, flowers and rearing of livestock.
• Government’s Target is to Double the farmers’ income by 2022-23
• UN-SDG1: End poverty in all forms.
• UN-SDG2: Eliminate global hunger, protect indigenous seed and
crop varieties, doubling agriculture productivity and small farmer
incomes by 2030.
AGRICULTURE
• Sir Arthur Lewis’ Dual Economy Model : Economic development results in
labourers moving away from agriculture to the more productive industrial
sector, & agriculture sector becomes less important part GDP.
• The number of people employed in agriculture is steadily falling down:
55% (2011) to 42% (2018) (World Bank data).
• The share of agriculture in the total GDP is falling down, but not steadily.
Around 15.4 %
• The growth rate of agriculture has been zig zag due to El-Nino led drought
years.
Green Revolution
• Term was given by William Gaud
• Father of GR was Norman Baurlaug.
• Father of GR in India was M S Swaminathan.
• GR came in 3
rd five year plan ( 1966-67)
• Green revolution refers to the large increase in food production
with the help of High Yield Variety.
Green Revolution
• Phase-1: mid 1960s upto mid 1970s → focus on wheat, rice and
more affluent states such as Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil
Nadu.
• Phase-2: mid-1970s to mid-1980s → HYV seeds were spread to a
larger number of states and fo variety from just wheat and rice.
• Biofortification: is the process by which the nutritional quality of
food crops is increased. E.g. ICAR developed CR Dhan 310- a rice
variety that has higher protein & zinc content than traditional rice.
Genetically modified (GM) crops
• Hybrid seeds are developed by cross-breeding/cross-pollination
with other plants.
• Whereas, Transgenic/Genetically modified seeds are developed by
transferring selected genes from one organism into another.
• E.g. Bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis genes inserted in cotton → Bt.
cotton
• If bollworm pests eat it, they’ll die due to toxin crystals in the Bt
cotton plant.
BLUE REVOLUTION (for Fishes)
• Agro Ministry → Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries.
• Government gives money for modernization of boats, marketing & cold
storage infrastructure.
• National scheme for welfare of fishermen which gives money for
construction of houses, tube wells for drinking water etc.
• Promote Inland fisheries, aquaculture & pisciculture i.e. raising fish in
artificial tanks/ponds.
• Mariculture = cultivation of marine organisms in their natural environment
in sea upto 12 nautical miles from coast.
Other Revolutions
• WHITE REVOLUTION
 Father of White Revolution is Dr Verghese Kurien
 Agro Ministry → Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying &
Fisheries.
• “Pink Revolution” for meat and poultry industry, under Ministry of
food processing
• Yellow revolution in oilseed
• Golden for Horticulture
Other Revolutions
• Golden Fibers for Jute
• Silver for Eggs
• Silver Fibers for Cotton
• Black Revolution for Petroleum products.
• Brown Revolution for Leather/Cocoa/Non-Conventional Products.
• Grey Revolution for Fertilizers.
MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICES (MSP)
• Under the State APMC Acts, the first sale of agriculture commodity
can occur at Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)
Mandis only. However, a farmer may not get remunerative prices at
the Mandi due to following reasons:
 1. Bumper production /supply which brings down the market
prices AND / OR
 2. Cartelization / price-fixing by the mandi-merchants.
• So, to protect the farmers, Government of India announces MSP
before each crop sowing season.
MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICES (MSP)
• MSP covers 22 crops (MSP) + 1 sugarcane (FRP) = 23 viz.
• 14 kharif crops : Kharif: grown in summer / monsoon season.
• - paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, groundnut-inshell, soyabean, sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed and cotton;
• 6 rabi crops : - Rabi: grown in winter season. - wheat, barley, gram,
masur(lentil), rapeseed/mustard and safflower
• 3 commercial /cash crops : - Jute, copra and Sugarcane.
MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICES (MSP)
• For Sugarcane, mechanism is different: It requires the sugar mill
companies to pay the minimum Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP)
fixed by Govt. (Whereas for other 22, Govt itself procures at MSP)
• Agro Ministry’s Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices
recommends MSP (& FRP/Fair and Renumerative price) for sugar)
→ Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs)
• Procurement Price : The price at which govt is ready to buy the crop
from the farmer for buffer stock.
• Procurement Price is always higher than MSP.

Anglo Afghan War
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Anglo Afghan War
• Anglo-Afghan Wars, also called Afghan Wars, three conflicts
(1839–42; 1878–80; 1919) in which Great Britain from its base
in India, sought to extend its control over
neighbouring Afghanistan and to oppose Russian influence
there.
The First Anglo Afghan War: 1838-1842
• The Great Game involved Britain’s repeated attempts to
impose a puppet government in Kabul.
• The British wanted Dost Mohammad to break all contact
with the Iranians and Russians.
• and then an invasion of Afghanistan was ordered by the
governor-general of India, Lord Auckland, with the object
of restoring exiled Afghan ruler Shuja Shah to the throne.
• In 1838 Shuja Shah gained the support of the British and
Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost
Mohammad Khan. This was the Tripartite Treaty which
was signed in June 1838.
Tripartite Treaty 1838
• A tripartite treaty was signed between Ranjit Singh, Shah Shuja and Lord
Auckland in June 1838. This tripartite treaty was basically to help each other in
the time of need. The terms of this treaty were as follows:
1. Shah Shuja will be reinstated on the Throne
2. Sikh armies will provide army to Shah Shuja
3. Shah Shuja will determine the Foreign Policy with the advice of the
British.
4. Ranjit Singh’s claim on the right bank of Indus was recognized by Shah
Shuja.
5. Shah Shuja gave up claims on Sind.
6. British would remain in the background.
The First Anglo Afghan War: 1838-1842
• The above hotchpotch of Shah Shuja, British and Maharaja Ranjit Singh triggered First
Anglo Afghan War. The outcome of the war was as follows:
 After some resistance Dost Mohammed Khan surrendered to the British and Shuja
was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839.
 Dost Mohammad Khan was deported as a prisoner to Calcutta.
• The Afghanis took Shah Shuja as a betrayer and could not accept Shah Shuja as their
ruler. So, Shuja ud-Daula, leading the Afghan awam, sent Shah Shuja to hell on April 5,
1842.
• The killing of Shah Shuja also burst the balloon of the British Success, which seemed to
be an extraordinary initially. The Afghanis rose in rebellion and the victims of their wrath
were the British Political Agents who were cut into pieces.
The First Anglo Afghan War: 1838-1842
• Many British soldiers were killed in adverse cold.
• Thus the final outcome of this war was that a humiliating treaty was
signed by the British and the British were forced to recognize Dost
Mohammad as Emir of Afghanistan.
• Thus, the First Anglo Afghan War was a stupidity of Lord Auckland which
resulted in the death of thousands of British (Indian) soldiers and waste of
Crores of Rupees.
The First Anglo Afghan War: 1838-1842
• English Commanders murdered during this
period were Alexander Burns, Charles Burns,
Sir William Macnaughten & General
Elpinstone.
• The Afghan Policy of Lord Auckland was
criticized and he was replaced by Lord
Ellenborough in 1842.
• Lord Ellenborough was a lover of military
pomp and to seek an avenge, he ruined Kabul
and evacuated Afghanistan. Mohammad
Akbar, son of Dost Mohammad secured local
control.
Second Anglo Afghan War 1878-80
• The successive governments in Britain remain calm after the first war, but
when Lord Disraeli became PM, he sent Lord Lytton to India to increase
the influence in Afghanistan.
• On this side, under Akbar Khan, the son of Dost Mohammed, Afghanistan
once again became independent and Dost Mohammad Khan came back to
power in 1843. Akbar Khan died in 1845.
Treaty of Peshawar
• In 1855 Treaty of Peshawar between Dost Mohammad and British reopened
the diplomatic relations.
• After a series of incidents, Russia established a fixed boundary between
Afghanistan and its territories in 1873.
• But within a period of 5 years the rivalry turned back.
• This was because of an uninvited diplomatic mission sent by the Russians to
Kabul.
• The ruler Sher Ali Khan, son of Dost Mohammad Khan wanted to stop them,
but failed. The British too wanted to send a mission, but Sher Ali refused.
• A diplomatic mission was ordered by Lord Lytton, the viceroy of British India,
and the Mission was turned back. This triggered the Second Anglo Afghan War.
Treaty of Gandamak
• In the second Anglo Afghan war, much of Afghanistan was
occupied by British.
• Sher Ali was defeated and he fled towards Turkistan.
• Sher Ali’s Son, Mohammad Yaqub Khan signed a treaty of
Gandamak in May, 1879 to prevent British Invasion in rest
of the country.
• British Control was thus extended to much of the country.
He also agreed to receive a British Resident at Kabul.
• The treaty of Gandamak was signed in May, 1879, but in
the same year in September, the British Resident Major
Cavagnari was murdered. This again triggered the war and
Kabul was occupied. Yakub Khan surrendered and he was
sent to Dehradun as a Prisoner.
Third Anglo-Afghan War
• The First World War and the Russian Revolution of 1917 created a new
situation in Anglo-Afghan relations.
• The war gave rise to strong anti-British feeling in Muslim countries, and
the Russian Revolution inspired new anti-imperialist sentiments in
Afghanistan as, in fact, all over the world.
• The disappearance of Imperial Russia, moreover, removed the perpetual
fear of aggression from the northern neighbour, which had compelled
successive Afghan rulers to look to the British for support.
• The Afghans now demanded full Independence from British control.
Third Anglo-Afghan War
• Habibullah, who had succeeded
Abdul Rahman in 1901 as Amir,
was assassinated on 20 February
1919 and his son Amanullah, the
new Amir, declared open war on
British India in May 1921.
• Peace came in 1921 by a treaty,
Afghanistan recovered its
independence in foreign affairs.

Anglo Marathas
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Background and course
• The third Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao died in 1761 due to shock after his defeat
at the Third Battle of Panipat with Ahmed Shah Abdali.
• His son Madhav rao succeeded him. Madhav rao was able to recover some
of the Maratha power and territories which they had lost in the Battle of
Panipat.
• The English were aware of the growing Maratha power.
• When Madhavrao died, there was a tussle for power in the Maratha camp.
Background and course
• His brother Narayanrao became the Peshwa but his uncle Raghunath rao wanted to
become the Peshwa.
• For this, he sought the help of the English.
• So, the Treaty of Surat in 1775 was signed according to which Raghunath rao ceded
Salsette and Bassein to the English and in return he was given 2500 soldiers.
• The British and army of Raghunathrao attacked the Peshwa and won.
• The British Calcutta Council under Warren Hastings annulled this treaty and a new
treaty, the Treaty of Purandhar was signed in 1776 between the Calcutta Council and
Nana Phadnavis, a Maratha minister.
• Accordingly, Raghunathrao was given a pension only and Salsette was retained by
the British.
Background and course
• But the British establishment at Bombay violated this treaty and sheltered
Raghunathrao.
• In 1777, Nana Phadnavis went against his treaty with the Calcutta Council and
granted a port on the west coast to the French.
• This led the British to advance a force towards Pune.
• There was a battle at Wadgaon near Pune in which the Marathas under Mahadji
Shinde secured a decisive victory over the English.
• The English were forced to sign the Treaty of Wadgaon in 1779.
• There was a series of battles at the end of which the Treaty of Salbai was signed in
1782. This ended the first Anglo-Maratha war.
• This treaty helped the British to recover their territories from Hyder Ali by putting
pressure on Mysore with the help of Marathas.
Results of the First Anglo-Maratha War
• The East India Company retained Salsette and Broach.
• It also obtained a guarantee from the Marathas that they would retake
their possessions in the Deccan from Hyder Ali of Mysore.
• The Marathas also promised that they would not grant any more
territories to the French.
• Raghunath rao was to receive a pension of Rs.3 lakh every year.
• All territories taken by the British after the Treaty of Purandhar were
ceded back to the Marathas.
• The English accepted Madhavrao II (son of Narayanrao) as the Peshwa.
Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803 – 1805)
• After Tipu Sultan’s Mysore was captured by the British in 1799, the
Marathas were the only major Indian power left outside of British
domination.
• At that time, the Maratha Confederacy consisted of five major chiefs, the
Peshwas at Pune, the Gaekwads at Baroda, the Holkars at Indore, the
Scindias at Gwalior and the Bhonsles at Nagpur.
• There were internal squabbles among themselves.
Second Anglo-Maratha War
• Baji Rao II (son of Raghunathrao) was installed as the Peshwa after the
death of Madhavrao II.
• In the Battle of Poona in 1802, Yashwant rao Holkar, the chief of the
Holkars of Indore defeated the Peshwas and the Scindias.
• Baji Rao II sought British protection and signed the Treaty of Bassein in
1802 with them.
• As per this treaty, he ceded territory to the British and agreed to the
maintenance of British troops there.
Second Anglo-Maratha War
• This treaty was of great political advantage to the British and was an important
milestone in establishing their supremacy across the Indian subcontinent
• The Scindias and the Bhonsles did not accept this treaty and this caused the
second Anglo-Maratha war in central India in 1803.
• On December 17, 1803 the treaty of Deogaon was concluded between Raghuji
Bhonsle and the company.
• According to the terms of this treaty Bhonsle accepted the subsidiary alliance with
British and further agreed to cede the East India Company the province of Cuttack,
Balasore and territory west of the river Warda.
• The Holkars also joined the battle against the English at a later stage.
Result of Second Anglo Maratha War
• The Holkars signed the Treaty of Rajghat in 1805 according to which they gave
up Tonk, Bundi and Rampura to the British.
• The Scindias signed the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon in 1803 through which the
British got the territories of Rohtak, Ganga-Yamuna Doab, Gurgaon, Delhi Agra
region, Broach, some districts in Gujarat, parts of Bundelkhand and
Ahmadnagar fort.
• As a result of the war, large parts of central India came under British control. All
the Maratha forces were defeated by the British in these battles.
• However, the Holkar continued the war with British, the company entered into
peace treaty on 24 December 1805 known as the Rajpurghat Treaty.
Suppression of the Pindaris
• The first reference about the Pindari’s is during the Mughal invasion of Maharashtra.
• Pindaris did not belong to any particular caste or creed. They used to serve the army
without any payment but instead were allowed to plunder.
• During the time of Baji Rao I, they were irregular horsemen attached to the Maratha army.
It is worth mentioning that they never helped the British.
• They were mostly active in the areas of Rajputana and the Central Provinces and subsisted
on plunder.
• Their leaders belonged to both the Hindu as well as the Muslim communities. Chief
amongst them were Wasil Muhammad, Chitu and Karim Khan.
• In 1812, the Pindaris plundered the districts of Mirzapur and Shahabad and in 1815 they
raided the Nizam’s dominions.
Suppression of the Pindaris
• In 1816, they plundered the Northern Circars.
• Lord Warren Hastings himself took command of the force from the north while
Sir Thomas Hislop commanded the force from the south against the Pindaris.
• By 1818, the Pindaris were completely suppressed and all their bands
disintegrated.
• Karim Khan was given a small estate in the Gorakhpur district of the United
Provinces.
• Wasil Muhammad took refuge in the Scindia’s camp but the latter handed him
over to the British.
• Wasil committed suicide in captivity and Chitu escaped to the forest, where a
tiger killed him. Thus, by 1824, the menace of the Pindaris came to an end.
Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817 – 1818)
• By this time Lord Hastings was the Governor General (appointed in 1813) and he was
determined to proclaim British Paramountcy in India.
• After the second Anglo-Maratha war, the Marathas made one last attempt to rebuild their
old prestige.
• They wanted to retake all their old possessions from the English.
• They were also unhappy with the British residents’ interference in their internal matters.
• The chief reason for this war was the British conflict with the Pindaris whom the British
suspected were being protected by the Marathas.
• The Maratha chiefs Peshwa Bajirao II, Malharrao Holkar and Mudhoji II Bhonsle forged a
united front against the English.
• Daulatrao Shinde, the fourth major Maratha chief was pressured diplomatically to stay away.
• But the British victory was swift.
Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817 – 1818)
• At the end of the third Anglo-Maratha War Peshwa Bajirao II, was
dethroned and pensioned. He was sent to Bithur, a place near Kanpur. All
his territory was annexed by the British.
• His adopted son, Nana Saheb became one of the leaders of the Revolt of
1857 at Kanpur.
• The territories annexed from the Pindaris became the Central Provinces
under British India.
• Marathas were inferior to the English in terms of military organization and
leadership, diplomacy, political consolidation and economic policy which
ultimately caused their defeat.
Results of Third Anglo-Maratha War
• The Treaty of Gwalior was signed in 1817 between Shinde and the British,
even though he had not been involved in the war.
• As per this treaty, Shinde gave up Rajasthan to the British. The Rajas of
Rajputana remained the Princely States till 1947 after accepting British
sovereignty.
• The Treaty of Mandasor was signed between the British and the Holkar chief
in 1818. An infant was placed on the throne under British guardianship.
• This war led to the end of the Maratha Empire. All the Maratha powers
surrendered to the British.
Reasons for Maratha Loss
• Lack of unity among the Maratha chiefs themselves.
• Lack of good relations with other Indian princes and ruling dynasties.
• Failure to understand the British political and diplomatic strengths.

Anglo Mysore
By Dr Vipan Goyal

ANGLO-MYSORE WARS
• The Anglo-Mysore Wars were a series of four wars between the
British and the Kingdom of Mysore in the latter half of the
18th century in Southern India.
 Hyder Ali (1721 – 1782)
• Started his career as a soldier in the Mysore Army.
• Soon rose to prominence in the army owing to his military
skills.
• He was made the Dalavayi (commander-in-chief), and later the
Chief Minister of the Mysore state under Krishnaraja Wodeyar
II, ruler of Mysore.
• Through his administrative prowess and military skills, he
became the de-facto ruler of Mysore with the real king reduced
to a titular head only.
• He set up a modern army and trained them along European
lines.
ANGLO-MYSORE WARS
• Hyder Ali strengthened his army by including French
soldiers into his service.
• In 1755, established modern arsenal in Dindigul/TN with
French help.
• He extended his territories by conquering many areas in
South India including Bidnur, Sunda, Sera, Canara, and
Malabar to gain access to Indian Ocean.
• In 1766 Mysore began to be drawn into territorial and
diplomatic disputes between the Nizam of Hyderabad
and the British East India Company, which had by then
become the dominant European colonial power on the
Indian east coast.
First Mysore War (1767-1769)
• The first Anglo-Mysore war started with attack of Marathas on Mysore in 1766, but
Hyder Ali made peace with Marathas paying them 35 lakh Rupees.
• After Marathas returned, Nizam attacked Mysore with the assistance of British. But even

Hyder Ali.
• The English forces could not retaliate and retreated to Trichinopoly under Col. Smith.
• Later Col. Wood joined the British army and amid confusion, Hyder Ali retreated from
the battle. Now the British threatened to attack Hyderabad.
• This forced the Nizam to sign a treaty in 1768. As per the terms of this treaty the Nizam
agreed to abide by the treaty signed with British in context with the Northern Circars.
• Hyder Ali was regarded as usurper and was refused to be acknowledge as ruler of
Mysore, Nizam agreed to help the British to punish Hyder Ali.
First Mysore War (1767-1769)

Rights of Mysore when Hyder Ali was ousted and Mysore is won by him.
• Hyder Ali was defeated at Changam and Tiruvannamalai in 1767.
• At the same time Tipu Sultan, son of Hyder Ali advanced towards Madras and the

continued the war with the British for two more years.
• The war came to an end with the Treaty of Mangalore signed in 1784. Both sides
agreed to exchange the captured territories and war prisoners and thus the war
ended up without any concrete results.

• Tipu once said “One day of life of a tiger is far better than thousand years
of living as a sheep.”
Third Mysore War (1790-92)
• The Treaty of Mangalore (1784) exhibited the military strength of Mysore,
exposed English weaknesses and increased Tipu’s strength.
• Further, Tipu strengthened his position by undertaking various internal
reforms.
• All above mentioned factors created worries to the British, the Nizam of
Hyderabad and the Marathas.
• Moreover, Tipu made attempts to seek the help of France and Turkey by
sending envoys to those countries. He also expanded his territories at the
cost of his neighbours, particularly the Raja of Travancore, who was an ally
of the British.
Third Mysore War (1790-92)
• In 1789, the British concluded a tripartite alliance with the Nizam and the
Marathas against Tipu.
• Lord Cornwallis who had been made the Governor General of Bengal and
the Commander-in-Chief of the English army then declared a war on Tipu
in 1790.
• Cornwallis himself assumed command of the war in December 1790.
• Cornwallis captured Bangalore in March 1791, but Tipu’s brilliant
strategies prolonged the war and he was forced to retreat to Mangalore
due to lack of provisions.
Third Mysore War (1790-92)
• In the mean time aid from the Marathas helped Cornwallis to resume his
campaign attack against Srirangapattinam again.
• Swiftly the English forces occupied the hill forts near Srirangapattinam and
seized it in February 1792.
• Tipu Sultan concluded the Treaty of Srirangapattinam with the British.
• As per treaty Tipu had to give up half of his dominions. He had to pay a
war indemnity of three crore rupees and surrender two of his sons as
hostages to the English.

obtained the Baramahal district and Dindigal.
Fourth Mysore War (1799)
• The Treaty of Srirangapattinam failed to bring peace between Tipu Sultan
and the British.
• Tipu Sultan sent emissaries to Kabul, Constantinople, Arabia and France to
get their support.
• At this juncture that Wellesley tried to revive the Triple Alliance of 1790
with the Marathas.
• Though his proposal was not accepted by the Marathas, they promised to
remain neutral.
• However, a Subsidiary Alliance with the Nizam was concluded by the
British and as a consequence, the French force at Hyderabad was
disbanded.
Fourth Mysore War (1799)
• Wellesley set out to persuade Tipu to accept a pact of subsidiary alliance
and wrote letters requesting the Tipu to dismiss the French, to receive an
English envoy, and to make terms with the Company and its allies.

Anglo Sindh and
Anglo Sikh War
By Dr Vipan Goyal

2nd Phase of British East India Company
• Lord William Bentinck was the first Governor-General to visualise a
Russian threat to India and because of this, he was eager to negotiate
friendly relations both with the rulers of Punjab, Maharajah Ranjit Singh
and also with the Amirs of Sind.
• His earnest desire was that Afghanistan should be made a buffer state
between India and any possible invader.
• As an initial measure, an exchange of gifts took place between Lahore, the
capital of Punjab and Calcutta, made the seat of Governor-General.
2nd Phase of British East India Company
• It was then followed by the meeting of Bentinck and Ranjit Singh on 25
October, 1831 at Ropar on the bank of the river Sutlej amidst show and
splendor.
• The Governor-General was successful in winning the friendship of Ranjit
Singh and the Indus Navigation Treaty was concluded between them.
• This treaty opened up the Sutlej for navigation. In addition, a commercial
treaty was negotiated with Ranjit Singh. A similar treaty was also
concluded with the Amirs of Sind
THE CONQUEST OF SINDH
• The conquest of Sindh occurred as a result of the growing Anglo-Russian rivalry in Europe
and Asia and the consequent British fears that Russia might attack India through
Afghanistan or Persia.
• To counter Russia, the British Government decided to increase its influence in Afghanistan
and Persia.
• It further felt that this policy could be successfully pursued only if Sindh was brought
under British control. The commercial possibilities of the river Sindh were an additional
attraction. The road and rivers of Sindh were opened to British trade by a treaty in 1832.
• The chiefs of Sindh, known as Amirs, were made to sign a subsidiary treaty in 1839 and
finally, Sindh was annexed in 1843 after a brief campaign by Sir Charles Napier.
ANGLO-SIKH WARS
• The death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in June 1839 was followed by political
instability and rapid changes of government in the Punjab. The British
officials increasingly talked of having to wage a campaign in the Punjab.
• Sikh Wars, (1845-46; 1848-49), two campaigns fought between the Sikhs
and the British.
• They resulted in the conquest and annexation by the British of the Punjab
in northwestern India.
• The British pursued the policy of encirclement of Punjab from 1833
onwards and the annexation of Sindh by the British in 1843 confirmed the
suspicions of the Sikh and the first Anglo-Sikh War started soon after in
1845.
First War (1845-1846)
• The Sikh army was soon defeated under Lal Singh (P.M.) by Sir Hugh Gough at Mudki in 1845.
• The British also defeated the Sikh army under Tej Singh, Commander-in-Chief at Ferozepur in
1845.
• However, the British under Harry Smith suffered a blow at the hands of Ranjur Singh Majhithia
at Buddewal in 1846.
• Finally the Sikhs were defeated by Smith at Aliwal and Sobroan (1846) on the crossing of the
Sutlej and Lahore was occupiered by the British.
• The War ended with the Treaty of Lahore in 1846. Jullundar Doab was ceded to the British and
payment of a war indemnity of Rs. 1.5 crore was also imposed on the Sikhs.
• But they were able to pay only half of this amount and for the rest the British got Kashmir
which they sold to Gulab Singh.
• A British resident, Sir Henry Lawrence was appointed at Lahore and Dalip Singh was recognized
as the ruler of Punjab with Rani Jindan as his regent.
First War (1845-1846)
• Soon after the Treaty of Bhairowal was signed in December 1846 which
resulted in the removal of Rani Jindan and setting up of a Council of
Regency for Punjab (consisting of 8 Sikh Sardars and presided over by Sir
Henry Lawrence.)
Second War (1848-1849)
• Desire of the Sikh army to avenge their humiliation of the first war and the
discontentment of the Sikh Sardars with the British control over Punjab
was the underlying cause of second Anglo-Sikh war.
• Treatment of Rani Jindan by the British – her transportation to Shaikpur
first and then to Benaras and the drastic reduction in her pension also
fuelled the Sikh sentiments.
Second War (1848-1849)
• The Second Sikh War began with the revolt of Mulraj, Governor of Multan, in April 1848
and became a national revolt when the Sikh army joined the rebels on September 14.
• Indecisive battles characterized by great ferocity and bad generalship were fought at
Ramnagar (November) and at Chilianwala (Jan 1849) before the final British victory at
Gujarat (February 1849).
• The Sikh army surrendered in March 12, and Punjab was annexed by Lord Dalhousie and
Dalip Singh disposed and pensioned off to England along with Rani Jindan.
• A Board of Three Commissioners consisting of the Lawrence brothers – Henry and John
and Charles G. Mansel was constituted in 1849 to administer Punjab.
• Soon afterwards the Board was abolished and a Chief Commissioner for Punjab, Sir John
Lawrence was appointed in 1853.

Anglo-French Rivalry
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Anglo-French Rivalry
• In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the
English and the French were competing with each
other to establish their supremacy in India.
• Both of them used the political turmoil prevalent in
India as a result of the decline of the Mughal Empire
and they indulged in internal politics.
• The Anglo-French rivalry in India was manifest in the
Carnatic region and in Bengal.
• Note : Carnatic region (of peninsular South India
lying between the Eastern Ghats and the Western
Ghats, in the modern Indian states of Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh.)
First Carnatic War (1746-1748)
• The downfall of the Mughal Empire led to the
independence of Deccan under Nizam-ul-Mulk.
• The Carnatic region also formed part of the Nizam’s
dominion.
• The ruler of the Carnatic accepted the suzerainty of
the Nizam.
• In 1740, the Austrian War of Succession broke out in
Europe.
• In that war England and France were in the opposite
camps. They came into conflict in India also.
First Carnatic War (1746-1748)
• The French governor of Pondicherry, Dupleix
opened attack on the English in 1746 and thus
began the First Carnatic War (1746-1748).
• The English sought help from the Nawab of
Carnatic, Anwar Uddin.
• But the French concluded a treaty with his rival
Chanda Sahib.
• The English army crushed a defeat on the French in
the Battle of Adyar, near Madras.
• In the meantime, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle
was concluded in 1748 to end the Austrian
Succession War. Thus the First Carnatic War came
to an end.
Second Carnatic War (1749-1754)
• But the English and French continued
to take opposite sides in the internal
politics of India which resulted in the
Second Carnatic War (1749-1754).
• Dupleix supported the cause of
Muzafar Jang, who wanted to become
the Nizam of Hyderabad and Chanda
Sahib, an aspirant for the throne of
Arcot/TN.
Second Carnatic War (1749-1754)
• The troops of Muzafar Jang, Chanda Sahib
and Dupleix defeated Anwar Uddin, who
was with the British in the First Carnatic
War, and killed him in the Battle of Ambur in
1749.
• After this victory, Muzafar Jung became the
Nizam and Chanda Sahib the Nawab of
Arcot.
• Muhammad Ali, son of Anwar Uddin
escaped to Tiruchirappalli.
• The English sent troops in support of him.
Second Carnatic War (1749-1754)
• In the meantime, the British commander Robert Clive captured Arcot from
Chanda Sahib.
• Chanda Sahib was captured and beheaded in Tanjore. Meanwhile Dupleix
was replaced by Godeheu as the French governor.
• The war came to an end by the Treaty of Pondicherry in 1754.
Third Carnatic War (1758-1763)
• The outbreak of the Seven Years War (1756-1763) in Europe led to the
Third Carnatic War (1758-1763).
• Count de Lally was the commander of the French troops.
• The British General Sir Eyre Coote defeated him at Wandiwash/TN in 1760.
• In 1761, Pondicherry was captured and destroyed by the British troops.
Third Carnatic War (1758-1763)
• The Seven Years War came to an end by the Treaty of Paris in 1763 and
with it the third Carnatic War also ended.
• The French agreed to confine its activities in Pondicherry, Karaikal, Mahe
and Yanam.
• Thus the Anglo-French rivalry came to a close with British success and
French failure.
Causes for the French failure
• The English were commercially and as a naval power were superior to French.
• There was lack of support to the French’s from their government and there
was difference of opinion between the French Generals.
• French had support only in the Deccan but the English had a strong base in
Bengal.
• English had three important ports – Calcutta, Bombay and Madras but French
had only Pondicherry.
• England’s victory in the European wars decided the destiny of the French in
India.

Aryans, Early Vedic
and Later Vedic Period
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Advent of Aryans
• Aryans a Linguistic Group
• It was initially proposed by the German scholar Max
Muller that Aryans belonged to a race. Aryan means
language and nothing but language. It is now accepted
that Aryan was not a race but was basically a linguistic
group.
• Sanskrit was the language of Aryans
Aryans a Linguistic Group
• In 1786, Sir William Jones, in his famous address to the
Asiatic society of Bengal, tried to prove definite relation
between the Vedic Sanskrit and some of the principle
languages of Europe and Asia
• The scholars have given a common name Indo-European to
this group of languages and the people speaking them were
known as the Indo-Europeans or Indo-Aryans.
Aryans a Linguistic Group
• On this basis it has been surmised that Aryans spoke
the common language and shared the common
home, dispersed or emigrated to various parts of the
world, including India.
• The Aryan migration of India is recorded in no
written document, and it cannot yet be traced
archaeologically,
Advent of Aryans
• Some say they originated from the area
around the Caspian Sea in Central Asia
(Max Muller) (Most accepted theory),
while others think they originated from
the Russian Steppes.
• Bal Gangadhar Tilak was of the opinion
that the Aryans came from the arctic
region.
• The holy book of Iran ‘Zend Avesta’
indicates entry of Aryans to India via Iran
Advent of Aryans
• The Vedic Age started with the
Aryan occupation of the IndoGangetic Plains.
• Meaning of the word Arya: Noble.
• They led a rural, semi-nomadic
life as compared to the Indus
Valley people who were
urbanised.
• It is believed that they entered
India through the Khyber Pass.
Advent of Aryans
• Aryans called Indus valley “Sapt Sindavah” i.e. land of
7 rivers with river Indus (Sindhu) most mentioned in
Rig Veda
• Saraswati (Naditarna) is mentioned as the holiest
river in Rig Veda, named after Harakwati (Hemland
river) in south Afganistan
Advent of Aryans
• Society was mainly male
dominated; women were
treated with dignity and
honour
• Early life in this period
seems to be mainly pastoral
with agriculture being the
secondary occupation
• Domesticated horses to ride
Aryan Conflicts
• The first batch of Aryans invaded India 1500 B.C.
• They got into conflicts with the autochthonous inhabitants of
India, i.e. the dasas or dasyus.
• While the Dasas did not provoke much violence from the
Aryans.
• Dasyuhatya or the slaughter of Dasyus is frequently
mentioned in the Rig Veda.
• The mention of the Pre-Aryan forts could have been of
Harappan settlements.
Aryan Conflicts
• The Aryans were easily able to
conquer the natives as they
possessed better arms, coats of
mail (varman) and chariots
driven by horses.
• The Aryans engaged in two types
of conflicts: one with the
indigenous populations and then
among themselves.
• The Aryans were divided into five
tribes called Panchajanas and
sometimes procured the help of
non-Aryans as well.
Aryan Conflicts
• The rulers of Aryan clan were Bharata and Tritsu assisted by
priest Vasishtha Viswamitra.
• The country Bharatvarsha was named after the king Bharata.
• Aryans succeeded everywhere because they possessed
chariot driven by horses.
The Dasarajan War
• India was ruled by the Bharata clan and faced
opposition from ten kings; five Aryans and five
non-Aryans.
• Sudas a Bharata king of the Tritsu family and the
confederacy of ten well-known tribes- Puru, Yadu,
Turvasa, Anu, Druhyu, Alina, Paktha, Bhalanas,
Shiva and Vishanin. The former five are said to be
Aryan tribe while the later 5 are said to be NonAryan tribes.
• The battle fought amongst them is called the
battle of ten kings or the Dasarajan war.
• Fought on the river parushni or ravi, the battle
was won by the sudas.
Battle of 10 Kings fought at River Parushni (Ravi)
• The Purus were another very important tribe in the days of
the Rig-Veda. They were closely connected with Tritsus and
the Bharatas, and lived on either side of the Saraswati.
The Anus, Druhyus, Yadus and Turvasas were the allies of
the Purus against the Bharatas. These five are the five
peoples (Panchjanah) fo the Rig-Veda. The Name Yadu and
Turvasa normally occur together in the
• Bharat clan emerged victorious & subsequently joined
hand with Purus & formed a new ruling tribe called kurus.
• In the later Vedic times, the Kurus and the Panchalas
played an important role in the politics of the upper
gangetic plains where they established their rule together.
• Bharatvansa is named after tribe Bharata & 1
st mentioned
in Rig Veda.
Early Vedic Period (1500-1000 BC)
• Age of Rig Veda
 Vedas means to know –
Superior knowledge
 Veda does not mean to be
the mantras or samhitas or
sholkas only.
 It is knowledge and
conscience.
 Avesta which is the oldest
Zoroastrian Text has shown
some similarity with Rig Veda.
Rig Veda
• Earliest text of Indo European language
• Collection of Hymns (Suktiyan). Were recited at the time of
sacrificial rites and other rituals.
• Contains 1028 hymns.
• Contains prayers offered to Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna & other
gods
• Consists of 10 mandalas or books with 2 – 7 being the earliest
one called family books & 1 and 10 being the latest editions
Rig Veda
• 3
rd Mandal consists of Gayatri mantra
(Composed by viswamitra to offer
prayer to solar deity Savitri)
• Saraswati is the deity river in Rigveda.
• Many things in common with Avesta
(oldest Iranian text – Zoroastrian ).
• 10th Mandala contains Purushsukta
which explains that the varnas
(Brahamans, Kshatriya, Vaisheya and
Shudra) were born from mouth, arms,
thighs, and feet of the creator Brahma.
Rig Veda
• Words in Rig Veda : Om 1028 times, Jan 275 times, 250 hymns are
dedicated to Indra while 200 are dedicated to Agni.
• Agriculture was well known to pre aryans & ploughshare is
1
st mentioned in early part of Rig Veda
• But agriculture was perhaps used to produce fodder only.
• Predominantly pastoral people with cattle rearing as main
occupation
• Most of the wars were fought for the sake of cows as the term for
war in Rig Veda is Gavishthi i.e. search for cows (Hence cows seems
to have been most important wealth)
Rig Veda
• Gifts were made to priests in form of cows & women slaves and Not
in form of land
• Rig Veda mentions several artisans namely Carpenters, Chariot
makers, weavers, Leather workers, Potters etc. along with term
Ayas used for copper or Bronze which shows metal working was
well known
• Aryans or Vedic people mainly relied on land routes as the word
samundra mentioned in Rig veda mainly denotes a collection of
water
Rig Vedic term Meaning
Gau Cow
Gavishti Search for Cows
Gopati Raja or chief, protector of cows
Godhuli Measure of time
Duhitr Daughter or one who milks the cows
Gomat wealthy man who owned many cattle
Rivers in Vedic Age
• The term ‘Sapta Sindhu’ or the group of
seven chief rivers is mentioned in the Rig
Veda.
• The seven rivers were probably:
 Saraswati in the east, Sindhu (Indus) in the
west, Satudri (Sutlej), Vipasa (Beas), Asikni
(Chenab), Parushni (Ravi) and Vitasta
(Jhelum)
 The Discovery of Boghaz-Koi inscription (Asia
Minor, Turkey) (of 14th century B.C.)
mentioned Rig Vedic deities that the Rig
Veda existed earlier and the culture migrated
from India to Asia Minor in that early age.
Similarities between Rig Vedic and
Harappan Civilizations
• The geographical distribution of
the Harappan sites can be seen in the light of Rig
Vedic geography as well.
• The geographical features, mentioned in the Rig
Veda, confirms the extension of Vedic Civilization
from Afghanistan in the north to Gujarat in the
south, Ganga in the east to Kubha (Kabul) in the
west.
• The Rig Vedic culture was flourished in the area
around the Saraswati river and its tributaries;
more than 80% of the Harappan settlements are
found around the Saraswati valley thus it was the
main area of Harappan civilization.
Similarities between Rig Vedic and
Harappan Civilizations
• The animals known to the Indus people are also
known to the Rig Veda, including sheep, dog,
buffalo, bull, etc.
• The animals hunted by the Rig Vedic people were
antelopes, boars, buffalos (gaur), lions, and
elephants most of them were also familiar to the
Indus people.
• A Terracotta Figurine of Horse found from Lothal.
The horse was an important animal in the Vedic
period. Horse bones and terracotta figurines
have been found at some Harappan sites as well.
Similarities between Rig Vedic and
Harappan Civilizations
• The Harappan people were aware of using ornaments like
earrings, necklaces, bracelets, anklets, garlands, and jewels.
• Rig Veda mentions the use of gold
and ayas (copper). Ayas was used in making of vessels.
• The above-discussed similarities found between the Rig Vedic
and Harappan civilization have led to the conclusion that
the Harappan civilization is the same as the Vedic
civilization and the Aryans did not come to India from
outside.
Political structure
• The political structure of Rig Vedic India can be
studied in the following ascending order:
 The Family (Kula), the smallest unit.
 The Village (Grama)
 The Clan (Vis) formed a tribe.
 The People (Jana)
 The Country (Rashtra)
Political structure
• Kula (family) included all the people living under the same roof
(griha). And Kulapa was the head.
• A collection of several families constitutes the grama (village) and
its headman was called gramini.
• The collection of several grama (village) was called as the Vis and its
head was called Vispati.
• Several Vis constituted a Jana as it is mentioned as Panchajanah,
Yadva-janaha, and Bharata-janaha.
• The aggregation of all Jana constitutes Rashtra (country).
Political structure
• Monarchical form of government with a king known as Rajan/
Tribal chief at the center
• King was known as Gopaljanya i.e. protector of its people &
cows
• King was assisted by Purohits, Senani (leader of army) &
Gramanis.
• No regular standing army.
Political structure

Narsimham Committee
• The Narsimham-II Committee was tasked with the progress review
of the implementation of the banking reforms since 1992 with the
aim of further strengthening the financial institutions of India.
• It focused on issues like size of banks and capital adequacy ratio
among other things. M. Narasimham, Chairman, submitted the
report of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Committee-II)
to the Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in April 1998.
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)
• Non-Performing assets are those an asset on which loan or interest remains
pending for over 90 days
• According to RBI, terms loans on which interest or installment of principal remain
overdue for a period of more than 90 days from the end of a particular quarter is
called a Non-performing Asset. However, in terms of Agriculture / Farm Loans; the
NPA is defined as under:
• For short duration crop agriculture loans such as paddy, Jowar, Bajra etc. if the loan
(installment/interest) is not paid for 2 crop seasons , it would be termed as a NPA.

borrower giving him 60 days to pay his dues. If the dues are not
paid, the bank can take possession of the assets and can also give it
on lease or sell it; as per provisions of the SAFAESI Act.
BASEL Norms
• Basel Norms were established by Bank for International
Settlements in 1930.
• It is the Bank of Central Banks as only Central Banks can be its
members.
• In 1988 Basel Norms established a committee on Banking
Supervision.
 Objective of this committee is to recommend various norms which
should be adopted by the Central Banks to regulate banking sector.

 These norms were revised in 2004 and into Basel II
 These norms were further revised in 2010 into Basel III
BASEL Norms
• Focus of Basel Norms is to ensure Capital Adequacy
• Basel III was released in December, 2010 under the title
• Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement,
standards and monitoring
• The revised version was released in 2011 under the title
• Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks
and banking systems - revised version June 2011
CAPITAL
• Tier I Capital (Core Capital)
 It includes pure equity capital
 Equity means share thus it includes Share Capital (Paid up Capital)
 It also includes Undistributed Profits (Reserves)
 It includes Preference shares
• Tier II Capital (Supplementary Capital)
 Mixture of equity & Debt Capital
 E.g. - subordinated debt
Major Changes
• Capital Conservation Buffer:
• now banks will be required to hold a capital conservation buffer of
2.5%. The aim of asking to build conservation buffer is to ensure
that banks maintain a cushion of capital that can be used to absorb
losses during periods of financial and economic stress.
• In India, RBI announced that Banks will adopt Basel III norms from
April 1, 2013 and will be fully adopted by 2018.
Major Changes
• Minimum Common Equity and Tier 1 Capital Requirements: The
minimum requirement for common equity, the highest form of lossabsorbing capital, has been raised under Basel III from 2% to 4.5%
of total risk-weighted assets.
• The overall Tier 1 capital requirement, consisting of not only
common equity but also other qualifying financial instruments, will
also increase from the current minimum of 4% to 6%.
• Although the minimum total capital requirement will remain at the
current 8% level, yet the required total capital will increase to
10.5% when combined with the conservation buffer.
Major Changes
• Leverage Ratio:
• A leverage ratio is the relative amount of capital to total assets (not
risk-weighted).
• This aims to put a cap on swelling of leverage in the banking sector
on a global basis.
• 3% leverage ratio of Tier 1 will be tested before a mandatory
leverage ratio is introduced in January 2018.

 Partition of Bengal into West Bengal & East Bengal
 Announced on 7 July 1905 by Viceroy Curzon
 Implemented on 16 October 1905
 The new province of East Bengal and Assam included the whole of Assam
and the Dacca, Rajshahi and Chittagong divisions ,with headquarters at
Dacca.
 Partition divided the Hindus & Muslims of Bengal
 The official reason given for the decision was that Bengal with a population
of 78 million (about a quarter of the population of British India) had become
too big to be administered.
 This was true to some extent

Curzon’s real motives were –
 To break the growing strength of Bengali nationalism since Bengal was
the base of Indian nationalism.
 To divide the Hindus and Muslims in Bengal.
 To show the enormous power of the British Government
 It led to the anti-partition agitation and Swadeshi Movement
 It provided the spark for the rise of extremism in the Indian National
Movement.
 The partition animated the Hindus and led the Muslims to form their own
national organisation on communal lines – Muslim League
 The Muslims in East Bengal hoped that a separate region would give them
more control over education and employment, hence, they opposed those
movements
 Bengal was reunited in 1911 in an effort to appease Bengali sentiment
(Announced by Lord Hardinge at Delhi Durbar)
 A new partition which divided the province on linguistic, rather than
religious grounds followed
 Hindi, Oriya and Assamese areas were separated to form separate
administrative units
 Bihar and Orissa Province was created to the west
 Assam Province to the east.
 On the same day when the partition came into effect, 16 October 1905, the
people of Bengal organised protest meetings and observed a day of mourning.
 The whole political life of Bengal underwent a change.
 Rabindranath Tagore suggested to observe the day as ‘Rakhi bandhan day’ to
show unity and brotherhood of Bengal
 Gandhi wrote that the ‘’real awakening in India took place only after the
Partition of Bengal.’’
 The anti-partition movement culminated into the Swadeshi Movement and
spread to other parts of India (intensity was less in rest of India)
 The Swadeshi Movement had its genesis in the anti-partition movement
which was started to oppose the British decision to partition Bengal.
 The Indian National Congress, meeting in 1905 at Benares under the
presidency of G.K. Gokhale, resolved to :-
 condemn the partition of Bengal and the reactionary policies of Curzon
 support the anti-partition movement (but not the extreme tactics of
boycott)
 The militant nationalists, led by LAL, BAL, PAL and Aurobindo Ghosh
wanted the movement to be taken outside Bengal to other parts of the
country and go beyond a boycott of foreign goods to become a fullfledged political mass struggle with the goal of attaining Swaraj.
But the Moderates, dominating the Congress at that time, were not
willing to go that far.
*The extremist faction was officially formed by Tilak and INC was almost split
at the session . But ultimately, Tilak and others decided to work as a faction
within the Congress itself.
 However, aggressive nationalists forced Dadabhai Naoroji, the
president, to speak of Swaraj (which was not a Moderate demand) in
the Calcutta Session of Congress in 1906
 The Extremist emboldened by Dadabhai Naoroji’s declaration gave a
call for passive resistance in addition to Swadeshi and boycott of
foreign goods
 This included boycott of government schools and colleges, government
service, courts, legislative councils, municipalities, government titles,
etc.
 It was both a political and an economic movement
 Involved programmes like the boycott of government service, courts, schools
and colleges and of foreign goods
 Promotion of Swadeshi goods
 Promotion of National Education through the establishment of national
schools and colleges
 Landlords, Women and students actively participated & Students refused
using books made of foreign paper
 Absence of participation of Peasants as well as industrialists
**It was the first mass movement in the history of India’s struggle for
Independence
 Some of the Muslim leaders who participated—Barrister Abdul Rasul, Liaqat
Hussain, Guznavi, Maulana Azad
 But most of the upper and middle class Muslims stayed away or, led by Nawab
Salimullah of Dacca, they supported the partition on the plea that it would give
them a Muslim-majority East Bengal
 To further government interests, the All India Muslim League was propped up in
1906 as an anti-Congress front
The government adopted several tough measures against the
movement
 It passed several Acts to crush the movement.
 The Swadeshi volunteers were beaten badly.
 The popular cry of Bande Mataram was forbidden.
 Schools and colleges were warned not to allow their students to take part in
the movement or else, their aid would be stopped.
 Some Indian government employees lost their jobs.
 Extremist leaders Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal
and Aurobindo Ghosh were imprisoned and deported
NOTE - Poem Vande Mataram
Anandmath,1882 – book by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay based on Sanyasi
rebellion of 1770s
• Sung by Rabindranath Tagore in 1896 session for the first time
• Adopted as National Song by INC in 1937 and later also by the Republic of India
in 1950
 Sir Syed Ahmed Khan had founded the Muhammadan Educational
Conference in 1886, but a self-imposed ban prevented it from
discussing politics.
 In December 1906, 3000 Muslim delegates from all over India met at
Dacca for the Muslim Educational Conference and removed the ban
 Taking advantage of this occasion, Nawab Salimullah of Dacca
proposed the setting up of an organisation to look after the interests
of Muslims of India
 The All-India Muslim League was set up on December 30, 1906.
 Headquarters – Lucknow
 Nawab Salimullah of Dacca/Dhaka
 Aga Khan III - FIRST PRESIDENT
 Nawab Mohsin ul Mulk
 Hakim Ajmal Khan
 Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar
 Zafar Ali Khan
 Syed Nabiullah
 Sir Mian Muhammad Shafi
 Like the Indian National Congress, they conducted annual sessions
and put their demands to the British government.
 Initially, they enjoyed the support of the British.
 Their first achievement was the separate electorates for the
Muslims in the Minto-Morley reforms
 Its original political goal was to define and advance the
Indian Muslim's civil rights and to provide protection to
the upper and gentry class of Indian Muslims.
 From 1906–30s, the party worked on its organizational structure, its
credibility in Muslim communities all over the British Indian Empire,
and lacked as a mass organisation
 It mainly represented the landed and commercial Muslim interests of
the United Province
 In the 1930s, the idea of a separate nation-state and influential
philosopher Sir Iqbal's vision of uniting the four provinces in NorthWest British India further supported the rationale of two-nation
theory.
 Trouble was brewing since 1905 session at Benares, when Moderate
dominated INC refused to extend full support to the extremist faction’s
call for protests and boycott of govt. against the partition of Bengal
 1906 session – Dadabhai Naoroji included the demand of Swaraj in
his speech at the behest of extremists. ‘Swaraj resolution’ was passed
and ‘boycott’ was accepted as legitimate form of protest
 The Moderate Congressmen were unhappy as they wanted Swaraj to be
achieved through constitutional methods.
 The Moderate-Extremist dispute over techniques led to a split in INC
finally at the Surat session in 1907
 Session President – Dr.Ras Behari Ghosh ; extremists wanted Lala
Lajpat Rai to become the president
 Extremists came out of the Congress led by Tilak and others.
 They were soon arrested and given long prison terms by the govt.
By 1908, the open phase (as different from the underground revolutionary
phase) of the movement was almost over due to many reasons
 There was severe government repression.
 The movement failed to create an effective organisation or a party structure.
 The movement was rendered leaderless with most of the leaders either
arrested or deported by 1908
 Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal retired from active politics.
 Internal squabbles among leaders, magnified by the Surat split (1907), did
much harm to the movement.
 The movement aroused the people but did not know how to tap the newly
released energy or how to find new forms to give expression to popular
resentment.
 The movement largely remained confined to the upper and middle classes and
zamindars, and failed to reach the rural masses—especially the peasantry.
 Non-cooperation and passive resistance remained mere ideas.
 It was difficult to sustain a mass-based movement at a high pitch for too long.

Buddhism
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Origin
• Buddhism started in India over 2,600 years ago as a way life that
had a potential of transforming a person.
• It is one of the important religions of South and South-Eastern
Asian countries.
• The religion is based upon the teachings, life experiences of its
founder Siddhartha Gautam, born in 563 BCE.
• He was born into royal family of Sakya clan who ruled from
Kapilvastu, in Lumbini which is situated near the Indo-Nepal Border.
(Rummendai pillar by Ashoka is there)
• He was born to Shudhodana and Mahamaya.(she belongs
to kosala dynasty)
• Suddhodhana was the chief of the Sakya clan. Due to this,
Buddha was also known as ‘Sakyamuni’.
• His mother died either giving birth to him or after seven
days. Siddhartha was brought up by his maternal aunt,
Prajapati Gautami. This gave him the name ‘Gautama’.
• He was married to Yashodhara and he had a son Rahula.
• In a series of encounters, known in Buddhist literature
as the four sights, he learned of the suffering of
ordinary people, encountering an old man, a sick man,
a corpse/dead man and, finally, an ascetic holy man,
apparently content and at peace with the world. These
experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life
and take up a spiritual quest.

• At the age of 29, Gautama left home and rejected his life of riches
and embraced a lifestyle of asceticism, or extreme self-discipline.
• He left his palace at 29, with Channa- the charioteer and his
favourite horse, Kanthaka in search of ‘Mahabhinishkramana’
(truth).
• He initially meditated with Alara Kama.
• But he was not convinced that Alara Kama could help him obtain
liberation from sorrow by mental discipline and knowledge.
• Udraka Ramputra was his second teacher.
Origin
• For six years, Siddhartha submitted himself to rigorous ascetic
practices, studying and following different methods of meditation
with various religious teachers. But he was never fully satisfied.
• One day, however, he was offered a bowl of rice from a young girl
(Sujata) and he accepted it.
• In that moment, he realised that physical austerities were not the
means to achieve liberation.
• From then on, he encouraged people to follow a path of balance
rather than extremism. He called this The Middle Way.
• After 49 consecutive days of
meditation,, At the age of 35,
Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree,
in the town of Bodh Gaya (Uruvella)
near Niranjana river (Modern Falgu) in
India, and meditated. He purified his
mind of all defilements and attained
enlightenment after many days, thus
earning the title Buddha, or
“Enlightened One”. Or ‘Nirvana’ .
• Shashanka (Shaiv ruler or Gauda Kingdom) is reputed to have cut
the Bodhi tree where the Buddha found enlightenment, in the
Mahabodhi Temple of Bodh Gaya.
• Thereafter, he attracted a band of followers and instituted a
monastic order. He spent the rest of his life teaching the path of
awakening he had discovered, traveling throughout the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent, and died at the age of 80
(483 BCE) in Kushinagar, India. The event is known
as Mahaparinibban
• Buddha gave his first sermon
in the village of Sarnath, near
the city of Benares in UP.
• This event is known
as Dharma-ChakraPravartana (turning of the
wheel of law).
• And it is delievered to five
ascetics- Kondana, Vappi,
Bhadiya, Mahanama and
Assagi.
• Anada is his favorite disciple.
• Due to Anada, the entry of ladies was permitted in the Sangha.
• Mahaprajapati Gautami (stepmother) was the ist lady to be entered in the
Sangha and she became the ist Bhikkuni.
• Maximum sermon were given by Gautama Buddha in the Kosala Capital
(Shravasti).
• He delievered the sermon for continuing 40 years except in the rainy
season.
• His last sermon was in Vaishali and was to Subhadda.
• The term ‘Buddha’ means ‘enlightened one’.
• Important contemporaries of Buddha were Mahavira Jaina,
Kings Prasenjit, Bimbisara and Ajatasatru.
• Buddha is also known as Tathaghat, Maitreya and Sakyamuni.
Three Ratnas of Buddhism
1. Buddha : highest spiritual potential in every one.
2. Dhamma – The teachings of Budhha
3. Sangha – Community of Buddhist monks and nuns
• Dhamma: Teachings of Buddha are known as Dhamma.
• Buddha did not believe in god or soul.
• Stressed on karma and ahimsa.
• He was against the varna system.
• Buddha taught in Pali.
Principles
• Samsara is “the cycle of birth and death”.
• Buddhists strive to end the sufferings by eradicating
the causes and conditions, applying the methods laid
out by the Buddha and subsequent Buddhists.
Principles
• Karma in Buddhism is the force that drives saṃsāra.
• Good, skillful deeds (kusala) and bad, unskillful
(akusala) actions produce “seeds” in the mind that
come to fruition either in this life or in a subsequent
rebirth.
• The avoidance of unwholesome actions and the
cultivation of positive actions is called śīla.
Principles
• Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go
through a succession of lifetimes as one of many
possible forms of sentient life, each running from
conception to death. Buddhism rejects the concepts
of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul,
as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity.
Tenets of Buddhism
• Buddha asked his followers to avoid the two extremes of
indulgence in worldly pleasure and the practice of strict abstinence
and asceticism.
• He ascribed instead the 'Madhyam Marg' or the middle path which
was to be followed.
• According to him everyone was responsible for their own happiness
in life, stressing upon the individualistic component of Buddhism.
• The main teachings of Buddhism are encapsulated in the basic
concept of four noble truths and eightfold path.
Four noble truths
Suffering (dukkha) is the essence of the world.
Every suffering has a cause – Samudya.
Suffering could be extinguished – Nirodha.
It can be achieved by following the Atthanga
Magga (Eight Fold Path).

Right Effort: Making an effort to improve
Right Mindfulness: Awareness to see things for what they are with clear
consciousness

• Buddha also established code of conduct both for the
monastic order and the laymen to follow which are also
known as the Five Precepts and refrain from them.
 Violence
 stealing
 sexual misconduct
 lying or gossip
 taking intoxicating substances e.g. drugs or drink
• Belief in Nirvana
 When desire and rebirth ends, nirvana is attained.
Freedom from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth is
attained by following the 8-fold path. Buddhism does
not recognise the existence of God and soul.
• Belief in Ahimsa
 The concept of Ahimsa means one should not cause
harm to any living being, animal or man.
• Law of Karma
 According to Law of Karma, Man reaps the fruits of his past
deeds.
• Sangha
 The word Sangha is a combination of Pali and Sanskrit
languages.
 The Sangha is most commonly referred to the monastic
community of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkhunis (nuns).
 Apart from Sangha, the worshippers were called Upasakas.
Practices
• The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are
the Three Jewels:
• Buddha,
• Dharma (the teachings), and
• Sangha (the community).
• Taking “refuge in the triple gem” has traditionally been a
declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist
path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a nonBuddhist.
• The Buddhist place of worship is called a Vihara or Gompa,
which usually houses one or more statues of the Buddha.
• The five great events in Buddha’s life are represented by
symbols as under:
1. Birth by Lotus and Bull
2. Great Renunciation by Horse
3. Nirvana by Bodhi Tree
4. First Sermon by Dharmachakra or Wheel
5. Parinirvana or death by the Stupa.
Major Buddhist Texts
• The Buddha's teaching was oral. He taught for 45 years,
adapting the teaching to suit the group he was addressing.
• The Sangha memorized the teachings, and there were
group recitations at festivals and special occasions.
• The teachings were rehearsed and authenticated at the
First Council and were divided in Three Pitakas in 483 BC.
• His teachings were written down around 25 B.C.E. in Pali.
Three Pitakas
Three Pitakas
• The Vinaya Pitaka consists of rules of conduct and discipline
applicable to the monastic life of the monks and nuns.
• The Sutta Pitaka consists of the main teaching or Dhamma of
Buddha. It is divided into five Nikayas or collections:
 Digha Nikaya
 Majjhima Nikaya
 Samyutta Nikaya
 Anguttara Nikaya ( gives description about 16 mahajanpadas)
 Khuddaka Nikaya
Three Pitakas
• The Abhidamma Pitaka is a philosophical analysis and systematization of
the teaching and the scholarly activity of the monks.
• Other important Buddhist texts include Dipavamsa, Mahavamsa ( provide
information about the then Sri Lanka).
• Milindapanho is Buddist text in which conversation of nagasena (Buddhist
monk) and Greek ruler Menander or Milinda has been noticed.
• Biography of Buddha include Buddhacharita and it was writeen by
Ashwaghosa.
• Jatakas are the fables about the different births of Buddha
• ( Note :Future Buddha is Maitreya).
Buddhist Councils
• Buddhist Councils marked important turning points
in the early Buddhism.
• These councils resulted in sectarian clashes and the
eventual Great Schism that resulted in the two major
schools, Theravada and Mahayana.
• In total, 4 major Buddhist councils were convened.
First Council
• It was held soon after the
Mahaparinirvan of the
Buddha, around 483
BC under the patronage
of King Ajatshatru and
was presided by
Mahakasyapa, a monk.
First Council
• The council was held in the Sattapani cave at Rajgriha.
• The council was held with the purpose of preserving Buddha’s
teachings (Sutta) and rules for disciples. During this council,
the teachings of Buddha were divided into three Pitakas.
 It was held just after the death of the Buddha.
 Suttas and Vinaya were recited by the monks Ananda and Upali
respectively
Second Council
• It was held in Vaishali, a village in
Bihar under the patronage of the
king Kalasoka in 383 BC. It
was presided by Sabakami.
 The Agenda of the Second Buddhist
council was to settle the disagreements
of different subdivisions.
 For this reason, the council is
considered historical.
Third Council
• It was held in 250 BC in
Patliputra under the patronage of
Ashoka and was presided by
Moggaliputta Tissa ((Upagupta).
• The Agenda of the Third Buddhist
council was to analyze the
different schools of Buddhism and
to purify them.
Third Council
• Ashoka sent several groups to
different countries to spread
Buddhism after this council.
• The responses to doctrinal
questions and disputes formulated
at the Third Council were recorded
by Moggaliputta Tissa in
the Kathavatthu, one of the books
of the Abhidhamma Pitaka.
Forth Council
• It was held in 72 AD at Kundalvana,
Kashmir. It was presided by Vasumitra,
while Asvaghosa was his deputy under
the patronage of King Kanishka of Kushan
Empire.
• The Agenda of this Buddhist council was
the reconciliation of various conflicts
between different schools of thought.
• Buddhism was divided into two sects
namely Mahayan and Hinayan.
Schools of Buddhism
Mahayana:
• The followers of Mahayana believe that Buddha
taught universal salvation. One should not aim at
personal nirvana and should help ease the
suffering of humanity.
 The term Mahayana is a Sanskrit word which literally
means "Great Vehicle".
Mahayana
 It believes in the heavenliness of Buddha and Idol worship
of Buddha and Bodhisattvas embodying Buddha Nature.
 In India, this form of Buddhism is followed in Ladakh,
Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh.and then spread east into
Central Asia, East Asia and some areas of Southeast Asia.
 Buddhist schools embedded in China, Korea, Tibet and
Japan belong to the Mahayana tradition.
Hinayana
• Literally Lesser vehicle, also known as Abandoned Vehicle or
Defective vehicle. It believes in the original teaching of Buddha or
Doctrine of elders.
• It does not believe in Idol worship and tries to attain individual
salvation through self discipline and meditation.
• Theravada is a Hinayana sect.
• The word vehicle is used here to describe the Buddha’s teachings,
since the ultimate purpose of the teachings is to carry people from
the shore of this impure world to the other shore of enlightenment
Hinayana
• A great vehicle is like a large ship that can carry many people over
the ocean. A lesser vehicle is like a little boat that can carry only a
few people across a river.
• So Mahayana, which promises spiritual liberation to both monks
and ordinary people is called greater vehicle because it can help a
large number of people in attaining enlightenment.
• On the other hand, Hinayana which calls for strict discipline cannot
be practiced by ordinary people can only carry fewer people
towards enlightenment.
Theravada
• It is the most ancient branch of extant Buddhism today.
• It remains closest to the original teachings of the Buddha.
• The Theravada Buddhism is better known as the earliest form
of Buddhism. The ‘Thera’ means old and ‘Vada’ means school.
• The aim of this form of Buddhism is to attain personal nirvana
through the triple recourse to ethical conduct, mental
discipline and higher knowledge or wisdom.
Theravada
• It has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia
(Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar etc.).
• In India, this strain of Buddhism is represented by the
followers of Dr B.R.Ambedkar known as the Ambedkar
Buddhists, who are exclusive to India.
• Theravada is also called “southern Buddhism” as it was the
form that developed in souther part of the Indian
subcontinent, primarliy Sri Lanka.
Vajrayana
• Vajrayana means “The Vehicle of the Thunderbolt”, also
known as tantric Buddhism.
• This Buddhist school developed in India around 900 CE.
• It is very complex set of rituals compared with the rest of the
Buddhist schools.
• Vajrayana practiced mainly in Tibet and Mongolia, and
adjacent parts of China and Russia
Zen
• It is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated
in China during the Tang dynasty as the Chan school
of Chinese Buddhism in and later developed into
various schools.
• It spread to Japan in 7
th century C.E.
• Meditation is the most distinctive feature of this
Buddhist tradition.
Bodhisattva
• A bodhisattva is an ordinary person who takes up a course in his or
her life that moves in the direction of buddha.
• You’re a bodhisattva, I’m a bodhisattva; actually, anyone who
directs their attention, their life, to practicing the way of life of a
buddha is a bodhisattva.
Spread of Buddhism
• Pali language has a prominent role in the spread of Buddhism.
• Emperor Ashoka and Kaniska had a keen interest in spreading
Buddhism.
• Buddha also organised the Sangha as a religious order, whose
doors were open to everybody, irrespective of caste and sex.
• They promoted education through residential universities like
Valabhi, Nalanda and Vikramshila.
Spread of Buddhism
• After the death of Buddha, the monks assembled four times and
the effect of these events had a great impact of spreading of
Buddhism.
• Buddha had two kinds of disciples – monks (bhikshus) and lay
worshippers (upasikas).
• The monks were organized into the Sangha for the purpose of
spreading his teachings.
• The Sangha was governed on democratic lines and was
empowered to enforce discipline among its members.
Spread of Buddhism
• Owing to the organised efforts made by the Sangha,
Buddhism made rapid progress in North India even during
Buddha’s life time.
• After the death of Buddha, his followers traversed on his path
of meditation and roamed throughout the countryside.
• For 200 years Buddhism remained overshadowed by their
Hindu counterparts until the advent of Great Mauryan King –
Ashoka.
Spread of Buddhism
• After the bloodbath in his Kalinga conquest, emperor Ashoka
decided to give up the policy of worldly conquest and
adopted Dhamma conquest.
• Ashoka during the third Buddhist council dispatched various
Buddhist missions to different areas such as Gandhara, Kashmir,
Greece, Sri Lanka, Burma (Myanmar), Egypt, and Thailand.
• Through his missionary effort Ashoka spread Buddhism into West
Asia and Ceylon. Thus a local religious sect was transformed into a
world religion.
Contribution of Buddhism to Indian Culture
• Buddhism has made remarkable contribution to the
development of Indian culture:
 The concept of ahimsa was its chief contribution. Later, it
became one of the cherished values of our nation.
 Its contribution to the art and architecture of India was
notable. The stupas at Sanchi, Bharhut and Gaya are
wonderful pieces of architecture.
Contribution of Buddhism to Indian Culture
 It promoted education through residential
universities like those at Taxila, Nalanda and
Vikramasila.
 The language of Pali and other local languages
developed through the teachings of Buddhism.
 It had also promoted the spread of Indian culture
to other parts of Asia.
Heritage Sites

 Archaeological Site of Nalanda Mahavihara at
Nalanda, Bihar
 Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi, MP
 Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya, Bihar
 Ajanta Caves Aurangabad, Maharashtra
Cause of Decline
• Revival of Brahmanism & rise of Bhagavatism
• Use of Sanskrit instead of Pali from 4
th Buddhist council (Around 100 AD)
• After birth of Mahayana, Practice of Idol worship, Huge offerings &
donations became common & led to the deterioration of moral standards

Cabinet Mission (Summer of 1946)
On 15 March, 1946 Clement Atlee (PM of England) made a historic announcement
in which the right to self-determination and the framing of a Constitution for India
were conceded.
Consequently, 3 members of the British Cabinet were sent to India, known as the
Cabinet Mission–
Pethick Lawrence – S.o.S. for India
Sir Stafford Cripps - president of the board of trade
A V Alexander – First lord of Admiralty (political head of the Royal Navy)
 The mission arrived on March 24, 1946 to devise a machinery to draw up the
constitution of Independent India and make arrangements for interim
Government.
 The mission spent some 3 weeks to discuss with the leaders of various political
parties, but could not arrive at any agreed solution.
 So finally it announced its own recommendations on May 16, 1946.
Main features of Cabinet Mission were -
• Proposed setting up an Interim Government.
• Proposed the formation of a Union of India.
• Union would remain in charge of only foreign affairs, defence and
communications
• The residuary powers to be vested in the provinces.(weak centre and
strong province government)
• Provisions for three groups of provinces to possess their separate
constitutions.
• Rejection of the demand for a full-fledged Pakistan
• Both the Muslim League and the Congress accepted the plan (initially)***.
 Congress accepted the idea of constituent assembly but rejected the scheme of the
government having weak centre and strong provinces. Also rejected division in 3
typed of provinces
 Consequently, elections were held in July 1946 for the formation of a Constituent
Assembly.
 Congress secured 205 out of 214 General seats.
 The Muslim League got 73 out of 78 Muslim seats.
S.No Name of the Party Seats won
1. Congress 208
2. Muslim League 73
3. Unionist Party 1
4. Unionist Muslims 1
5. Unionist Scheduled Castes 1
6. Krishak – Praja Party 1
7. Scheduled Castes Federation 1
8. Sikhs (Non-Congress) 1
9. Communist Party 1
10. Independents 8
Total 296
Results of the elections to the Constituent Assembly (July-Aug 1946)
 The Muslim league first approved the Cabinet mission plan.
 But when Congress declared that it could change the scheme(of weak centre)
through its majority in the Constituent Assembly, they rejected the plan.
 On July 27, the Muslim League Council met at Bombay where Jinnah reiterated
the demand for Pakistan as the only course left open to the Muslim
League. Jinnah called the Muslims to resort to “Direct Action” to achieve the
land of their dream “Pakistan”.
 Direct Action Day by Muslim League to show the strength of Muslim feelings
both to British and Congress.
 In Calcutta, the communal tension was whipped up by both Hindu and Muslim
newspapers.
 The Muslims announced a strike on that day while Hindus asked them
shopkeepers to keep shops open.
 The result was Great Calcutta Killing in which 6000 Hindus and Muslims
butchered each other and 20,000 others were maimed, raped or violated.
 Riots soon spread to all parts of North India and it turned into a Civil War
between Hindus and Muslims.
 Amidst this situation of Chaos and insanity, Mahatma Gandhi went to calm
down the situation.

Chalukyas
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Introduction
• The Chalukyas ruled parts of Southern and Central
India between the 6
th century and the 12th century.
The most important source of history of the Badami
Chalukyas Dynasty is the Aihole inscription of
Pulakesin II written by his court poet Ravikirti in
Sanskrit language and Kannada script.
Introduction
• The Chalukyas seem to be a race of Rajputs from
North who imposed their rule upon the Dravidian
inhabitants of the Deccan tableland. The Royal
Emblem of Chalukyas of Badami was “Varaha”. The
earliest reference in this dynasty is of one Jayasimha,
who has also been referred to as Vallabha. The first
independent king of this dynasty was Pulkesin I.
The Three Chalukyas

dynasties.

Jaina (Parshwavanath). The largest and most impressive of
these is Cave 3, dedicated to Vishnu.
• The architecture is a mixture of the Nagara style and
Dravida style. Apart from the above four, there is a fifth
natural Buddhist cave in Badami.
Virupaksha Temple, Hampi
• Virupaksha Temple is located in Hampi in Karnataka on the
banks of the Tungabhadra river. Virupaksha Temple is dedicated
to Lord Shiva and was created by the Chalukyas of Badami
initially in 8th century. The temple was improvised in Vijaynagar
Empire. It is in the Virupaksha temple at Hampi that full glory of
the Early Chalukyan art can be seen. This temple was built in 735
AD by a queen of Vikramaditya II to celebrate the victory over
the Pallavas of Kanchipuram.
Ladkhan Temple, Aihole
• The Ladkhan temple is the earliest temple of Aihole,
which dates back to 5
th century AD. An inscription on
this temple says that it was dedicated to Durga. There
is a Shiva ling out there. The temple is known as Lad
Khan after its owner (in most recent times) at a place
used as cattle sheds or houses. This temple has a large
porch and is made in a Panchayat hall kind of design
with 12 pillars.
Navbhramha Group of Temples, Alampur
• The Navabrahma Group of temples is located at
Alampur in Andhra Pradesh. There are total 9 temples
and present a marvelous piece of art of the Chalukyas
of Badami outside Karnataka. These temple are based
upon the Nagara style and do not reflect the Dravidian
style of temple architecture (8 out of 9 are clearly
Nagara style). The Alampur temples are the finest
example of the Chalukyas of Badami Art.
Navbhramha Group of Temples, Alampur
• The Nava Bhramma temples are Taraka Bhramma,
Swarga Bhramma, Padma Bhramma, Bala Bhramma,
Garuda Bhramma, Kumara Bhramma, Arka
Bhramma, Vira Bhramma and the Vishwa Bhramma.
These temples are all enclosed in a courtyard on the
left bank of the river Tungabhadra.
Temples at Pattadakal
• Numerous temples at Pattadakal on the bank of river
Malprabha, some kilometers from Aihole mark the
return of the Chalukya patronage to Karnataka after
several years of activity in the Andhra Pradesh. The
first temple is Galagnatha Temple which is in Nagara
style similar to the Alampur temple.
• The noticeable aspect is that though ornamentation
of Chalukya temples bears elements of Nagara and
Dravidian tradition but they have combined the
elements in so prudent way that they become
unique and distinctive feature of their own.

Vesara style
• The Vesara style also called the Chalukyan
type possessed the Dravidian vimana and the
Nagara- type faceted walls.
Influence of Nagara tradition
• The plan of shrine, subsidiary shrine, panchayatan style
bears similarity to Nagara school.
• The plan of vestibule joining the sanctum to mantapa
bears resemblance to orissan temples.
• The most of the temple pillars in Karnataka region
bears similarity to sekhari and bhumija type of pillars in
northern india.
Influence of Nagara tradition
• The stepped diamond plan that is a plan of design
arrangement as seen in Chalukya temples is from northern
region.
• The most of the temples in kalyani portrays Nagara
articulation projecting stepped diamond or stellate plan.
Influence of Dravida tradition
• The Dravida influence is mainly visible in
vimana of the Chalukya temples in first part of
the Chalukya rule.
Combination of Nagara and Dravida style
• Vesara sikhar or kadamba sikhara: It is a shikhara of
Chalukya temple showing northern shikhara shikhara and
southern vimana features.
• Ornamentation: Miniature decorative towers and
ornamentation of walls in Chalukya temples show
combination of both Nagara and Dravida style.
Special departure from Nagara and
Dravida tradition
• In case of entrance hall to shrine Chalukya temple
bears special uniqueness. It has two or more than two
entrances while
• There is a small closed mantapa to the shrine in Nagara
temples.
• There is an enlarged, open and closed mantapa in
Dravida temples.
Own distinctive features
• Ornamentation : In case of ornamentation of temple walls and
pillars, Chalukya temple shows indigenous quality.
• Transformation of Dravida tower : The Chalukya builders modified
the Dravida towers by minimizing the height of each storey and
arranging them in descending order of height from base to top with
much ornamentation in each storey.
• Transformation of Nagara tower : Instead of inclined storey here
modification is seen in the vertical shape of the tower.
Two special features of Chalukya temples
• Mantapa: The mantapa has two types of roof – domical
ceilings (the dome like ceilings standing on four pillars are
very attractive) or Square ceilings (these are vigorously
ornamented with mythological pictures).
• Pillars: As mentioned earlier, the miniature decorative
pillars of Chalukya temples stands with its own artistic
value.
Characteristics of temple architecture
• The pillars of Chalukya temple are monolithic shaft whose
height determines the height of mantapa and temples.
• Chalukya architects did not use mortar. It allows ventilation
of light to the innermost part of the temples.
• The vestibules were ornamented with artificial lights which
eliminated darkness as well as added some kind of mystic
feelings.

by Hoysala artist. Chalukya architecture is also called the precursor
of Hoysala art.

CITIZENSHIP

Citizenship
Introduction:
• India has two kinds of people—citizens and aliens.
• Citizens - are full members of the Indian State and owe allegiance to it. They enjoy all civil and
political rights.
• Aliens, on the other hand, are the citizens of some other state and hence, do not enjoy all the
civil and political rights.
• They are of two categories—friendly aliens or enemy aliens.
• Friendly aliens are the subjects of those countries that have cordial relations with India.
• Enemy aliens, on the other hand, are the subjects of that country that is at war with India.
They enjoy lesser rights than the friendly aliens, eg, they do not enjoy protection against
arrest and detention (Article 22).
1. Right against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place
of birth (Article 15).
2. Right to equality of opportunity in the matter of public employment (Article
16).
3. Right to freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association,
movement, residence and profession (Article 19).
4. Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29 and 30).
5. Right to vote in elections to the Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly.
6. Right to contest for the membership of the Parliament and the state
legislature.
7. Eligibility to hold certain public offices, that is, President of India, VicePresident of India, judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts,
governor of states, attorney general of India and advocate general of states.
Rights and Privileges given only to the Citizens of India:
*Note:
In India both a citizen by birth as well as a naturalised citizen are eligible for
the office of President while in USA, only a citizen by birth and not a
naturalised citizen is eligible for the office of President.
Constitutional Provisions:
• The Constitution deals with the citizenship from Articles 5 to 11 under
Part II.
• It only identifies the persons who became citizens of India at its
commencement (i.e., on January 26, 1950). It does not deal with the
problem of acquisition or loss of citizenship subsequent to its
commencement. It empowers the Parliament to enact a law to provide
for such matters and any other matter relating to citizenship.
Accordingly, following laws were brought about
Citizenship Act, 1955
• The Citizenship Act (1955) provides for acquisition and loss of
citizenship after the commencement of the Constitution. This Act has
been amended many times by the following Acts:
1. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1986.
2. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1992.
3. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003.
4. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005.
5. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2015
Originally, the Citizenship Act (1955) also provided for the
Commonwealth Citizenship. But, this provision was repealed by the
Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003.
According to the Constitution, the following four categories of persons became
the citizens of India at its commencement i.e., on 26 January, 1950:
Article 5 - A person who had his domicile in India and also fulfilled any one of the
three conditions –
1. if he was born in India;
2. if either of his parents was born in India;
3. if he has been ordinarily resident in India for five years immediately before
the commencement of the Constitution, became a citizen of India .
• Article 6 - A person who migrated to India from Pakistan became an Indian
citizen if he or either of his parents or any of his grandparents was born in
undivided India and also fulfilled any one of the two conditions -
 in case he migrated to India before July 19, 1948, he had been
ordinarily resident in India since the date of his migration;
 or in case he migrated to India on or after July 19, 1948, he had been
registered as a citizen of India. But, a person could be so registered only if
he had been resident in India for six months preceding the date of his
application for registration
Article 7 - A person who migrated to Pakistan from India after March 1,
1947, but later returned to India for resettlement could become an Indian
citizen. For this, he had to be resident in India for six months preceding the
date of his application for registration.
Article 8 - A person who, or any of whose parents or grandparents, was born
in undivided India but who is ordinarily residing outside India shall become
an Indian citizen if he has been registered as a citizen of India by the
diplomatic or consular representative of India in the country of his residence,
whether before or after the commencement of the Constitution. Thus, this
provision covers the overseas Indians who may want to acquire Indian
citizenship.
The other constitutional provisions with respect to the citizenship are as
follows:
Article 9 - No person shall be a citizen of India or be deemed to be a
citizen of India, if he has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any
foreign state.
Article 10 - Every person who is or is deemed to be a citizen of India shall
continue to be such citizen, subject to the provisions of any law made by
Parliament.
Article 11 - Parliament shall have the power to make any provision with
respect to the acquisition and termination of citizenship and all other
matters relating to citizenship.

A person shall be deemed to be of Indian origin if he, or either of his parents, was
born in undivided India or in such other territory which became part of India
after the 15 th August, 1947. All the above categories of persons must take an
oath of allegiance before they are registered as citizens of India.

Every naturalised citizen must take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of India.
5. By Incorporation of Territory
If any foreign territory becomes a part of India, the Government of India
specifies the persons who among the people of the territory shall be the
citizens of India.
Such persons become the citizens of India from the notified date.
For example, when Pondicherry became a part of India, the Government of
India issued the Citizenship (Pondicherry) Order, 1962, under the Citizenship
Act, 1955.
Loss of Citizenship: (According to the Citizenship Act of 1955)
1. Renunciation
 By making a declaration renouncing his Indian citizenship.
Upon the registration of that declaration, that person ceases to be a
citizen of India.
Further, when a person renounces his Indian citizenship, every minor
child of that person also loses Indian citizenship.
However, when such a child attains the age of eighteen, he may resume
Indian citizenship. (by descent clause)
2. Termination
 When an Indian citizen voluntarily (consciously, knowingly and
without duress, undue influence or compulsion) acquires the
citizenship of another country, his Indian citizenship automatically
terminates.
This provision, however, does not apply during a war in which India is
engaged.
3. Deprivation
It is a compulsory termination of Indian citizenship by the Central government, if
 (a) the citizen has obtained the citizenship by fraud:
 (b) the citizen has shown disloyalty to the Constitution of India

 (d) the citizen has, within 5 years after registration or naturalisation, been
imprisoned in any country for two years

Single Citizenship
• The Indian Constitution is federal and envisages a dual polity (Centre and
states), it provides for only a single citizenship, that is, the Indian citizenship.
• The citizens in India owe allegiance only to the Union. There is no separate
state citizenship. The other federal states like USA and Switzerland, on the
other hand, adopted the system of double citizenship.
• In USA, each person is not only a citizen of USA but also of the particular state
to which he belongs. Thus, he owes allegiance to both and enjoys dual sets of
rights—one set conferred by the national government and another by the
state government.

Company Rule in Bengal
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Company Rule in Bengal
• During the short period of eight years
(1757 to 1765) three nawabs, Siraj-udDaula, Mir Jafar and Mir Qasim ruled
over Bengal but they failed to uphold
the sovereignty of the nawab and
ultimately the reign of control passed
into the hands of the British.
• Bengal was the most fertile and the
richest province of India and its
industries and commerce were well
developed.
Company Rule in Bengal
• In the beginning, the East India Company and its servants had highly profitable trading
interests in the province.
• The Company secured valuable privileges in 1717 under a royal farman by the Mughal
Emperor Farrukhsiyar, which had granted the Company the freedom to export and
import their goods in Bengal without paying taxes and the right to issue passes or
dastaks for the movement of such goods.
• The Company’s servants were also permitted to trade but were not covered by this
farman. They were required to pay the same taxes as Indian merchants.
• This farman was a perpetual source of conflict between the Company and the Nawabs of
Bengal. First it meant loss of revenue to the Bengal Government. Secondly, the power to
issue dastaks for the Company’s goods was misused by its servants to evade taxes on
their private trade.
Company Rule in Bengal
• All the Nawabs of Bengal, start from Murshid Quli Khan, Shuja-ud-daulah to Alivardi
Khan, had objected to the English interpretation of the farman of 1717.
• They compelled the Company to pay lump sums to their treasury, and firmly suppressed
the misuse of dastaks.
• The Company had been compelled to accept the authority of the Nawabs in the matter,
but its servants had taken every opportunity to evade and defy this authority.
• By the time Siraj-ud-Daula succeeded Alivardi Khan as nawab of Bengal in 1756 trade
privileges and their misuse by the Company and its officers had already become an issue
of conflict.
• The Company officials also suspected that nawab was going to have an alliance with the
French in Bengal.
Company Rule in Bengal
• The breaking point came when, without taking the Nawab’s permission, the
Company began to fortify Calcutta in expectation of the coming struggle with the
French, who were stationed at this time at Chandernagore/WB.
• Siraj-ud-Daula’s prevented the English from fortifying Fort William.
• However the English refused to stop the new fortification which prompted the
Nawab to attack their factory at Qasim Bazar.
• The Nawab captured Fort William, taking 146 Englishmen prisoners. Holed up in a
very small room 123 died on 20th June, 1756 out of suffocation and only 23
survived. English historians describe this incident as the Black Hole Tragedy.
• This incident instigated the English at Chennai to send a relieving force under
Robert Clive alongwith Admiral Watson to Bengal.

Company Rule in Bengal
• The British retaliation started with hatching a conspiracy against the nawab in
alliance with his
• Mir Bakshi : Mir Jafar,
• Manik Chand : the Officer-in-Charge of Calcutta,
• Amichand : a rich merchant,
• Jagat Seth : the biggest banker of Bengal,
• and Khadim Khan who commanded a large number of the Nawab’s troops and
Rai Durlabh.
• Clive marched towards Plassey on 23rd June, 1757; which was near the
Nawab’s capital of Murshidabad.

Company Rule in Bengal
• As agreed earlier, Mir Jafar, the Commander-in-chief of Siraj-ud-daula did
not take up arms against the English army and on the other hand the
Nawab’s soldiers fled from the battlefield.
• Later the Nawab was killed by, Mir Jafar’s son Miran.
• Mir Madan and Mohan Lal, who were loyal to the Nawab fought bravely but
were killed due to treachery of Mir Jafar and Rai Durlabh.
Company Rule in Bengal
• English victory in the battle of Plassey (23 June, 1757) was pre-decided.
• It was not the superiority of the military power but the conspiracy that
helped the English in winning the battle.
• Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the Nawab was awarded the
Nawabship by Clive for his support to the English.
• Mir Jafar responded to this favour by paying a sum of Rs. One Crore and
Seventy Seven lakhs to the Company and large sums to the Company
officers as bribe.
Company Rule in Bengal
• But Mir Jafar could not support the ever increasing demands of the English who
were also suspicious about his collaboration with the Dutch Trading Company.
• Mir Jafar was deposed in 1760 and Mir Qasim was placed on the throne by the
British.
• This alliance was of great help to the British in their campaign against the French in
1760-1761; the money paid by Mir Qasim helped the Calcutta Council to finance
their war in South.
• The Nawab succeeded in establishing a better system of administration. But he
came into conflict with the British in Bengal on the question of a privilege, i.e., duty
free private trade of the Company.
• Mir Qasim’s proposed plan about equal trade duties for British and Indian traders
was turned down by the British Council at Calcutta.
Company Rule in Bengal
• Mir Qasim, in the circumstances, remitted all duties on Indians and the
British alike for two years.
• This measure deprived the British private traders of the privileged position
they had created for themselves, they could not compete with Indian
traders on equal terms.
• The Nawab’s attempts to reorganize the army and shifting of capital from
Murshidabad/Benagal to Monghyr/Bihar were also taken as unforgivable
offences by the Company.
Company Rule in Bengal
• The war broke out between Mir Kasim and the Company in 1763.
• Mir Qasim escaped to Oudh to organise a confederacy with Shuja-uddaula, the Nawab of Oudh and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II in a final
bid to oust the English from Bengal.
• The combined armies of the three powers fought the Battle of Buxar with
English army commanded by Major Hector Munro on October 22, 1764.

Company Rule in Bengal
• Battle of Plassey had made the English a powerful factor in the politics of Bengal, the
victory of Buxar made them a great power of North India and contenders for the
supremacy of the whole country.
• The English now faced the Afghans and the Marathas as serious rival in the final
struggle for the empire of Hindustan.
• Treaty of Allahabad followed Aug 1765 in which the English got the Diwani ( or the right
to collect revenue) of Bengal and thus became the master of whole of Bengal ( Bengal,
Bihar and Orissa)
• The dual Government of Bengal system followed wherein the company acquired the
real power, while the responsibility of administration rested on nawab of Bengal.
• The Mughal Emperor was made virtually Company’s prisoner at Allahabad.

CONSTITUTIONAL
BODIES – PART 2
(national commission on sc and st,
special officer for linguistic
minorities)
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

• A constitutional body in the sense that it is directly established by Article
338 of the Constitution.
• On the other hand, the other national commissions like
the National Commission for Women (1992),
the National Commission for Minorities (1993),
the National Commission for Backward Classes (1993),
the National Human Rights Commission (1993) and
the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (2007)
are statutory bodies in the sense that they are established by acts of the
Parliament
National Commission for SCs’
Evolution of the Commission
• Originally, Article 338 of the Constitution provided for the appointment of a
Special Officer for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) to
investigate all matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for the SCs and
STs and to report to the President on their working.
• In 1978, the Government (through a Resolution) set up a non-statutory multimember Commission for SCs and STs; the Office of Commissioner for SCs and
STs also continued to exist.
• In 1987, the Government (through another Resolution) modified the functions
of the Commission and renamed it as the National Commission for SCs and
STs.
• Later, the 65th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1990 provided for the
establishment of a high level multi-member National Commission for SCs and
STs in the place of a single Special Officer for SCs and STs.
• This constitutional body replaced the Commissioner for SCs and STs as well as
the Commission set up under the Resolution of 1987.
• Again, the 89th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2003 bifurcated the
combined National Commission for SCs and STs into two separate bodies,
namely,
• National Commission for Scheduled Castes (under Article 338) and National
Commission for Scheduled Tribes (under Article 338- A).
• The separate National Commission for SCs came into existence in 2004.
• It consists of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and three other members.
• They are appointed by the President by warrant
Report of the Commission
• The commission presents an annual report to the president.
• The President places all such reports before the Parliament, along with a
memorandum explaining the action taken on the recommendations made by
the Commission.
• The President also forwards any report of the Commission pertaining to a state
government to the state governor.
• The governor places it before the state legislature, along with a memorandum
explaining the action taken on the recommendations of the Commission.
• Like the National Commission for Schedules Castes (SCs), the National
Commission for Scheduled Tribes (STs) is also a constitutional body in the
sense that it is directly established by Article 338-A of the Constitution.
Separate Commission for STs
• The National Commission for SCs and STs came into being consequent
upon passing of the 65th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1990.
• The Commission was established under Article 338 of the Constitution
with the objective of monitoring all the safeguards provided for the SCs
and STs under the Constitution or other laws.
National Commission For STs’
• Geographically and culturally, the STs are different from the SCs and their
problems are also different from those of SCs.
• In 1999, a new Ministry of Tribal Affairs was created to provide a sharp
focus to the welfare and development of the STs.
• Hence, in order to safeguard the interests of the STs more effectively, it
was proposed to set up a separate National Commission for STs by
bifurcating the existing combined National Commission for SCs and STs.
This was done by passing the 89th Constitutional Amendment Act of
2003.
• This Act further amended Article 338 and inserted a new Article 338-A in
the Constitution.
• The separate National Commission for STs came into existence in 2004.
• It consists of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and three other members.
• They are appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal.
Functions of the Commission
• The functions of the Commission are:
(a) To investigate and monitor all matters relating to the constitutional and
other legal safeguards for the STs and to evaluate their working;
(b) To inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of
rights and safeguards of the STs;
(c) To participate and advise on the planning process of socio-economic
development of the STs and to evaluate the progress of their development
under the Union or a state;
(d) To make recommendations as to the measures that should be taken by
the Union or a state for the effective implementation of those safeguards
and other measures for the protection, welfare and socio-economic
development of the STs; and
Constitutional Provisions
• Originally, the Constitution of India did not make any provision with
respect to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities.
• Later, the States Re - organisation Commission (1953-55) made a
recommendation in this regard.
• Accordingly, the Seventh Constitutional Amendment Act of 1956 inserted
a new
 Article 350-B
 in Part XVII of the Constitution.
Special Officer For Linguistic Minorities
• This article contains the following provisions:
1. There should be a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities. He is to be
appointed by the President of India.
2. To investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided for
linguistic minorities under the Constitution
3. He would report to the President upon those matters at such intervals
as the President may direct. The President should place all such reports
before each House of Parliament and send to the governments of the
states concerned.
• It must be noted here that the Constitution does not specify the
qualifications, tenure, salaries and allowances, service conditions and
procedure for removal of the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities.
Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities
• In pursuance of the provision of Article 350-B of the Constitution, the office of the
Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities was created in 1957.
• He is designated as the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities.
• The Commissioner has his headquarters at Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh).
• He has three regional offices at Belgaum (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and
Kolkata (West Bengal).
• Each is headed by an Assistant Commissioner.
• The Commissioner is assisted at headquarters by Deputy Commissioner and an
Assistant Commissioner.
• He maintains liaison with the State Governments and Union Territories through
nodal officers appointed by them.
• At the Central level, the Commissioner falls under the Ministry of Minority Affairs.
Hence, he submits the annual reports or other reports to the President through the
Union Minority Affairs Minister.
Functions
• To investigate all matters related to safeguards provided to the linguistic
minorities
• To submit to the President of India, the reports on the status of
implementation of the Constitutional and the nationally agreed safeguards for
the linguistic minorities
• To monitor the implementation of safeguards through questionnaires, visits,
conferences, seminars, meetings, review mechanism, etc
Objectives
1. To provide equal opportunities to the linguistic minorities for inclusive
development and national integration
2. To spread awareness amongst the linguistic minorities about the safeguards
available to them
3. To ensure effective implementation of the safeguards provided for the
linguistic minorities in the Constitution and other safeguards, which are
agreed to by the states / U.T.s
4. To handle the representations for redress of grievances related to the
safeguards for linguistic minorities

C. Rajagopalachari Formula
Background -
•Gandhiji and INC were held responsible for the violence during QIM
•Gandhiji said British govt is responsible and asked for judicial inquiry
•He protested and even went on fast in jail
•Ultimately released from Jail in May 1944 after worsening health
•But now deadlock happened between ML and INC regarding division and
independence
Rajagopalachari, the veteran Congress leader, prepared a formula for
Congress- Muslim League cooperation, acceptable to Gandhi.
The Formula -
 Muslim League to endorse Congress demand for independence.
 League to cooperate with Congress in forming a provisional government at centre.
 After the war, the entire population of Muslim majority areas in the North-West &
North-East India to decide by a plebiscite, whether or not to form a separate
sovereign state.
 In case of acceptance of partition, agreement to be made jointly for safeguarding
defence, commerce, communications, etc.
 The above terms to be operative only if England transferred full powers to India.
 It was a tacit acceptance of the League’s demand for Pakistan.
 Hindu leaders led by Vir Savarkar (of Hindu Mahasabha) condemned the CR Plan.
 CR formula was used as a basis of Gandhi-Jinnah talks.
 Gandhi and Jinnah met in September 1944.
 In these talks, Gandhi proposed that only the Muslims living in Baluchistan, Sindh,
N.W.F.P and parts of the Punjab, Bengal and Assam, who desired to lives in separation
from the rest of India, should form the new state.
 But on this, Jinnah insisted that Pakistan should include all the six provinces
resolution of the Muslim league in 1940
Jinnah’s Objections
 He wanted only the Muslims of North-West and
 North-East to vote in the plebiscite and not the entire population.
 He also opposed the idea of a common centre.

Cripps Mission
 In March 1942, a mission headed by Sir Stafford Cripps(cabinet minister) was sent
to India to seek Indian support for the war.
Main Proposals
 An Indian Union with a dominion status would be set up
 It would be free to decide its relations with the Commonwealth and free to
participate in the United Nations and other international bodies.
 After the end of the war, a constituent assembly would be convened to frame a new
constitution.
 Members would be partly elected by the provincial assemblies through proportional
representation and partly nominated by the princes.
 The British Government would accept the new constitution subject to two conditions
–
 Any province not willing to join the Union could have a separate constitution and
form a separate Union
 The new constitution making body and the British Government would negotiate a
treaty to effect the transfer of power and to safeguard racial and religious minorities.
 In the meantime, defence of India would remain in British hands and the governorgeneral’s powers would remain intact.
Objections of INC leaders to the proposal
 The offer of dominion status.
 Representation of the states by nominees and not by elected representatives.
 Right to provinces to secede.
 Absence of any plan for immediate transfer of power.
 Absence of any real share in defence.
 The governor general’s supremacy had been retained.
Gandhi called Cripps proposals as a “Post-dated Cheque of a failing bank”
The Muslim League objection:
 Criticized the idea of a single Indian Union
 Did not like the machinery for the creation of a constituent assembly
 Thought that the proposals denied to the Muslims the right to self-determination and
the creation of Pakistan

Current Electricity
By Dr Vipan Goyal
• Electric Current: An electric current whose magnitude and direction do
not change with time is called direct current, and whose magnitude
changes continuously and direction changes periodically is called
alternating current.
• Inverter is a device which converts DC to AC.
• In solid conductors, electric current flows due to flow of electrons, in
liquids due to flow of ions as well as electrons and in semiconductors due
to flow of electrons and holes.
• Its S.I. unit is Ampere
Electric Currents in Conductors
• In other materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to
move within the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,
develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.
• In solid conductors:
 (a) When no electric field is present- The number of electrons travelling in
any direction will be equal to the number of electrons travelling in the
opposite direction. So, there will be no net electric current.
 (b) If an electric field is applied- An electric field will be created and is
directed from the positive towards the negative charge.
 They will thus move to neutralize the charges. The electrons, as long as they
are moving, will constitute an electric current.
The Cell
• The cell stores chemical energy and transfers it to electrical energy when a
circuit is connected.
• When two or more cells are connected together. we called this a Battery.
• The cells chemical energy is used up pushing a current round a circuit.
• Electric cell are of two types
 Primary cell cannot be charged. Voltaic, Daniell and Leclanche cells are
primary cells.
 Secondary cell can be charged again and again. Acid and alkali
accumulators are secondary cells. Working of electric cells is based on
chemical effect of electric current.
Electric Cell
• Cells are of two types viz. primary and secondary.
Examples of primary cells include torches, radios,
etc.
• The constituents of a dry cell are a negative
electrode, a positive electrode and an electrolyte.
• The negative electrode is made with zinc as it is the
outer shell of the cell.
• A carbon rod surrounded by a mixture of carbon
and manganese dioxide acts as the positive
electrode.
• The electrolyte is a mixture of ammonium chloride
and zinc chloride in the form of a paste.
• A dry cell produces about 1.5 volt.
Electric Cell
• Lead cells which are used for ignition and
lighting on motor car are secondary cells.
• Secondary cells are used as storage cells
or accumulators. Due to their low
internal resistance, secondary cells are
capable of giving large currents.
• They can be recharged after they
discharged. They are used in emergency
lights in hospitals and other buildings.
Electric Cell
• Count Alessandro Volta made the first battery.
• The first practical primary cell (non-rechargeable) was produced by John
Frederic Daniell using zinc and copper electrodes.
• This was followed by the first secondary (rechargeable) cell invented by
Gaston Plante .
• This cell, based upon the use of lead and sulfuric acid, is still employed as
the car battery.
• The Leclanche ‘Dry’ Cell was developed into the modern ordinary torch
battery. It has a zinc case and a carbon electrode down its centre.
Electric Cell
• Michael Faraday confirmed his hypothesis that magnetism could produce
electricity when he found that a magnet moving in a coil of wire induced a
current in the wire when the wire was present in an electric circuit.
• These discoveries soon led to the electric motor and to the dynamo, a
device for generating electricity by spinning a coil of wire between the
poles of a suitably shaped magnet.
• James Clerk Maxwell predicted that by using oscillating electric currents it
should be possible to generate electromagnetic waves which travel at the
speed of light.
• Heinrich Hertz produced such waves, which were soon used for wireless
transmissions.
Car Battery
• In a car battery, there is a combination of 6 lead-acid
secondary cells each with 2.04 volts.
• These cells use lead plates as electrodes and sulphuric
acid as the electrolyte.
• The car battery provides large currents for a short time as
large currents are required to start the engine.
• After engine started, the alternator provides power to the
car.
• Emf of a Cell
• The work done by the cell to bring a (+)ve charge from its
own terminal to the other is known as its emf
(electromotive force). Electromotive force is work but not
a force.
Joule’s Law of Heating
• Current can produce three effects: heating effect, magnetic effect and chemical
effect.
• Electric bulb, electric kettle, heater etc., devices work on the basis of heating effect
of electric current.
• To protect the domestic appliances from sudden change in electricity, fuses are
used. It is made of tin, lead, alloy (63% + 37%).
• It should have high resistance and low melting point always connected in series.
Electric power
• The electrical energy produced or consumed per unit time is called
electric power.
• Electric power, P = VI = 𝐼2𝑅 =𝑉2/ 𝑅 ( V= IR )
• 1 kWh = 3.6 × 106 J
Chemical Effect of Electric Current
• When an electric current is passed through an acidic or basic solution, it
decomposes into its positive and negative ions. The positive ions collect at
negative electrode (cathode) and the negative ions collect at positive
electrode (anode).
• This phenomenon is called electrolysis. It is chemical effect of current. The
process of coating of a base metal with a layer of more expensive metal, is
called electroplating.
• Domestic Electrification
• From the distribution, the two terminals are
supplied to the houses named as live and neutral
(neutral is earthed at local substation). The third
terminal is introduced as the earth for the safety in
the building.
• Lightning Appliance
• The electric discharge occurring between two
charged clouds or between a charged cloud and
earth can damage the houses or buildings. To
protect this lightning conductors are used.
• POTENTIAL ENERGY
 The energy of a body due to its position or change in shape is known
as potential energy.
• P.E = MGH
 Where, M = mass of the body
 G= acceleration due to gravity
 H= height of the body above a reference point
Potential Energy changes to Electrical Energy
LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed by a
chemical reaction.
It can only change forms.
CIRCUITS
• SIMPLE CIRCUITS
 It has a cell, a lamp and a switch.
 When the switch is closed, the
lamp lights up. This is because
there is a continuous path of
metal for the electric current to
flow around.
POWER
• It is the rate at which energy is transferred or transformed. It is measured
in Watt (W).
• Ex- Most of the appliances at our home are rated in Watt or Joule per
second.
• Power = Work done/Time taken
MEASURING POWER
• Power is equal to the current times the potential difference.
P=IV
• If the current through the motor is 3.0 and the potential
difference is 120v. What is the motor’s power ?
• Solution: Power = Current × Potential Difference
 = 3 C/s × 120 J/C
 = 360 J/s = 360 W
Electrical Resistance
• The resistance to the flow of
electrical charges.
• Resistance is directly
proportional to the length and
temperature, inversely
proportional to area. (whereas,
rho is the resistivity of the
substance or material)
OHM’S LAW
• The potential difference, v, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an
electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it,
provided its temperature remains the same. This is called ohm’s law. In
other words –
• V ∝ I (12.4) or V/I = constant = R or V = IR
• For many conductors, current depends on :
• VOLTAGE - Current is directly proportional to Voltage.
• RESISTANCE - Current is indirectly proportional to resistance, the more is
the resistance, the less is the current. It is denoted by Ω(ohms). It is also
defined as the ratio of potential difference to current.
Electrical Resistance
• Conductors such as a metallic wire offer some obstruction when electric
current flows through it. This character of conductors to offer obstruction
is called its electrical resistance. The resistance (R) of a wire of a given
material depends on its length (l) and area of cross-section (a).
• R= ρ (l/a); ρ is a constant called the resistivity of the material of the wire.
• With increasing temperature, resistivity of a good conductor increases
whereas resistivity of a semiconductor decreases.
• Variable Resistance
 A component used to regulate current without changing the voltage
source is called variable resistance.
• Rheostat
 It is often used to change the resistance in the circuit.
Resistivity of Various Materials
• Resistivity of a material depends on the temperature and nature of the
material depends on temperature and nature of the material.
• It is independent of dimensions of the conductor, i.e., length, area of
cross-section etc.
• Resistivity of metals increases with increase in temperature.
• The materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators
depending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.
• Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10−8Ω to 10−6Ω.
Resistivity of Various Materials
• At the other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having
resistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more.
• In between the two are the semiconductors. These, however, have
resistivities characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature.
• The resistivities of semiconductors are also affected by presence of small
amount of impurities. This last feature is exploited in use of
semiconductors for electronic devices.
Resistivity of Various Materials
• Commercially produced resistors for domestic use or in laboratories are of
two major types : wire bound resistors and carbon resistors.
• Wire bound resistors are made by winding the wires of an alloy, viz.,
manganin, constantan, nichrome or similar ones.
• The choice of these materials is dictated mostly by the fact that their
resistivities are relatively insensitive to temperature.
Resistivity of Various Materials
• These resistances are typically in the range of
a fraction of an ohm to a few hundred ohms.
• Resistors in the higher range are made mostly
from carbon.
• Carbon resistors are compact, inexpensive and
thus find extensive use in electronic circuits.
Carbon resistors are small in size and hence
their values are given using a colour code.
• The resistivities of semiconductors decrease
with increasing temperatures.
Resistance in Series and Parallel
• Resistance in Series
 In series connection, voltage changes while the current remains
the same.
R = R1 +R2 + R3
• Resistance In Parallel
 In parallel connection, voltage remain same while the current
changes.
1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 +…….. 1/Rn
Question
• A 30V battery is connected to a circuit with a current of 10A. What
is the resistance in this set up ?
• Solution: R= 30V/10A = 3 V/A OR 3Ω
Series Circuits
• In series circuits, current can
only take one path.
• The amount of current is the
same at all points in a series
circuit.
Parallel Circuits
• The current can take more than
one path. Because there are
multiple branches, the current is
not the same at all points in a
parallel circuit.
• If one bulb ‘blows’ there is still be a
complete circuit to the bulb so it
stays alight.
MEASURING CURRENT
• Electric current is measured in Ampere (A) using an ammeter
connected in series in the circuit.
MEASURING VOLTAGE
• The ‘electrical push’ which the cell gives to the current is called the
voltage. It is measured in Volts(V) on a voltmeter. Different cells produce
different voltages. The bigger the voltage supplied by the cell, the bigger
the current. In series circuit, voltage get divided.
VT= V1+V2+ V3 +…Vn
• While in parallel, it is same at all point.
VT= V1=V2= V3 =…Vn
• Unlike an ammeter, a voltmeter is connected across the components.
• Scientist, usually use the term potential difference, when they talk about
voltage.
Three Circuit Law
• It contains 3 laws:-
 OHM’s Law
 Kirchhoff’s Current Law: The total
current into a junction equals the
total current out of the junction.
 Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law: The total
voltage drop (or gain) around any
loop of a circuit is zero.
Direct Current vs. Alternating Current
• DIRECT CURRENT- If the voltage is maintained between two points in a
circuit, charge will flow in one direction – from high to low potential. (ExBattery-powered circuits, Electrified railway lines)
• ALTERNATING CURRENT – If the high and low voltage terminals switch
locations periodically, the current will flow “back and forth” in the circuit.
(Ex - Circuits powered by electrical outlets, domestic electricity)
Direct Current vs. Alternating Current
Converting AC to DC
• AC is converted to dc using devices called DIODES, which allow
charges to move in only one direction.
Magnetic Effect of a Current
• In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted
accidently discovered that a compass
needle deflected when the current was
switched on.
• Magnetic field around a wire carrying
current
 A current carrying straight conductor
has magnetic field in the form of
concentric circles around it. Magnetic
field of current carrying straight
conductor can be shown by magnetic
field lines.
Magnetic Effect of a Current
 The direction of magnetic field through a
current carrying conductor depends upon
the direction of flow of electric current.
The direction of magnetic field gets
reversed in case of a change in the
direction of electric current.
 Let a current carrying conductor be
suspended vertically and the electric
current is flowing from south to north. In
this case, the direction of magnetic field
will be anticlockwise. If the current is
flowing from north to south, the direction
of magnetic field will be clockwise.
Magnetic Effect of a Current
 The magnetic field of a long, straight current-carrying wire is
stronger:
 When it is closer to the wire,
 or When a larger current flows through the wire.
Uses of Electromagnets
• An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the
magnetic field is produced by an electric current.
• Electromagnets usually consist of wire wound into a coil.
• A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is
concentrated in the hole in the center of the coil.
• The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned
off.
• The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core
made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such
as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux
and makes a more powerful magnet.
Electric Bell
• The electromagnet forms the core of the
electric bell. When the bell button is pressed,
the circuit is closed and current flows. The
electromagnet becomes magnetized, attracting
the soft iron ammature and the hammer
strikes the gong.
• However, the circuit will break and the
electromagnet loses its magnetism and the
springy metal strip pull back the armature and
the circuit is closed again. The process repeats.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
• A popular method of medical
imaging that provides views of
tissues in the body. It is a huge
scanner containing a solenoid
made of superconductors.
Domestic Electric Installation
• Electricity is supplied to houses by using two cables, the “live” cable
and the “neutral” cable.
• A third cable is also used for safety purposes. It is called the “earth”
and is connected to the earth terminal provided in the building.
• From the meter installed in a house, connections are made to the
distribution board through a main fuse and a main switch.
Fuse
• A fuse is a short piece of wire that has a low melting point.
• It is generally made of a tin-lead alloy.
• Fuse melts and breaks whenever there is short circuiting, overloading,
voltage fluctuation, etc. This will protect the electrical appliances and also
prevents fire accidents. Fuses are always connected in the live wire.
Nowadays, miniature circuit breakers (M CBs) are replacing fuses.
• A circuit breaker automatically protects an electrical circuit from damage
caused by overload or short circuit. Unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker need
not be replaced. It needs to be reset manually to resume normal
operation.
Domestic Electric Installation (parts)
• Earth
 The earth wire is used for
safeguarding of electrical
appliances against shocks.
• Flexible Cables
 All electrical appliances comes
with three-core flexible cables.
 The cables insulations are
coloured red or brown (for live
connection), black or light blue
(for neutral connection), and
green or yellow (for earth
connection).
Plugs, Sockets and Switches
• In a three pin plug, one pin is longer and
thicker, and the other two are similar.
The longer pin is used for earthing and it
is connected to the green wire of the
appliance. The other pins are connected
to the red (or brown) and the black (or
blue) wires.
• As the earth pin is longer, an appliance is
always first earthed before it is
connected to the live circuit.
Plugs, Sockets and Switches
• In a socket, the lower right hole is used for
the live connection and the left hole is for
the neutral connection, and the top bigger
hole is for the earth.
• All switches in a house are connected to
the live wires. If they are connected in the
neutral wire, the sockets would remain live
even if the switches are in off position.
Electric Light
• Incandescent Lamp or Filament Lamp
• In electric lamps, electrical energy is converted to
light energy.
• In electric lamps, a tungsten filament is
connected between two lead-in wires.
• The tungsten filament is heated with passage of
current and emits light.The reason for use of
tungsten is it has a high melting point of 3,400°C.
• The electric lamp also contains a small quantity of
argon (an inert gas) to prevent evaporation of
tungsten. Air is not used as it would oxidise the
tungsten.
Electric Light
• Fluorescent Tubes
• A fluorescent tube consists of mercury vapours at low pressure. When electricity
flows through the tube, the mercury vapours emit invisible ultraviolet rays. These
ultraviolet rays fall on the fluorescent coating on the inside of the tube and emit
visible light. In a fluorescent tube very little heat is produced, so almost all the
electrical energy is converted to light energy. The fluorescent tubes are cheaper
and efficient.
Electric Light
• Compact Fluorescent Lamps
• In incandescent light bulbs, lot of electricity is
wasted in the form of heat. A CFL (compact
fluorescent lamp) is a miniature fluorescent
tube that works 4 to 6 times more efficient than
an incandescent bulb. A 15W fluorescent bulb
can produce the same amount of light as a 60W
incandescent bulb. Mercury used in the
fluorescent lamps is a hazardous substance.
Most light sources including fluorescent bulbs
emit a small amount of UV, but it is far less than
the amount produced by natural daylight.
Cost of Electricity
• Electricity consumption is measured in the unit kWh. From the
power rating of electrical appliances, we can calculate the
consumption of electrical energy. By knowing the rate per unit, one
can work out the cost of consumption.
Working of Some Electronic Devices
• TV Remote Control
• A TV or music system remote control contains
a chip (an integrated circuit) and other
components, such as a diode, a transistor,
capacitor, etc. When a key is pressed, remote
control translates it into infra-red
signals which are received by the electronic
circuit in the TV, and the desired operation is
performed.
Working of Some Electronic Devices
• Cordless Phone
• Cordless phones are directly plugged into an existing
telephone socket that essentially serves as a wireless
extension to the existing phone wiring. A cordless
phone has two parts viz. a base unit and a hand set.
The hand set can communicate with a number of
frequencies (channels) in the 46-48 MHz bands. Based
on the quality, a cordless phone can permit mobility
(range) up to 100 m.

Demand and Supply
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Economics
• Economics is the science which studies human behavior in areas of
consumption, production and exchange.
• Adam Smith is the father of Economics. Book : Wealth of Nations
• Depending on its ‘scope’ of study, economics is subdivided into:
 Microeconomics : when the economics study relates to an individual
unit or part of the economy. Focus on Production, Consumption,
Supply-Demand, Price Determination
 Macroeconomics : - When the study relates to the whole / aggregate
economy.
 Ragner Frisch divided the Economics into two.
Macroeconomics
• It gained focus after the British economist John Maynard Keynes
published ‘The General Theory of Employment, Interest & Money’
(1936).
• Focus on Income, Savings, Investment, Unemployment, GDP,
Inflation, Budget, Balance of Payment etc.
Goods Types
Free Goods : Item of consumption (such as air) that is useful to people, is naturally in
abundant supply, and needs no conscious effort to obtain it.
In contrast, an economic good is scarce in relation to its demand and human effort is
required to obtain it. Yes, one person buying textbook means less units of text books
avaialble
Public Goods : a commodity or service that is provided without profit to all members of a
society, either by the government or by a private individual or organization.
Examples of public goods include knowledge, lighthouses, national defense, flood control
systems, and street lighting etc.
These goods can be sub-classified into:
A. Merit Good : a commodity or service, such as education, that is regarded by society
or government as deserving public finance. e.g. textbook & ebooks or
B. Demerit Good : a good with negative impact on the consumers' welfare. Also usually
have negative externalities. e.g. tobacco & violent video games.
Demand Types for Economic Good
• Individual Demand: Demand by one person / household e.g. 10 kg onion.
• Market Demand: Total Sum of all households’ demands e.g. 1 lakh kg onions + 1
lakh kg Potatoes..
• Ex Ante: Actual need of a consumer. He wanted to buy 10 kg onion
• Ex Post: Need of consumer changed due to market factors. Although he wanted to
buy 10 kg but bought only 5 kg due to price rise/supply shortage.
• Joint Demand: terms used together and bought together. E.g. Car-Petrol, TeaSugar, Bread-Butter, Cigarette-lighter. These are examples of ‘joint-demand’.
• Composite Demand: Total demand of a good with multiple alternative uses.
 E.g. Steel  demanded by spoons & cutlery factories, pipe makers,
automobile industry etc.
Demand Types for Economic Good
• Derived Demand: Customer wants to buy an apartment — A builder starts
constructing an apartment, then
 It leads to demand of steel + wood + cement = this is ‘derived
demand’.
 Also leads to demand of Land + Labour + Capital to build that
apartment.
 Therefore, ‘Demand for factors of production’ is said to be a ‘derived
demand’.
Demand & Supply
• Demand Curve
 The demand curve is defined as the
relationship between the price of the good
and the amount or quantity the consumer
is willing and able to purchase in a
specified time period, given constant levels
of the other determinants--tastes, income,
prices of related goods, expectations, and
number of buyers.
Determinants of Demand
1. Price of the good
2. Taste or level of desire for the product by the buyer
3. Income of the buyer
4. Prices of related products:
1. substitute products (directly competes with the good in the opinion of the buyer; e.g.
tea & coffee)
2. complementary products (used with the good in the opinion of the buyer; e.g. car &
petrol)
5. Future expectations:
 expected income of the buyer
 expected price of the good.
Elasticity
• Elasticity of Demand – Elasticity measures how much the quantity will
change in percentage terms for a 1% change in the price, and is thus
important in determining how revenue will change.
• Inelastic demand curve is steep : example is foodgrains – even if the price
is increased a lot, people will not cut down on eating foodgrain; and if P
decreases, people will not start eating more!
Normal Good
• For normal goods (bread, butter, soap,
shampoo, ice-cream etc.), following could
happen:
• Demand may be Perfectly inelastic (eP=0)
 When increase or decrease in price
doesn’t change demand.
 E.g. If a company had monopoly on
drinking water. Demand will be inelastic,
because people will be (forced) to buy
about the same amount whether the
price drops or rises. Here slope will be
vertical.
Demand may be (Relatively) inelastic (eP<1)
• Price change by 40% = demand
falls, BUT by less than 10%
• E.g. Milk because no close
substitute, Railways by
monopoly, Tobacco by addiction.
Demand may be (Relatively) elastic (eP>1)
• Price ▲ by 10% = demand ▼ by
more than 10%
• Happens if close substitutes
available
• e.g. if Pizza Hut’s Pizza gets
expensive then people start eating
Domino’s and Pizza Hut’s demand
falls significantly.
• If new substitutes is there more fall
in original item’s demand
Demand may be Unitary elastic (Ep=1)
• For a good when price increased by 10% = demand falls
by 10%; and when price decreased by 20% = demand
increases by 20%, then its Elasticity of Demand with
respect to price is ‘Unitary’ = 1.
• Here Price rise (y-axis) vs quantity demanded (x-axis):
Curve shape= Rectangular Hyperbola (Banana shape )

Giffen Good: Higher Price = ↑ Demand;
Lower Price = ↓ Demand
• If there is an inferior good without substitutes e.g. potato, rice, jowar,
bajra then its higher prices will increase the demand (because poor people
fear even more shortage in future, and they don’t have any ‘alternative’
food to to replace potato, rice.)
• So they’ll demand (& buy) more quantity as buffer.
Type of Goods
• Veblen and Giffen goods are special type of goods which do not follow law of demand.
 In Veblen Good: higher price = higher demand, lower price will decrease demand
because ‘status symbol effect will decline’ but it’ll still not greatly decrease demand,
because people will still buy paintings / i-phones for their resale value in future.
 In Giffen Good: lower price = greater fall in demand because people prefer to use
income for better quality foods so ‘income effect’ dominates. e.g. potato, rice, jowar,
bajra
 Normal goods : Higher price, lower demand and vice-versa. Whole wheat, organic
pasta noodles
 Inferior Goods : Higher Income -> lower demand e.g. Kerosene, coarse grains and vice
versa.
 Superior goods are a type of normal goods whose demand increases when consumer's
income improves. Bus, metro, ola, uber etc.
Supply
• The quantity of a commodity which a firm is
willing to sell at a particular price
• Follows the ‘supply curve’
• Higher the price, greater the incentive for the
firm to sell more Supply will increase
• Profit = Total Revenue – Total Cost
Laws of Demand and Supply
Law of Demand – When price increases, quantity demanded (Qd) decreases
Law of Supply – When price increases, quantity supplied (Qs) also increases
Effects on Supply
• 1. Cost of production – if it increases, supply decreases
• Shifts in the Supply Curve
 If cost of production increases, quantity supplied will reduce 
Supply curve will shift leftwards and vice versa.
• 2. Taxes
 If taxes increase, supply will reduce, and the supply curve will shift
leftwards
 3.Elasticity (Es) = (% change in quantity supplied) / (% change in price)
o If Es>1 => supply is elastic
o If Es<1 => supply is inelastic
Determinants of elasticity of supply
• Overall determinant is choice – more the choice with the firm,
higher the elasticity
• e.g. Perishable quantities – firm has no option/choice to store; has
to sell at any price
• Similarly for agricultural commodities – inelastic supply
Market Equilibrium
• Quantity demanded = quantity supply
• Equilibrium point = point of intersection of demand and supply
curves
• Ideal situation – both buyers and sellers derive maximum utility and
satisfaction from this point
• Markets comprise of two groups – buyers and sellers
 Buyers want lower prices to maximize their satisfaction
 Sellers want higher profits
Market Equilibrium
• Reducing the price below the equilibrium will lead to shortage 
Price will automatically go up, in the interest of both the groups
• Increasing the price about the equilibrium will lead to over-supply
 Suppliers will reduce the price in order to sell all the stock
Consumer’s and Producer’s Equilibrium
• Consumer’s equilibrium is the situation where a consumer spends
his income on various commodities in such a manner that he gets
maximum satisfaction
• Producer’s equilibrium is the situation where a firm produces that
level of output which provides it maximum profits
Who fixes the price in the market?
• Buyers, sellers, government or nobody?
 It happens automatically through ‘market mechanism’!
 Also called Price Mechanism or the ‘invisible hand’ (Adam Smith)
 Adam Smith is called the father of Economics (Book – An inquiry into
the nature and the causes of the wealth of nations, 1776)
 Wealth of nations is the first book on Economics, separating it from
Philosophy
 Though Kautilya’s Arthshashtra dealt with Economics, it was primarily
about statecraft
Impact of change in Demand & Supply
• When supply increases, price decreases
 e.g. More supply of agricultural produce in the mandis
• When demand increases, price increases
 e.g. Price of fruits during Navratra
Question
• Why are the prices of agricultural commodities volatile?
 Because of inelasticity of demand & supply
 You don’t start eating more just because price is less!
 Producers anyway have to sell of their agri products at any price
(perishable goods)
Paradox of poverty of farmers
• If crops fail, farmers have nothing to sell and the farmers lose
income
• But even when there are bumper crops, their income reduces!
 Farmers lose in both the cases
Question
• Why do producers prefer to burn or sink the bumper crops, rather
than sell?
 Because if they export all, the supply will increase, price will
come down, bringing down overall income.
Minimum Support Price
• Justification of Minimum Support Price by the government
 If the govt. doesn’t intervene, both farmers and consumers will
lose
 With govt willing to buy ALL quantity at an attractive price
(MSP), the farmers won’t be incurring losses
 It will reduce the fluctuation in prices, even in the case of
overproduction
Minimum Support Price
• However, MSP is announced only for important crops (24 in number)
 If govt will announce MSP for all (even potato, tomato etc), it will have
to buy unlimited quantity of all these
 Not enough storage for all the crops
 Only those crops which are crucial to food security are supported by
MSP
• Difference between MSP & Procurement Price
 MSP = Guarantee to buy unlimited quantity at this price for selected
crops
Minimum Support Price
• Procurement Price = Guarantee to buy only limited quantity for
distribution in PDS & buffer storage
 MSP = Usually below the market price (though not much below)
• Procurement Price = At or above the market price
 MSP Objective = Protect the interest of farmers in case of
overproduction
Minimum Support Price
• Procurement Price Objective = Protect the interest of both, the
consumers (through PDS)& farmers
 MSP announced before sowing
• Procurement Price announced after harvest
 Central Govt announces both these prices on the
recommendation by Commission of Agricultural Costs & Prices
(CACP); state govts also consulted
Pricing of Shares
• Share market is a form of Capital Markets, which comprises of
Primary & Secondary Markets
 Security is the general term for all kinds of financial assets;
share is also a security
 Primary Market – First time selling of shares - Initial Public Offer
(IPO)
o Sold by firms to investors
 Secondary Market – Existing shares are sold again
o Sold by one investor to another
Pricing of Shares
 Shareholders are owners to the extent of the total value of their
shares
o They get proportion of the profits (called dividends) in return
o They can’t sell it back to the company (usually) – can only
transfer it to other investors
 Primary Market – price determined by the company
 Secondary Market – price determined by Demand & Supply
equations
Pricing of Shares
o The place where the transactions between buyers & sellers
happen is called stock exchange
o Money given to the company in order to invest in long term
growth
o Enables people to convert the shares into cash (provides
liquidity to the existing securities)
 SEBI regulates both, primary and secondary markets
 In a stock market, shares are auctioned
o Buyers created demand, sellers create supply
Pricing of Shares
• Demand curves are constructed on the basis of bids placed by
interested buyers
• Supply curves are constructed on the basis of the willingness of the
sellers to sell at a particular price
Pricing of Shares
• Impact of positive news on share price
 Buyers will become optimistic about the company’s prospects
 Demand will increase, shifting the demand curve rightwards
 This increases the price
 But fewer sellers will be there because they will hold on to the
shares (good future prospects)
 Supply curve will shift leftwards
 Therefore price will go up
Indices of Stock Exchanges
• Shows performance of the companies listed on that stock exchange
through a representative group of companies (BSE – Sensex,
comprising of 30 stocks; NSE – Nifty, comprising of 50 stocks)
• Market Capitalization = Number of shares x Share Price
• Demand & Supply depends on the perception of the investors
regarding future performance of the company
Indices of Stock Exchanges
• Perception of the future depends on
1) Past & current performance of the company,
2) Govt Policy (liberal policy will help the company’s performance),
3) Foreign Investment (if its high, the share price will go up),
4) Global factors (e.g. 2008 Financial Crisis caused a global crash of
stock markets),
5) Macro Economic Factors (GDP, Inflation) and
6) Political Factors
Indices of Stock Exchanges
• If the Sensex goes up, can we say with certainty that the economic
performance of the country will be good in the future?
 We cannot be SURE, but chances are high that the overall
performance will be good
 Stock markets are based on perception and sentiments – they
are right most of the time, but not all the time!
Utility, Preferences & Misc.
• Need: demand of a particular good whose absence will cause death
e.g. Food / Water / Air.
• Want/Desire : demand of a good whose absence may not cause
death e.g. Shelter, Clothing, Mobile etc.
• Utility: power of a good to satisfy your ‘need / want / desire’. Utility
is relative in nature. Hungry man will value a Roti more than a nonhungry man. Utility is free of morality & ethics. Customer buys knife
for cutting vegetables or doing murder- utility doesn’t say it’s ‘right’
or ‘wrong’.
Marginal and Total Utility
• Marginal Utility (MU) : It is the additional satisfaction from
consuming one more unit. Marginal utility is usually decreasing
because with every piece of biscuit your belly will start to fill up &
your hunger will start to decrease. (However this law does not
apply to a mad collector of rare stamps or a miser who likes
accumulating wealth etc.)
• Total Utility (TU) = Sum of Marginal Utilities (MU). When total
utility is maximum, marginal utility is zero. Beyond this point, total
utility will decline and marginal utility will enter negative zone.

Development of Education
during British Period in
India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Education in British India
• Initially, British East India Company was not concerned with the
development of education system because their prime motive was trading
and profit-making.
• To rule in India, they planned to educate a small section of upper and
middle classes to create a class “Indian in blood and colour but English in
taste” who would act as interpreters between the Government and the
masses.
• This was also called the “downward filtration theory”.
Development of Modern Education
• The following steps and measures were taken by the British for the development of
Education in India.
• The company wanted some educated Indians who could assist them in the
administration of the land.
• Also, they wanted to understand the local customs and laws well.
• For this purpose, Warren Hastings established the Calcutta Madrassa in 1781 for the
teaching of Muslim law.
• In 1791, a Sanskrit College was started in Varanasi by Jonathan Duncan for the study of
Hindu philosophy and laws.
• The missionaries supported the spread of Western education in India primarily for their
activities. They established many schools with education only being a means to an end
which was Christianising and ‘civilising’ the natives.
Development of Modern Education
• The Baptist missionary William Carey had come to India in 1793 and by 1800 there
was a Baptist Mission in Serampore, Bengal, and also a number of primary schools
there and in nearby areas.
• The Indian reformers believed that to keep up with times, a modern educational
system was needed to spread rational thinking and scientific principles.
• Followings were the Acts passed by Britishers.
1813 Act & the Education
• 1. Charles Grant and William Wilberforce, who was missionary activists,
compelled the East India Company to give up its non-invention policy and make
way for spreading education through English in order to teach western literature
and preach Christianity.
• Hence, the British Parliament added a clause in 1813 charter that GovernorGeneral-in-Council less than one lakh for education and allowed the Christian
Missionaries to spread their religious ideas in India.
• 2. Act had its own importance because it was first instance that British East India
Company acknowledged for the promotion of education in India.
• 3. With the efforts of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the Calcutta College was established
for imparting Western education. Also three Sanskrit colleges were set up at
Calcutta.
General Committee of Public Instruction, 1823
• This committee was formed to look after the development of education in India
which was dominated by Orientalists who were the great supporter of Oriental
learning rather than the Anglican.
• As a result, spread of education in India got discursive between OrientalistAnglicist and Macaulay’s resolution come across with clear picture of British
education system.
Lord Macaulay’s Education Policy, 1835
• In 1835, it was decided that western sciences and literature would be
imparted to Indians through the medium of English by Lord William
Bentinck’s government.
• Bentinck had appointed Thomas Babington Macaulay as the Chairman of
the General Committee of Public Instruction.
• Macaulay was an ardent anglicist who had absolute contempt for Indian
learning of any kind. He was supported by Reverend Alexander Duff, JR
Colvin, etc.
• On the side of the orientalists were James Prinsep, Henry Thomas
Colebrooke, etc.
Lord Macaulay’s Education Policy, 1835
• Macaulay minutes refer to his proposal of education for the Indians.
• According to him:
 English education should be imparted in place of traditional Indian
learning because oriental culture was ‘defective’ and ‘unholy’.
 He believed in education a few upper and middle class students.
 In course of time, education would trickle down to the masses. This
was called infiltration theory.
 He wished to create a class of Indians who were Indian in colour and
blood but English in taste and affiliation.
Lord Macaulay’s Education Policy, 1835
• In 1835, the Elphinstone College (Bombay) and the Calcutta Medical
College were established.
• This policy was an attempt to create that system of education which
educates only upper strata of society through English.
• English become court language and Persian was abolished as court
language.
• Printings of English books were made free and available at very low price.
• English education gets more fund as compare to oriental learning.
• In 1849, JED Bethune founded Bethune School.
• Agriculture Institute was established at Pusa (Bihar).
• Engineering Institute was established at Roorkee.
Wood’s Dispatch, 1854
• Sir Charles Wood was the President of the Board of Control of the
company in 1854 when he sent a dispatch to the then Governor-General
of India, Lord Dalhousie.
• It is considered as the “Magna Carta of English Education in India” and
contained comprehensive plan for spreading education in India.
• Recommendations of the Wood’s Despatch:
 Regularise education system from the primary to the university levels.
 Indians were to be educated in English and their native language.
 Education system was to be set up in every province.
 Every district should have at least one government school.
Wood’s Dispatch, 1854
 Affiliated private schools could be granted aids.
 Education of women should be emphasised.
 Universities of Madras, Calcutta and Bombay were set up by 1857.
 University of Punjab – 1882; University of Allahabad – 1887
 This despatch asked the government to take up the responsibility of education of the
people.
• It states the responsibility of State for the spread of education to the masses.
• It recommended the hierarchy education level- At bottom, vernacular primary school; at
district, Anglo-vernacular High Schools and affiliated college, and affiliated universities of
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras Presidency.
• Recommended English as a medium of instruction for higher studies and vernacular at
school level
Hunter Commission (1882-83)
• It was formed to evaluate the achievements of Wood Dispatch of 1854 under W.W
Hunter in 1882.
• It underlined the state’s role in the extension and improvement of primary
education and secondary education.
• It underlined the transfer of control to district and municipal boards.
• It recommended two division of secondary education- Literary up to university;
Vocational for commercial career.
Sadler Commission 1917
1. It was formed to study on the problems Calcutta University and their recommendations
were applicable to other universities also.
2. Their observations were as follows:
 12-year school course and 3-years degree after the intermediate stage
 Centralised functioning of universities, unitary residential-teaching autonomous
body.
 Recommended extended facilities for applied scientific and technological education,
teacher’s training and female education.
• Hence, we can say the British education system were influence by the aspiration of
Christian Missionaries. It was injected to ensure a cheap supply of educated Indians to
increase a number of subordinate posts in administration and in British business concern.
That’s why, they emphasis on English as a medium of instruction and also to glorified
British conquerors and their administration.
Assessment of the British efforts on education
• Although there were a few Englishmen who wanted to spread education
for its own sake, the government was chiefly concerned only with its own
concerns.
• There was a huge demand for clerks and other administrative roles in the
company’s functioning.
• It was cheaper to get Indians rather than Englishmen from England for
these jobs. This was the prime motive.
• No doubt it spread western education among Indians, but the rate of
literacy was abysmally low during British rule.
Assessment of the British efforts on education
• The state of women education was pathetic. This was because the
government did not want to displease the orthodox nature of Indians and
also because women could not generally be employed as clerks.
• In 1911, illiteracy rate in British India was 94%. In 1921, it was 92%.
• Scientific and technical education was ignored by the British government.

Development of Indian
Press under Brithish Rule
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Indian Press under the British Rule
• During the reign of the British Empire, there were several Acts passed as stringent
curbs over the Indian Press.
• Prior to the rumblings of the 1857 mutiny, the Press was fiercely involved in rallying
the masses and a nationalistic rebellion was slowly being pieced together through
words and symbols.
• What really worried these Company’s officers was the apprehension that these
newspapers might reach London and expose their misdoings to the Home
authorities.
• In the absence of press laws, the newspapers were at the mercy of the Company’s
officials.
• The Government sometimes enforced pre-censorship, sometimes deported the
offending editor for anti-government policies
The Censorship of the Press Act, 1799
• Lord Wellesley imposed Censorship of the Press Act, 1799, imposed
almost wartime restrictions on the press.
• These regulations required:
• The newspaper was to clearly print in every issue the name of the printer,
the editor and the proprietor to submit all material for pre-censorship to
the Secretary to the Government.
• The breach of these rules was punishable with immediate deportation.
• In 1807 the Censorship Act was extended to cover journals, pamphlets and
even books.
Licensing Regulations, 1823
• It was enacted by the John Adams.
• According to this regulation, press without licence was a penal offence.
• The restriction was directed mainly to Indian language newspapers or
those edited by the Indians.
Press Act of 1835 or Metcalfe Act
• Metcalfe (Governor General – 1835 – 36) repealed the obnoxious 1823
ordinance and was named, “liberator of the Indian press.”
• The new Press Act (1835) required a printer/publisher to give a precise
account of premises of a publication and cease functioning, if required by
a similar declaration.
• The result of a liberal press policy was a rapid growth of newspapers.
• But soon he became a victim of party politics in England and was
succeeded by Lord Auckland in 1836.
Licensing Act, 1857
• This act imposed licensing restriction and the right to stop
publication and circulation of book, newspaper or printed
matter reserved with the Government.
Registration Act, 1867
• This act relaxed the restrictions put by Metcalf‘s Act of 1835
and hence states that Government acts as regulatory not
restrictive body.
Vernacular Press Act, 1878
• The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 was enacted to curtail the freedom of
the Indian-languages’ press.
• Lord Lytton was being bitterly criticized for the Second Anglo-Afghan War
(1878–80).
• So, he promulgated the act with an aim to prevent the vernacular press
from expressing criticism of British policies under him.
• The act excluded English-language publications and was against the strong
and sustained protests from a wide spectrum of the Indian population.
Vernacular Press Act, 1878
• It was nicknamed the ‘Gagging Act’.
• For the first time, any Act empowered the Government to issue search
warrants, and enter newspaper premises even without court orders.
• The law was repealed in 1881 by Lytton’s successor, Lord Ripon.
• However, the resentment it produced among Indians became one of the
catalysts giving rise to India’s growing independence movement.
Indian Newspaper Act, 1908
• The adverse comments of the newspapers against the government led it
to follow a repressive policy and enacted the Newspapers (Incite to
Offences) Act, 1908.
• Magistrates were empowered to confiscate printing press, property
connected to of newspapers, which published objectionable materials
serving as incitement to murder or acts of violence.
• The newspapers editors and the printers were given the option to appeal
to the High Court within fifteen days of the order of the penalty of the
Press.
Indian Press Act, 1910
• This act was a revision of the Vernacular Act that empowered the local
government to demand a security at registration from the
printer/publisher and forfeit/deregister if it was an offending newspaper,
and the printer of a newspaper was required to submit two copies of each
issue to local government.
Press Committee, 1921
• In 1921, on the recommendations of a Press Committee
chaired by Tej Bahadur Sapru, the Press Acts of 1908 and 1910
were repealed.
Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931
• This Act gave sweeping powers to provincial governments to suppress
propaganda for Civil Disobedience Movement.
• It was further amplified in 1932 to include all activities calculated to
undermine government authority
Press Enquiry Committee, 1947
• The Committee was set up to examine press laws in the light of
fundamental rights formulated by the Constituent Assembly.
• It recommended repeal of Indian Emergency Powers Act, 1931,
amendments in Press and Registration of Books Act.

Development of Judicial
system during British India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• India has a single unified and integrated judicial system and Supreme
Court of India is at the apex court of the Indian judicial system.
• During ancient times, the concept of justice was linked with religion i.e.
according to his status (varna).
• In medieval times, the dictum ‘King can do no wrong’ was applied and the
King arrogated to himself an important role in administering justice.
Mayor’s Courts
• The story of India’s modern judiciary begins with the Mayor’s courts.
• Under the Royal Charter of 1661, the Governor-in-Council of each
Presidency (Madras and Surat) were empowered ‘to judge all persons
belonging to that presidency and execute judgement accordingly’.
• In 1678, the Governor-in-Council decided that they should have two
sittings per week to hear and judge all cases concerning Europeans and
Indians as per the according to English Law.
• In 1687, another charter authorized the company to establish municipality
at Madras to mark the beginning of territorial character of Company’s rule
in Madras.
• In exercise of this power, the company established a municipality.
• The Mayor and Aldermen were recognized as a “Court of Record” with power
to try the civil and criminal cases in their territories.
• The Mayor and three of the twelve Aldermen were so called to be the “Justices
of the Peace”.
• Similar courts were established in successive presidencies at Bombay and
Calcutta.
• Under the Charter of 1726, a Mayor’s court was established at each presidency
town viz. Madras, Bombay and Calcutta.
• The terms in the charter made is implicit that English Law had to be applied in
the Mayor’s Courts in India.
• However, meanwhile French occupied Madras and this system remained
suspended till 1749 when French surrendered Madras back.
• The Charter of 1753 was passed later to remove the difficulties of previous
charter including the courts.
• Under the new charter, the Mayor’s courts were put under the Governorin-council to avoid disputes between the two.
• However, still judiciary suffered from lack of legal knowledge,
overburdened executive, failure of impartial judgment, lack of local judges
etc.
• The Judicial System in India was neither adopted proper procedures nor had the
proper organisation of the law court from the ancient India to Mughal India.
• The process of litigation in Hindu was served either by the caste elder or village
Panchayats or zamindars whereas for Muslim Qazi supervise the litigation
issues.
• If there were a discrepancy, the Rajas and Badshahs were considered as the
fountainhead of the justice.
• The beginning of Indian codified common law is traced back to 1726 when a
Mayor’s Court in Madras, Bombay and Calcutta was established by the East India
Company.
• This was the first sign of Company’s transformation from a trading company to a
ruling power with the added flavour of new elements of the Judiciary.
Supreme Court at Calcutta
• Regulating Act of 1773 established for the first time the Supreme Court of
Fort Williams in Calcutta in 1774, consisting of the Chief Justice and three
judges (later reduced to two)
• Appointed by the Crown acting as King’s court.
• Thus, establishment of this Supreme Court was ‘an act of reformation
rather than of innovation‘, for it was intended ‘in fact to occupy the
position of the Mayor’s Court founded in 1727 (under the Charter of
1726).
• This court was adorned with powers such as power to punish for its
contempt, power to try civil & criminal cases.
• Sir Elijah Impey was appointed as chief justice of this court.
Reforms under Warren Hastings (1772-1785 AD)
• Warren Hasting established, two court for resolving disputes –civil
disputes for District Diwani Adalat and criminal disputes for District
Fauzdari Adalats.
• District Diwani Adalat: It was established in districts to resolve the
civil disputes which were placed under the collector. In this court
Hindu law was applicable for Hindus and Muslim law for Muslim.
• If people seek more justice then they can move to Sadar Diwani
Adalat which was functioned under a president and two members
of Supreme Council.
Reforms under Warren Hastings (1772-1785 AD)
• District Fauzdari Adalats: It was set up to resolved the criminal issues
which were placed under an Indian officers assisted by Qazi and Muftis.
• The entire functioning of this court was administered by the collector. The
Muslim law was administered in this court.
• But the approval of capital punishment and for the acquisition was given
by the Sadar Nizamat Adalat which headed by a Deputy Nizam who was
assisted by the chief Qazi and Chief Mufti.
• The formation Supreme Court at Calcutta under the Regulating Act of
1773 AD had original and appellate jurisdiction.
Civil Judiciary
• Lowest Court was the Amin Court or Munsif Court for cases involving value less than Rs. 50.
• Higher was Diwani Adalat or District court headed by a Session Judge.
• Higher than Diwani Adalat was the Provincial Court of Appeal.
• Four provincial Courts of appeal were set up at Dhaka, Calcutta, Murshidabad and Patna.
• After provincial court, the Highest Court of Appeal was set up which was called “Sadar
Diwani Adalat”.
• The headquarters of Sadar Diwani Adalat was at Calcutta and it was the Highest Court of
Appeal.
• Its judge was supported by a Head Qazi, two Muftis and Two Pandits.
• The appeals from “Sadar Diwani Adalat” could be submitted to the King in England.
• The King of England only entertained those cases whose value was more than 5000 rupees.
Reforms under Cornwallis (1786-1793 AD)
• Under Cornwallis, the District Fauzadari Court was abolished and
Circuit Court was set at Calcutta, Decca, Murshidabad and Patna.
• It acts as a court of appeal for civil as well as criminal cases which
was functioned under the European judges.
• He shifted Sadar Nizamat Adalat to Calcutta and put it under the
supervision of Governor-General and the members of Supreme
Council who were assisted by Chief Qazi and Chief Mufti.
Reforms under Cornwallis (1786-1793 AD)
• The District Diwani Adalat was renamed as District, City or the
Zila Court which was functioned under a district judge.
• He also established gradation civil courts for both Hindu and
Muslim such as Munsiff Court, Registrar Court, District Court,
Sadar Diwani Adalat and King-in-Council.
• He is known for the establishment of sovereignty of law.
Reforms under William Bentinck
• Under William Bentinck, the four Circuit Courts were abolished and
transferred the functions of the abolished court to the collectors
under the supervision of the commissioner of revenue and circuit.
• Sadar Diwani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat Adalat were established at
Allahabad.
• He made the Persian and a Vernacular language for the court
proceeding in lower court and made English language as official
language for Supreme Court proceeding.
Reforms under William Bentinck
• During his reign, Law commission was set up by Macaulay
which codified the Indian laws.
• On the basis of this commission, a civil Procedure Code of
1859, an Indian Penal Code of 1860, and a Criminal Procedure
Code of 1861 were prepared.
Establishment of High Courts
• The year 1861 also constituted a conspicuous landmark in the process of
development of legal and judicial institutions in India.
• It was during this year that the steps were taken to establish High Courts at
Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.
• These High Courts were not only better instruments of justice than the
preceding courts, but also represented the amalgamation of the existing courts.
• Each high court was to consist of a Chief Justice and not more than 15 regular
judges.
• The High Courts enjoyed the same power over all persons and estates and had
original, appellate and extraordinary original jurisdiction in civil cases whereas
extraordinary and appellant jurisdiction in criminal cases.

State Policy
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

Introduction:
• The Directive Principles of State Policy are enumerated in Part IV of the
Constitution from Articles 36 to 51
• The framers of the Constitution borrowed this idea from the Irish
Constitution of 1937, which had copied it from the Spanish Constitution
• The Directive Principles along with the Fundamental Rights contain the
philosophy of the Constitution and is the soul of the Constitution.
• Dr B R Ambedkar described these principles as ‘novel features’ of the Indian
Constitution.
Directive Principles of State Policy
• The phrase ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’ denotes the ideals that the
State should keep in mind while formulating policies and enacting laws.
These are the constitutional instructions or recommendations to the State in
legislative, executive and administrative matters.
• It includes the legislative and executive organs of the central and state
governments, all local authorities and all other public authorities in the
country.
• The Directive Principles resemble the ‘Instrument of Instructions’ enumerated
in the Government of India Act of 1935.
Features of Directive Principles
• They embody the concept of a ‘welfare state’ and not that of a ‘police state’,
which existed during the colonial era.
• The Directive Principles are non-justiciable in nature, that is, they are not
legally enforceable by the courts for their violation.
• “Nevertheless, the Constitution (Article 37) itself says that these principles
are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of
the State to apply these principles in making laws.
Directive Principles of State Policy


• On the basis of their content and direction, they can be classified into three
broad categories, viz, socialistic, Gandhian and liberal–intellectual.
Socialistic Principles

honourable relations between nations; to foster respect for international
law and treaty obligations, and to encourage settlement of international
disputes by arbitration (Article 51).

original list. They require the State:
1.To secure opportunities for healthy development of children (Article 39).
2.To promote equal justice and to provide free legal aid to the poor (Article 39
A).
3.To take steps to secure the participation of workers in the management of
industries (Article 43 A).

Additional Directive Principles
44th Amendment Act
Article 38: requires the State to minimise inequalities in income, status, facilities
and opportunities

97th Amendment Act, 2011
Article 43B: It requires the state to promote voluntary formation, autonomous
functioning, democratic control and professional management of co-operative
societies.
The framers of the Constitution made the Directive Principles non-justiciable and
legally non-enforceable because:
