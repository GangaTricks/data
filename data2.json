The Sufi Movement
Mystics who are called Sufis, rose in Islam at a very early stage.
● These saints had nothing to do with the state. They laid great emphasis on love as a
bond between God and the individual soul.
● Sufi came out of the word sooph meaning wool. They advocated life of purity and
renunciation. Sufism sprang from the doctrine of Wahadat-ul-Wujud or unity of being.
This doctrine was propounded by Ibn-ul-Arabi.
● One and the earliest Sufis was Rabia, a woman.
● Sufis organised 12 orders or silsilas. A silsila was generally led by a prominent mystic,
who lived in a khanqah or hospice alongwith his disciple. The link between the teacher
or pir and his disciples or murids was a vital part of Sufism. Every pir nominated a
successor or wali to carry out his work.
● Sufi orders are broadly divided into Ba-shara that is those which followed the Islamic
law (shariat) and Be-shara, that is those which were not bound by it.

Grand Trunk from Sonargaon in Bengal
to Peshawar.

● Tarikh-i-Shershahi was written by

Shivaji (1674-80)
● Shivaji belonged to the Bhonsle Clan of
Marathas. Shivaji’s father Shahji
Bhonsle was a military commander
under Nizam Shahi ruler of
Ahmednagar.
● Shivaji was born to Jijabai in the hill
fortress of Shivner. Shivaji’s early career
and life was influenced by Jijabai, his
mother, Dadaji Kondadev, the manager
of his father’s Jagir and Guru Ramdas,
his spiritual teacher.
● Dadaji Kondadev gave him training in
civil and military administration.
● Before that, in 1646, he conquered the
fort of Torna and built forts at Raigarh
and Pratapgarh. In 1647, he assumed
full charge of his Jagir.
● In 1659, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan,
Ambassador of Ali Adil Shah (Sultan of
Bijapur), in a meeting with his tiger
paws. The Sultan then acknowledged the
independent status of Shivaji.
● Later, Shaista Khan, a Governor of
Deccan, was deputed by Aurangzeb to
put down the rising power of Shivaji in
1660. Shivaji lost Poona and suffered
several defeats, till he made a bold attack
on Shaista’s military camp at night and
plundered Surat and later Ahmednagar.
● Raja Jai Singh of Amber was then
appointed by Aurangzeb to put down
Shivaji (1665) and Jai Singh succeeded
in besieging Shivaji in the fort of
Purandhar. Consequently, the Treaty of
Purandhar (1665) was signed according
to which, Shivaji ceded some forts to the
Mughals and paid a visit to the Mughal
court at Agra. Shivaji also agreed to help
Mughals in their attack on Bijapur.
● Shivaji visited Agra with his son
Shambhaji in 1666. He was put on house
arrest but escaped from there.
● He, very soon, conquered the forts
which he had surrendered to the
Mughals. He defeated the Mughal forces
in the Battle of Salher in 1672.

THE MARATHA AGE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● He was crowned in 1674 at Raigarh and
assumed the title of Haindava
Dharmodharak (protector of Hinduism)
and Chhatrapati. He became the sovereign
ruler of Maharashtra. He died in 1680.
Shivaji’s Administration
● Shivaji divided the territories under his rule
into three provinces (prants), each under a
Viceroy. Provinces were divided into Prants,
which were subdivided into Parganas or
Tarafs. The lowest unit was village, headed
by a headman or patel.
● Shivaji was helped by Ashtapradhan (eight
ministers), which was unlike a Council of
Ministers, for there was no collective
responsibility. Each minister was directly
responsible to Shivaji.
● His administrative reforms were guided by
Malik Amber of Ahmednagar.
Shivaji’s Revenue
Administration
● Assessment of land revenue was based on
measurement. The Kathi of Amber was
adopted as the unit of measurement.
● Chauth was one-fourth of the land revenue
paid to the Marathas so as not to be
subjected to Maratha’s raid.
● Sardeshmukhi was an additional levy of 10
per cent (1/10th) on those lands of
Maharashtra, over which the Marathas
claimed hereditary right, but which formed
part of the Mughal empire.
MARATHAS AFTER
SHIVAJI
● There was a dispute of succession
between Sambhaji and Rajaram.
● Son of Shivaji, Sambhaji (1680-89)
succeeded the throne. He was an
incapable ruler and poor diplomat.
● Prince Akbar, the rebellious son of
Aurangzeb took shelter with him.
Sambhaji was executed by Aurangzeb
and his infant son, Shahu, was taken
captive by Aurangzeb. Sambhaji was
succeeded by Rajaram in 1689.
● Rajaram (1689-1700) was killed in
1700 by Aurangzeb. His widow
Tarabai put her infant son, Shivaji II,
on the throne. Rajaram created the
new Ministerial post of Pratinidhi.
Thus, total number of ministers
became nine.
● After Aurangzeb’s death in 1707,
Shahu, the grandson of Shivaji and
son of Sambhaji was released by
Bahadur Shah. He claimed the
throne and this led to a civil war
between Shahu and Tarabai. Shahu
emerged victorious in the Battle of
Khed, with the help of Balaji
Vishwanath. After this, Shahu ruled
from Satara and Tarabai from
Kolhapur. From now onwards, the
rule of Peshwa started. They became
virtual rulers of the state.
