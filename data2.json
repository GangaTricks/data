[
The Mesolithic Age
(9000 BC- 6000 BC)
● It was a transitional phase between the
Palaeolithic Age and the Neolithic Age.
● In this age, climate became warm and
dry, which brought about changes in
fauna and flora and made it possible for
human beings to move to new areas.
● The Mesolithic people lived on hunting,
fishing and food- gathering. At a later
stage, they also domesticated animals.
● The characteristic tools of the Mesolithic
Age are microliths. Microliths were small
tools made of stone pointed cresconic
blades, scrapers, etc made up of stones
were other important tools.
● Adamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and
Bagor in Rajasthan provide the earliest
evidence for the domestication of
animals.
● The people of Palaeolithic and
Mesolithic ages practiced painting.
Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh is a
striking site of Pre-historic painting of
Mesolithic age.
The Neolithic Age
(6000 BC-1800 BC)
● The people of this age are characterised
by the use of polished stone tools. They
particularly used stone axes.
● Important Neolithic sites in India
include Burzahom, Mehrgarh, Daojali
Hading, Chirand, Maski, Brahmagiri,
Hallur, Piklihal, Utnoor, Nagarjunakonda
and Paiyampalli.
● It is interesting that in Burzahom dogs
were buried with their masters in their
graves.
● The Neolithic settlers were the earliest
farming communities. They produced
ragi and horse-gram (kulathi). Neolithic
sites in Allahabad district are noted for
the cultivation of rice in the sixth
millenium BC. They domesticated
cattle, sheeps and goats. They wove
cotton and wool to make clothes.
● Hand made pottery and use of potter
wheel first appeared during the
Neolithic age.
● Neolithic men lived in caves and
decorated their walls with hunting and
dancing scenes. They knew the art of
making boats. In the later phase, people
lived a more settled life and lived in
circular and rectangular houses made of
mud and reed. Pit houses have been
found in Burzahom.
● Koldihwa in UP revealed a three
fold cultural sequence: Neolithic,
Chalcolithic and iron age. Mehargarh in
Baluchistan is the oldest Neolithic site
in India (7000 BC).
Chalcolithic Culture
(1800 BC-1000 BC)
● The end of the Neolithic period saw the
use of metals. Copper was the first metal
to be used.
● Chalcolithic culture refers to the
stone-copper phase. People also used
hand-axes and other objects made up of
copper ware.
● Chalcolithic people were primarily rural
communities. They domesticated
animals and practised agriculture. They
were not acquainted with burnt bricks
and lived in thatched houses. They
venerated the mother Goddess and
worshipped the bull.
● The people of Chalcolithic culture were
the first to use painted pottery. Black
and red pottery painted with white line
design was most popular.
● The Malwa ware is considered the
richest among the Chalcolithic
ceramics.
● Important chalcolithic sites in India are
Ahar, Jorwe, Kayatha, Malwa, Eran,
Rangpur, Navdatoli, Nevasa, Daimabad
and Inamgaon.
2 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● Indus civilisation is one of the four
earliest civilisations of the world along
with the civilisations of Mesopotamia
(Tigris and Euphrates), Egypt (Nile)
and China (Hwang Ho).
● The civilisation forms part of the
proto-history of India and belongs to the
Bronze age.
● In its mature form, the civilisation
lasted between 2600-1900 BC.
It can be divided into following sub-parts
● Early Phase 3500-2600 BC
● Middle (mature) Phase 2600-1900 BC
● Later Phase 1900-1400 BC
● Dayaram Sahni first discovered
Harappa in 1921.
● RD Banerjee discovered Mohenjodaro
or Mound of the Dead in 1922.
Nomenclature of Indus
Valley Civilisation
● Indus Valley Civilisation coined by
John Marshall as it flourished along the
Indus river.
● Harappan Civilisation after the first
discovered site, Harappa.
● Saraswati-Sindhu Civilisation as most
of the sites have been found along the
Indus-Saraswati river.
Geographical Spread
● The civilisation covered parts of Sind,
Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Punjab,
Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab
and Maharashtra.
● Mundigak and Shortughai are the two
sites located in Afghanistan.
● Western most site Sutkagendor on
Makran coast. Eastern most site
Alamgirpur in Uttar Pradesh.
● Northern most site Manda in Jammu
(River Chenab). Southern most site
Daimabad in Maharashtra (River
Pravara) are major sites.
Some New Discoveries
■ Ganverivala in Pakistan by Rafeeq Mugal.
■ Bhirrana oldest Harappan site has said to be
the mounds at Bhirrana village on the banks of
Ghaggar river.
■ Rakhigarhi in Haryana by Amarendra Nath.
Town Planning
● A unique feature was the grid system i.e.
streets cutting across one another at right
angles, dividing the town into large
rectangular blocks.

INDUS VALLEY CIVILISATION
● The towns were divided into two
parts: upper part or citadel and lower
part.
● The fortified citadel on the Western
side housed public buildings and
members of ruling class.
● Below the citadel on the Eastern side,
lay the lower town inhabited by the
common people.
● Underground Drainage System
connected all houses to the street
drains made of mortar, lime and
gypsum. They were covered with
either brick or stone slabs and
equipped with ‘Manhole’. This shows
developed sense of health and
sanitation.
● The Great Bath (Mohenjodaro) It
was used for religious bathing. Steps
at either end leads to the surface.
There were changing rooms
alongside.
● The Granaries (Harappa)
six granaries in a row were found in
the citadel at Harappa.
● Houses were made up of burnt
bricks. They were often two or more
storeyed, with a square courtyard.
They had tiled bathrooms.
● Lamp-posts were erected at regular
intervals. It indicates the existence of
street lighting.
Agriculture
● It was the backbone of the
civilisation. The soil was fertile due to
inundation in the river Indus and
flooding.
● They used wooden ploughshare
(World’s first ploughed field at
Kalibangan) and stone sickles for
harvesting. Iron was not known to
them.
● Gabarbands or nalas enclosed by
dams for storing water were a feature
in parts of Baluchistan. Canal
irrigation was absent.
● Crops Produced wheat, barley, dates, peas,
sesamum, mustard, millet, ragi, bajra and
jowar. At Lothal and Rangpur, rice husks
were found. Sugarcane was not known to
Indus people.
● They were First to Produce Cotton in the
world, which Greek called as Sindon. A
fragment of woven cotton cloth was found at
Mohenjodaro.
Domestication of Animals
● They domesticated buffaloes, oxens, sheep,
asses, goats, pigs, elephants, dogs, cats etc.
● Remains of Horse were found at Surkotada
and of rhinoceros at Amri.
● Lion was not known to Indus people. Cow
was known to them but was not much
important.
Trade
● Agriculture, industry and forest produce
provided the basis for internal and external
trade.
● Trade was based on barter system. Coins
were not evident. Bullock carts and boats
were used for transportation.
● Weights and measures were made of
limestone, steatite etc. generally in cubical
shape. They were in multiple of sixteen.
Decimal system was known to them.
● Several sticks inscribed with measure marks
have been discovered. It indicates that
linear system of measurement was in use.
● Foreign trade flourished with Mesopotamia
or Sumeria (Iraq), Central Asia, Persia,
Afghanistan and Bahrain.
● Sumerian text refers to trade with Meluha
(Indus). Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan
(Makran coast) were two intermediate
stations.
● Susa and Ur were mesopotamian sites
where harappan seals were found.
● Lothal (artificial dockyard), Surkotada,
Sutkagendor, Allahoino, Balakot, Dholavira,
Daimabad were coastal towns of the
civilisation.

DECLINE OF THE CIVILISATION
The Harappan culture flourished till about 1900 BC, then it began to decline. There is no
unanimity among historians, regarding the exact reason for the decline of this urban
civilisation. There are many different theories that show the decline of the Indus culture.

Original Home and
Identity
● The word Aryan literally means of
high birth.
● The location of the original
homeland of the Aryans is still
controversial, but the most
accepted theory is that they
migrated from Central Asia in
several groups between
2000-1500 BC and settled in
Eastern Afghanistan, modern
Pakistan and Punjab.
● This region is popularly known as
the land of seven rivers or ‘Sapta
Sindhu’ (the Indus, its five
tributaries i.e. Jhelum, Chenab,
Ravi, Beas and Sutlej and the
Saraswati).
Note The Central Asian theory is also
proved by the Boghazkai Inscription
(Turkey), which mentions four Vedic
Gods : Indra, Varuna, Mitra and
Nasatya.
Rigvedic or Early Vedic Period
(1500-1000 BC)
● Early Vedic people lived in the region of Sapta
Sindhu. They had knowledge of about 40 rivers
including Yamuna, Saraswati and Ganga.
Ocean was mentioned as Samudra, Himalaya
as Himvant, Hindu Kush as Munjavants and
desert as Dhawa.

THE ARYAN AND THE VEDIC AGE
● Aryans came into conflict with the
indigenous inhabitants called Dasas
(earlier branch of Aryans) and Dasyus
(Original inhabitants). Dasyuhatya or
slaughter of Dasyus is repeatedly
mentioned in the Rig Veda.
The Dasarajna War
(Battle of Ten Kings)
■ This battle was fought on the bank of the
Parushni river (Ravi). Sudas, the son of
Divodas and the Bharata king of Tritsu family
won over an alliance of ten tribes
(Five Aryans and Five non-Aryans).
■ The battle broke out due to a dispute between
Vashistha (priest of Bharatas) and
Visvamitra (priest of alliance).
Economy
● Rigvedic Aryans followed a mixed
economy consisting of both agriculture
and pastoralism.
● Pastoralism was their primary
occupation while agriculture was
secondary.
● They possessed better knowledge in
agriculture. Wooden ploughshare is
mentioned in Rig Veda. They were
acquainted with sowing, harvesting,
threshing and knew about different
seasons.
● Cow was the most important form of
wealth. The term for war in the Rig Veda
is Gavishthi or search for cows. The
horse was almost as important as cow.
● Cow was the standard unit of exchange.
Gold coins like Nishka, Krishna and
Satmana were also in use. Godhuli was
used as a measure of time and Gavyuti as
measure of distance.
Polity
● The king or Rajan was the head of the
tribal polity. Although his post was
hereditary, we have also some traces of
election by the tribal assembly called
‘Samiti’.
● Several tribal or clan based assemblies
existed such as the Sabha, Samiti,
Vidatha and Gana.
● The Samiti was the National Assembly
of the people, while the Sabha was
Council of Elders.
● King was assisted by many functionaries.
Most important functionary was the
Purohita, the religious advisor of the
king, followed by the Senani, the head of
the army.
● There was no regular system of taxation.
People gave voluntary offerings to the
king, called Bali.
● There was no regular or standing army.
However, there were groups of infantry
and charioteers.
● Weapons made of stone, wood, bone and
metal were used.
Society
● Kinship was the basis of society’s
structure. People gave their primary
loyalty to the tribe, which was called
Jana or Vis.
● Vis was divided into grama. When
grama clashed with one another, it
caused the Sangrama or war.
● Society was mostly Patriarchal.
Monogamy was prevalent. No evidence
of child marriage was found. Levirate
and widow remarriage was practised.
● Varna was the term used for colour of
people, which were classified into four
Varnas.
● Brahmins (teachers and priests),
Kshatriyas (rulers and administrators),
Vaishyas (Peasants, merchants and
bankers), Sudras (artisans and
labourers).
Rigvedic Gods
● Rigvedic people believed in nature
worship and not in erecting temples or
idol worship. They performed Yajnas in
open areas.
● Soma was considered to be the God of
plants and an intoxicating drink is
named after him.
● The ninth mandala of the Rig Veda i.e.
‘Soma Mandala’ is attributed to Soma.
● Important female divinities were
Aditi and Usha.

Types of Marriages
Eight types of marriages were in
practice during the Vedic period :
Brahma Marriage of a duly dowered
girl to a man of the same
class.
Daiva A daughter is given to a
sacrificial priest, as a part of
his fee.
Arsa Giving the girl to a man in
exchange of bride-price.
Prajapatya The father gives the girl
without dowry and without
demanding the bride-price.
Gandharva Love marriage.
Asura Bride was bought from her
father.
Rakshasa Marriage by capture .
Paishacha Marriage by seduction.
Important Rituals
● Rajasuya—The king’s influence was
strengthened by rituals. The king performed
this sacrifice, which was supposed to confer
supreme power on him.
● Asvamedha—A king performed the
Asvamedha, which meant unquestioned
control over the area, in which the royal
horse ran uninterrupted.
● Vajapeya—A king performed the Vajapeya
or the chariot race, in which the royal
chariot was made to win the race against his
kinsmen.
LATER VEDIC AGE
(1000-600 BC)
(PAINTED GREYWARE
PHASE)
● Aryans expanded from Punjab to Western
UP covered by Ganga-Yamuna Doab
(Aryavarta).
● Later Vedic texts refer to rivers Narmada,
Sadanira, Chambal and Vindhya mountain.
Later Vedas gave three fold territorial
division of India into Aryavarta (Nothern
India), Madhyadesa (Central India) and
Dakshinapatha (Southern India).
● The expansion towards East is indicated in
a legend of Satapatha Brahmana i.e. how
Videha Madhava migrated from the
Saraswati region, crossed Sadanira and
came to the land of Videha (modern
Tirhut).
Polity
● Tribal assemblies lost their importance and
royal power increased at their cost. Vidhata
totally disappeared. Women were no longer
permitted to attend assemblies.
● Formation of large kingdoms, Kingship
became completely hereditary.
● The term Rashtra indicating territory, first
appeared in this period.
● Taittariya Brahmana refers to the theory of
divine origin of kingship.
● Satapatha Brahmana refers to
twelve Ratninas or civil functionaries of the
time.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 9
Twelve Ratninas (Shatapatha

Senani The General
Gramani Head of the village
Kshata Gateman/Chamberlain
Sangrahitri Treasurer
● There was development of judiciary.
Kings administered the criminal
court. Serious crimes were the killing
of an embryo, homicide, the murder
of a Brahmin, stealing of gold and
drinking sura. Treason was a capital
offence.
Society
● The fourfold division of society
became more clear. Initially based on
occupation, it later became
hereditary.
● Brahmin—The growing cult of
sacrifice enormously added to the
power of Brahmins.
● Kshatriyas They constituted the
warrior class.
● Vaisyas—They were the
agriculturalists, cattle rearers,
traders, artisans and metal workers.
● Shudras—Lowest in the social
hierarchy and born to serve the upper
three varna.
● The Ashram system was formed to
attain four purusharthas (Dharma,
Artha, Kama and Moksha). Jabala
Upanishada gives the earliest
reference to four ashramas i.e. the
stages of life—Brahmacharya,
Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sanyasa.
● Position of women declined. Aitareya
Brahmana states that daughter is the
source of misery while a son is the protector
of family. Maitrayani Samhita mentions
three evils—liquor, woman and dice.
Polygamy became frequent.
● However, some of the women had
got higher education as indicated by the
Yajnavalkya-Gargi dialogue in
Vrihadarnyaka Upanishada.
Economy
● Agriculture became the chief economic
activity. Manure was known. Wheat, rice,
barley, beans and Sesamum were cultivated.
● New occupational group emerged, such as
fisherman, washerman, dyers, doorkeepers and footmen.
● Tin, silver and iron was now known to the
people.
● Merchants were organised into Guilds, as
indicated by the terms-Ganas (corporations)
and Sresthins (aldermen).
● Characteristic pottery : Painted Grey
Ware.
Religion
● Rituals became important in the cult of
sacrifice.
● Prajapati became the supreme God. Vishnu
was conceived as the preserver and
protector of people.
● Pushan, responsible for well being of cattle,
became the God of Shudras.
● Towards the end of the Vedic age, a section
of society began to resent the priestly
domination.

first and strongest resistance from
Porus.
● Alexander defeated Porus in the
Battle of Hydaspas on the banks of
the river Vitasta (Jhelum), but was
impressed by his bravery, so he
restored to Porus, his kingdom and
made him his ally.
● After the Battle of Sakala, Alexander
proceeded upto Beas with a view to
conquer the East, but his fatigued
army refused to cross the river.
● So, he was forced to retreat. He
placed the North-Western India
under the Greek Governor Selucus
Nikator.
● He remained in India for 19 months
(326-325 BC) and died in Babylon

Western Asia.
● Indians learnt from the Greeks in the
fields of coinage, astronomy,
architecture and sculpture
(Gandhara school).
● Many Greek settlements were
established, like Alexandria in Kabul
and Sind, Boukephala in Jhelum.
● Alexander’s invasion paved the way
for the expansion of the Mauryan
empire in that area.
● His historians have left valuable
accounts related to Indian geography,
social and economic conditions,
which enable us to build the Indian
chronology of the times.
Pre-Mauryan Society
● Division of society into four classes
necessitated the formation of Dharmasutras.
● Shudras were ill-treated, while all privileges
were cornered by the Brahmanas and
Kshatriyas.

(321 BC-298 BC)
● Also called as Sandrocottus/ Androcottus
by Greek scholars.
● He entered into an alliance with Parvartaka
and with the help of Chanakya, he
dethroned the last Nanda ruler
Dhanananda and founded the Mauryan
dynasty with the capital at Pataliputra.
● Chandragupta defeated Selucus Nikator,
the general of Alexander in North-West
India in 305 BC. Selucus surrendered a vast
territory in return for 500 elephants.
Hindukush became the boundary between
the two states. There was a matrimonial
alliance between them.
● Selucus also sent the Greek Ambassador,
Megasthenese, to the court of
Chandragupta Maurya.
● Chandragupta embraced Jainism and went
to Chandragiri hill, at Sravanbelagola with
Bhadrabahu, where he died of slow
starvation (Salekhna).
● Chandragupta was the first Indian
ruler to unite the whole North India.
Both trade and agriculture flourished
during his reign. Weights and
measures were standarised, money
came into use and sanitation and
famine relief measures were
undertaken by the states.
Bindusara (298 BC-273 BC)
● Greeks called him Amitro Chates
(derived from Sanskrit word
Amitraghata i.e. slayer of foes);
Vindupala (Chinese texts;),
Sinhasena- Jain text; Bhadrasara
(Vayu Purana).
● He extended the kingdom further to
the Peninsular region of India as far
South as Mysore.
● Antiochus I, the Selucid king of Syria,
sent his Ambassador, Deimachus to
his court.

Philladelphus of Egypt sent
Dionysius as his Ambassador to the
court of Bindusara.

● A Buddhist text Dipavasma says that
he usurped the throne after killing his
99 brothers, except the youngest one,
Tissa in the war of succession that
lasted for four years.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 23
● He fought Kalinga War (261 BC) in
the 9th year of his rule. The miseries of
war caused deep remorse to Ashoka,
and therefore he abandoned the policy
of physical conquest (Bherighosa) in
favour of cultural conquest
(Dhamma ghosha).

conquest. This proves that he was not
an extreme pacifist and changes in his
policies were mainly for administrative
purposes.

Upagupta.
● He sent his son Mahendra and
daughter Sanghamitra to Ceylon as

India and by native rulers (Shungas,
Kanvas, Satvahanas) in the Eastern,
central and Deccan region of India.
FOREIGN STATES
The Indo-Greeks
● A series of invasions began in about
200 BC. The weak Mauryan king failed
to restrict them. The first to invade
India were the Indo Greeks, who ruled
Bactria lying South of the Oxus river in
the area covered by North Afghanistan.
They occupied a large portion of
North-Western India and moved upto
Ayodhya and Pataliputra.

Menander (165-145 BC) or Milinda.
He had his capital at Sakala (modern
Sialkot in Punjab). He invaded the
Ganga Yamuna doab. He was converted
to Buddhism by Nagasena. Menander
and Nagasena’s conversation were

from Afghanistan, Punjab, Mathura,
(where it ruled for about two centuries.),
Ujjain (rules over) Western India and
Deccan.
● A king of Ujjain, who called himself
Vikramaditya defeated Shakas. An era
called the Vikram Samvat is recorded
from the event of his victory over the
Shakas i.e. 57 BC.
● The most famous Shaka ruler in India
was Rudradaman (AD 130-150).
● He repaired the Sudarshan lake in the
semi arid zone of Kathiawar and issued
the first ever longest inscription in Chaste
Sanskrit at Junagarh.

This shows that successors of Kanishka
bore typical Indian names as Vasudeva.
Impacts of Central
Asian Contact

Kanishka shows artistic creations of
Mathura School. Vatsyayana wrote
Kamasutra in this period.
Gandhara School of Art
● It exhibits the influence of Greek and
Roman art; patronised by Shakas and

28 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
THE AGE OF THE GUPTAS
● Virasen was his Commander- in-Chief during Southern campaign. Vasubandhu, a
famous Buddhist scholar, was his minister. Samudragupta’s arms reached as far as
Kanchi, Tamil Nadu, where the Pallavas were compelled to recognise his suzerainty.
● Samudragupta annexed the territories after defeating the monarchs in North India,
but did not annex territories in South India. His authority over Java, Sumatra and
Malaya island proves that he maintained a strong navy.
● Samudragupta is said to have composed numerous poems of high merit. Some of his
coins represent him playing the Veena. He also performed Ashvamedha sacrifices.
● The Allahabad pillar inscriptions mention the title Dharma Prachar Bandhu i.e. he

● Mehrauli Iron Pillar Inscription (Delhi) claims his authority over North-Western
India and a good portion of Bengal. It says that the king defeated the confederacy of
Vangas and Vahilkas (Bulkh). Virasena’s Udaygiri cave inscription refers to his
conquest of the whole world.
● Chandragupta II conquered Western Malwa and Gujarat, from the Shaka Kshatrapas
Rudra Simha III. The conquest gave Chandragupta the Western sea coast, famous for
trade and commerce. This contributed to the prosperity of Malwa and its Chief city
Ujjain. Ujjain was made the second capital by Chandragupta II.

Vikramaditya (also mentioned in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription).
● During his period Sudarshana lake was repaired and its embankments were rebuilt.
● The continuous attack of the Hunas weakened the economy and the decline of empire
began soon after the death of Skandagupta.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 29
Gupta Administration
● Gupta administration was highly
decentralised and quasi-feudal in
character.
● Gupta Kings adopted pompous titles
such as Parameshvara,
Maharajadhiraj, Parambhattarka,
which signify that they ruled over the
lesser kings in their empire. The
practice of appointing Kumara (crown
prince) came in vogue.
● Kings were assisted by Mantriparishad/

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
Md Bin Qasim Invasion (AD 712) Md
Qasim of Iraq was the first Muslim to
invade India. He defeated the ruler of
Sind, Dahir and the province was given to
Omayyad Khilafat.
TURKISH INVASIONS
Mahmud of Ghazni
● Towards the close of the AD ninth
century, the vast empire of Arab broke
up and the Turks who got the
upperhand over the Khalifas of
Baghdad, established many
independant principalities. One of such
Turk state was founded by Alapigin
with Ghazni as his capital in about
AD 933.
● In those days, Punjab and the
North-West of India were ruled by
Jaipal of the Shahiya dynasty
(Hindustani). Subuktigin, the ruler of
Ghazni of that period, fought with
Jaipal and defeated him.
● Mahmud Ghaznavi was the eldest son
of Subuktigin, born in AD 971 and
ascended the throne in AD 998.
● For India, the only memory of Mahmud
is that of a plunderer and destroyer of
temples. Mahmud is said to have made
17 raids into India. The initial raids
were directed against the Hindustani
rulers. In AD 1001, the Hindustani
ruler Jaipal again was defeated by
Mahmud.
● His son Anandapala succeeded the
throne. A decisive battle between
Mahmud and Anandapala was fought in
AD 1008-09 at Waihind during his
sixth expedition.
● In other expeditions Mahmud
plundered Nagarkot, Thaneshwar,
Kannauj, Mathura and Somnath.
● He plundered Somnath temple in AD
1025 (his sixteenth raid).
● In AD 1026, Mahmud defeated the Jats.
He died in AD 1030. The objective of
Mahmud’s expeditions was to plunder
and loot. He was not interested in
expanding his empire to India.
MUHAMMAD GHORI
● The Ghaznavi state was no longer a
powerful state after Mahmud Ghazni. His
successors were weak which resulted into
the emergence of a Seljuk empire. But
towards the middle of the 12th century,
another group of Turkish tribe man
shattered the power of the Seljuk Turks.
● The power of the Ghurids increased
under Sultan Alauddin, who earned the
title the World burner, because he
ravaged Ghazni and burnt it into the
ground.
● In 1173, Muizzudin Muhammad
(Muhammad Ghori) ascended the throne
at Ghazni, while his elder brother was
ruling at Ghur. Muizzudin Muhammad
conquered Multan and Kutch.
● In 1178, he attempted to penetrate into
Gujarat by marching across the
Rajputana desert, but was completely
rooted out by the Gujarat ruler.
● He realised the necessity of creating a
suitable base in Punjab before venturing
upon the conquest of India. He
conquered Peshawar, Lahore and
Sialkot.
● At that period, the Chauhan power had
been steadily growing. Chauhans had
captured Delhi from the Tomars around
the middle of the century.
● At the age of 11, Prithviraj ascended the
throne at Ajmer and began a career of
conquest. He invaded the Chandellas of
Bundelkhand in a battle near Mahoba.
42
Quick Digest
■ Mahmud is considered as a hero of Islam by
medieval Muslim historians because of his
stout defence against the Central Asian Turkish
tribal invaders.
■ Secondly, because he was closely associated
with the renaissance of the Iranian spirit.
■ A high water mark in the Iranian renaissance
was reached with Firdausi’s Shah Namah.
■ He patronised three persons, contemporary to
him: Firdausi (court poet), Alberuni (scholar)
and Utbi (court historian).
■ Alberuni wrote ‘Kitab-ul-Hind’.
ARAB CONQUEST OF SIND
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● Both Prithviraj and Muhammad Ghori’s
attention towards the Punjab and Ganga
valley brought the two ambitious rulers
into conflict. In the First Battle of
Terrain (1191) the Ghori forces were
completely rooted out by Prithviraj.
● It is said that Jaichand, the ruler of
Kannauj (Gahadavala kingdom) did not
help Prithviraj during the Second battle
of Terrain because Prithviraj had
abducted, Jaichand’s daughter
Sanyogita, who was in love with him.
● Prithviraj Raso, written by court poet
of Prithviraj, Chand Bardai, the depicts
the life story of Prithviraj and his love
story.
● The defeat laid the foundation of
Muslim rule in India.
● Later on in 1194, Jaichand of Kannauj
was also defeated at the Battle of
Chandawar.
● Bakhtiyar Khilji one of Ghori’s
commanders, annexed Bihar and
Bengal and destroyed Nalanda and
Vikramshila Universities.
● Muhammad Ghori died in AD 1206,
leaving the charge with Qutub-ud-din
Aibak.
● The Sultanate of Delhi had five ruling
dynasties with 34 kings.
Battle of Terrain
■ The Second Battle of Terrain (1192) is regarded
as one of the turning point in Indian history.
The better organised and well prepared
Turkish force defeated the Indian forces.
■ Prithviraj was defeated by Muhammad Ghori.
Prithviraj was allowed to rule over Ajmer for
sometime. But was executed on a charge of
conspiracy after some time.
Causes of the Turkish Success
● Political disunity among Rajput and
internal rivalries.
● No Central Government.
● Unguarded frontiers, even after repeated
attacks.
● Organised military and ambitious Turkish
invaders.
43
THE ILBARI OR SLAVE
DYNASTY (1206-1290)
● After Muhammad Ghori’s death, all the
Muslim rulers who ruled over India from
AD 1206-1290 were either slaves or were
descendants of the slave ruler. So, the
Dynasty is generally known as the Slave
Dynasty.
● The dynasty is also called Ilbari Dynasty,
as all the rulers of this dynasty except
Aibak belonged to the Ilbari tribe of
Turks.
Qutubuddin Aibak
(1206-1210)
● Originally a slave, Qutubuddin, because
of his merit and loyal service was rose to
the post of Viceroy by Muhammad Ghori.

● For his generosity, he was given the title
of Lakh Baksh.
● He constructed two mosques
Quwwat-ul-Islam at Delhi and Adhai
Din ka Jhopra at Ajmer.
● He also began the construction of Qutub
Minar in the honour of famous Sufi

patronised writers like Hasan-ulNizami, author of Taj-ul-Massir and
Fakhruddin, author of Tarikh-iMubarak-Shahi. He fell from the horse
while playing chaugan (Polo) and died.
THE DELHI SULTANATE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
Aram Shah (AD 1210)

Shah succeeded him. Aram Shah proved
quite incompetent. Some of the nobles
rose to the occassion and invited Aibak’s
son-in-law and Governor of Badaun,
Iltutmish to ascend the throne. He
deposed Aram Shah and secured the
throne for himself.
Iltutmish (AD 1211-1236)
● He is considered to be the greatest slave
king and the real consolidator of the
Turkish conquest in India.
● He made Delhi the capital in place of

ruler of Ghazni. He sent expeditions
against the Rajputs in Ranthambor,
Jalor, Gwalior, Ajmer and Malwa.
● During his period, the Mongols under
their leader Changez Khan made their

the expenses of the government, he
sent the surplus amount to the Central
Government.
● He introduced the Silver Tanka and
Copper Jital.
● He patronised Minhaj-us-Siraj, author of
Tabaqat-i-Nasiri.
● He is called the father of Tomb Building
(built Sultan Garhi in Delhi).
Rukunuddin Firoz (AD 1236)
● Iltutmish appointed his daughter Raziya
as his successor.
● But most of the nobles could not reconcile
themselves to the idea of a woman ruling
over them and so they placed one of his
son Rukunuddin Firoz on the throne. He
was a worthless person who left the work
of the government in the hand of his
mother, Shah Turkan.
● Finally throne was given to Raziya when
he was out of the capital to curb a
rebellion in Awadh against him.
Raziya Sultan (AD 1236-1240)
● She was the first and the last Muslim
woman ruler of Medieval India.
● Raziya successfully crushed the rebellions
that occurred in Multan Lahore and
Jhansi. The wazir Nizam-ul-Mulk
Junaidi, who had opposed her elevation
to the throne, was defeated by Raziya.
● She also sent an expedition against
Ranthambhor to control the Rajput.
● She discarded the female apparel and
started holding the court with her face
unveiled.
● Her attempt to create a party of nobles
loyal to her and the appointment of a
non-Turk, Yakut to the high office led to
opposition.
● She herself led an expedition against the
rebellious Governor of Lahore and forced
him to acknowledge her suzerainty.
● There was again a serious rebellion in
Bhatinda. Altunia, Governor of Bhatinda
refused to accept the suzerainty of Razia.
Razia, accompanied by Yakut, marched
against Altunia.
● However, Altunia murdered Yakut and
imprisoned Razia. Subsequently, Razia
married Altunia and both of them
marched towards Delhi. In AD 1240,
Razia, became the victim of a the
conspiracy and was assassinated near
Kaithal (Haryana) by the jats.
● After Raziya, the battle of succession
continued in which the some rulers ruled
insignificantly.

raised pavillion. Ibn Battuta, the
Moroccan traveller, who was in Delhi at

to sabotage arranged by his son, Jauna
Khan (Muhammad-bin- Tughlaq).
MUHAMMAD-BINTUGHLAQ (AD 1325-1351)
● Jauna Khan ascended the throne under

who ever sat on the throne of Delhi. He
was an expert in Arabic, Persian
Astronomy, Philosophy, Maths and
Medicine.
● He applied his rational and innovative
mind in every aspect of administration
but achieved little success as he was
very hasty in nature.
Five Ambitious Projects of
Muhammad-Bin-Tughlaq
His five ambitious projects were
Taxation in the Doab (1326)
The Sultan made an ill-advised financial
experiment in the Doab between the
Gangas and the Yamuna. He not only
increased the rate of taxation, but also
revived and created, some additional
Abwabs or Cessess.
Transfer of the Capital (1327)
The most controversial step was the
transfer of capital from Delhi to Deogiri.
He renamed Deogiri as Daulatabad.
Introduction of Token Currency
(1329)
Muhammad Tughlaq decided to introduce
Bronze coin, instead of the silver coin
which would have the same value.
The Khurasan Expedition
(1329)
Under the vision of Universal Conquest, he
decided to conquest Khurasan and Iraq and
mobilised a huge army for this purpose.
Qarachil Expedition (1330)
This expedition was launched, in Kumaon
hills in the Himalayas, allegedly to counter
Chinese incursions. The attack was
successful, but when the rainy season set in,
the invaders suffered terribly. He died in
Thatta (Sind), while campaigning against a
Turkish slave Taghi.
Diwan-i-Kohi
A new department of agriculture Diwan-i-Kohi
was set-up. He built the fortress of Adilabad and
the city of “Jahanpanah”.
Ibn-Battuta
The famous Moroccan traveller Ibn-Battuta
came to Delhi in 1334 and acted as the Qazi of
the capital for 8 years. He recorded the
contemporary Indian scene in his Safranamah
(Rehla).
Firoz Shah Tughlaq(1351-1388)
● Firoz Tughlaq faced the problem of
preventing the imminent break up of
Delhi Sultanate. So he tried to appease
the nobility, the army and the Battuta
theologians.
● He made the Iqta system hereditary.
● He extended the principle of heredity to
the army. The soldiers were not paid by
cash but by assignments on land revenue
of villages (Vajeha). This technique led to
many abuses.
● In order to encourage agriculture, the
Sultan paid a lot of attention to irrigation.
He repaired a number of canals. The first
canal was from Sutlej to Ghaggar. The
second canal carried water from Yamuna
to Hissar. He imposed Haq-i-Sharb or
Hasil-i- Sharb i.e. water tax.
● He encouraged the practice of slavery
and selected young boys from the
conquered territory for the purpose.
Diwan-i-Bandagon was created as the
department for slaves.
47
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History

Jital) and Bikh (25% Jital).
● Mathura was destroyed during his period.
● He made Jaziya a separate tax and he
imposed this tax upon the Brahmans
for the first time in the history of
Sultanate.
● Barani, the historian, was in his
court. He wrote Tarikh-i-Firozshahi
and Fatwa-i-Jahangiri.
● He died in AD 1388.
THE LATER

Ala-ud-din Sikandar Shah for a brief
period in 1394, but regained the
throne after Sikandar’s death.
He ruled till AD 1412. During his
period, Timur invaded India.
Timur’s Invasion
● Timur, the head of the Chaghtai Turks
and the ruler of Mongols in (Central
Asia) invaded India in 1398, during the

inflicted on India more misery, than had
ever before been done by a conquerer in a
single invasion.
● Timur nominated Khizr Khan to rule over
Punjab and himself returned to Central
Asia. He died on his way to conquer China
in AD 1404.

Firoz Shah Tughlaq introduced new system of
taxation according to the Quran.
■ Kharaj A land tax of 1/10th of the
procedure of land.
■ Zakat 2.5% tax on property (by Muslim
only).
■ Jaziya A tax by non-Muslims (even by
Brahmins).
■ Khams 1/6th of the booty captured during
war.
THE SAYYID DYNASTY
(AD 1414-51)
● Khizr Khan (1414-21) founded the Sayyid
dynasty and claimed to have descended
from the prophet of Islam.
● He helped Timur in his invasion, so was
given the governship of Lahore.

incapable rulers.
● Mubarak Shah (1421-34) led successful
expeditions against Mewatis, Katehars and
the Gangeti Doab area. He was killed and

very small area, rest being governed by
nobles. Alauddin Shah Alam (1443-1451)
was the last Sayyid king who retired as a
coward, descending in favour of Bahlol
Lodhi. Thus, the Sayyid Dynasty was
replaced by the Lodhi Dynasty.
● Yahya-bin-Ahmed-bin-Abdullah Sirhindi
wrote Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi (History of
Muhammad Shah of Sayyid Dynasty).

The Sufi Movement
Mystics who are called Sufis, rose in Islam at a very early stage.
● These saints had nothing to do with the state. They laid great emphasis on love as a
bond between God and the individual soul.
● Sufi came out of the word sooph meaning wool. They advocated life of purity and
renunciation. Sufism sprang from the doctrine of Wahadat-ul-Wujud or unity of being.
This doctrine was propounded by Ibn-ul-Arabi.
● One and the earliest Sufis was Rabia, a woman.
● Sufis organised 12 orders or silsilas. A silsila was generally led by a prominent mystic,
who lived in a khanqah or hospice alongwith his disciple. The link between the teacher
or pir and his disciples or murids was a vital part of Sufism. Every pir nominated a
successor or wali to carry out his work.
● Sufi orders are broadly divided into Ba-shara that is those which followed the Islamic
law (shariat) and Be-shara, that is those which were not bound by it.

pre-occupations with the affairs of
Deccan.

ablest general led the expedition against
Ahoms.
Religious Policy of Aurangzeb
Aurangzeb was a Sunni orthodox Muslim, who
wanted to convert India from Dar-ul-Harb to
Dar-ul-Islam. His religious policy was a
departure from the policy of tolerance and
universal peace followed by Akbar. He replaced
the solar calender by the lunar Hira, dismissed
court musicians and royal painters, appointed
Muhtasibts (court sensors) from amongst the
Ulema, to enforce sharia’t.

Shivaji (1674-80)
● Shivaji belonged to the Bhonsle Clan of
Marathas. Shivaji’s father Shahji
Bhonsle was a military commander
under Nizam Shahi ruler of
Ahmednagar.
● Shivaji was born to Jijabai in the hill
fortress of Shivner. Shivaji’s early career
and life was influenced by Jijabai, his
mother, Dadaji Kondadev, the manager
of his father’s Jagir and Guru Ramdas,
his spiritual teacher.
● Dadaji Kondadev gave him training in
civil and military administration.
● Before that, in 1646, he conquered the
fort of Torna and built forts at Raigarh
and Pratapgarh. In 1647, he assumed
full charge of his Jagir.
● In 1659, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan,
Ambassador of Ali Adil Shah (Sultan of
Bijapur), in a meeting with his tiger
paws. The Sultan then acknowledged the
independent status of Shivaji.
● Later, Shaista Khan, a Governor of
Deccan, was deputed by Aurangzeb to
put down the rising power of Shivaji in
1660. Shivaji lost Poona and suffered
several defeats, till he made a bold attack
on Shaista’s military camp at night and
plundered Surat and later Ahmednagar.
● Raja Jai Singh of Amber was then
appointed by Aurangzeb to put down
Shivaji (1665) and Jai Singh succeeded
in besieging Shivaji in the fort of
Purandhar. Consequently, the Treaty of
Purandhar (1665) was signed according

Mughals and paid a visit to the Mughal
court at Agra. Shivaji also agreed to help
Mughals in their attack on Bijapur.

assumed the title of Haindava
Dharmodharak (protector of Hinduism)
and Chhatrapati. He became the sovereign
ruler of Maharashtra. He died in 1680.
Shivaji’s Administration
● Shivaji divided the territories under his rule
into three provinces (prants), each under a
Viceroy. Provinces were divided into Prants,
which were subdivided into Parganas or
Tarafs. The lowest unit was village, headed
by a headman or patel.
● Shivaji was helped by Ashtapradhan (eight
ministers), which was unlike a Council of
Ministers, for there was no collective
responsibility. Each minister was directly
responsible to Shivaji.
● His administrative reforms were guided by
Malik Amber of Ahmednagar.
Shivaji’s Revenue
Administration
● Assessment of land revenue was based on
measurement. The Kathi of Amber was
adopted as the unit of measurement.
● Chauth was one-fourth of the land revenue
paid to the Marathas so as not to be
subjected to Maratha’s raid.
● Sardeshmukhi was an additional levy of 10
per cent (1/10th) on those lands of
Maharashtra, over which the Marathas
claimed hereditary right, but which formed
part of the Mughal empire.
MARATHAS AFTER
SHIVAJI
● There was a dispute of succession
between Sambhaji and Rajaram.
● Son of Shivaji, Sambhaji (1680-89)
succeeded the throne. He was an
incapable ruler and poor diplomat.
● Prince Akbar, the rebellious son of
Aurangzeb took shelter with him.
Sambhaji was executed by Aurangzeb
and his infant son, Shahu, was taken
captive by Aurangzeb. Sambhaji was
succeeded by Rajaram in 1689.
● Rajaram (1689-1700) was killed in
1700 by Aurangzeb. His widow
Tarabai put her infant son, Shivaji II,
on the throne. Rajaram created the
new Ministerial post of Pratinidhi.
Thus, total number of ministers
became nine.
● After Aurangzeb’s death in 1707,
Shahu, the grandson of Shivaji and
son of Sambhaji was released by
Bahadur Shah. He claimed the
throne and this led to a civil war
between Shahu and Tarabai. Shahu
emerged victorious in the Battle of
Khed, with the help of Balaji
Vishwanath. After this, Shahu ruled
from Satara and Tarabai from
Kolhapur. From now onwards, the
rule of Peshwa started. They became
virtual rulers of the state.

ECONOMIC AND
COMMERCIAL
POLICY
The ‘gradual development of Economic
and Commerical Policy has been traced
through three stages of British
colonialism by RP Dutta.
Phases of Economic Policy
Early Phase (1600-1757)
The East India Company was purely a
trading company, dealing with import of
goods and precious metals into India and
export of spices and textiles.
Mercantile Phase (1757-1813)
They imposed their own prices and had
no relation with the cost of production.
The Company used its political power and
monopolised trade and dictated terms to
the weavers of Bengal. The Company
used revenue of Bengal to finance exports
of Indian goods.
Industrial Phase (1813-1858)
The British mercantile industrial
capitalist class exploited India. Charter
Act of 1813, allowed ‘one way free trade’
for British citizens resulting in Indian
markets flooded with cheap and machine
made imported goods from Britain.
Indians not only lost their foreign markets
but their Indian markets also.
Finance Imperialism
(1858 Onwards)
This phase saw export of capital from
India and also chains of British controlled
banks, export import firms and managing
agency houses. Exploitation through
railways is the best example of finance
Imperialism.
Drain of Wealth Theory
● ‘‘Drain of Wealth’’ refers to a portion of
National Product of India, which was not
available for consumption of its own
people.
● Dadabhai Naoroji first cited the drain of
wealth theory in his book titled Poverty
and Un-British Rule in India.
● RC Dutt blamed the British policy for
Indian economic ills in his book Economic
History of India.
● Drain of wealth began in 1757 after Battle
of Plassey. In 1765, the company acquired
the diwani of Bengal and began the
purchase of Indian goods out of the
revenue of Bengal and exported them.
These purchases were known as
Company’s investments.
LAND REVENUE
SYSTEMS
Permanent Settlement
● Introduced in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa,
districts of Banaras and Northern
districts of Madras by Lord Cornwallis in
1793.
● John Shore planned this settlement.
● Assured of their ownership, many
zamindars stayed in towns and exploited
their tenants.
● It declared zamindars as the owners of the
land. Hence, they could keep 1/11th of the
revenue collected to themselves while the
British got a fixed share of 10/11th of the
revenue collected. The zamindars were
free to fix the rate.
Ryotwari Settlement
● Introduced in Bombay, Madras and
Assam. Munro and Charles Reed
recommended it.
● In this, the direct settlement was made
between the Government and the Ryots.
● The revenue was based on the basis of the
quality of the soil and the nature of the
crop. The revenue was fixed for a period
not exceeding 30 years. It was based on
the ‘Scientific Rent Theory of Ricardo.’
● The position of the cultivator became
more secure.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
Mahalwari System
● Introduced in the area of Ganga
valley, North-West Frontier Provinces
parts of Central India and Punjab.
● Revenue Settlement was to be made
by village or estates with landlords.
A settlement was made with the village,
which maintained a form of common
ownership known as Bhaichara or with
Mahals, which were group of villages.
Revenue was periodically revised.
CAUSES OF THE
REVOLT
● Political Nana Sahib was refused
pension as he was the adopted son of
Peshwa Baji Rao-II to lead the revolt at
Kanpur.
● Awadh (Lucknow) was annexed
in 1856, on charge of
maladministration and Jhansi was
annexed owing to the Doctrine of
Lapse.
Military Discrimination
Indian soldiers were paid low salaries,
they could not rise above the rank of
Subedar and were racially insulted.
Religious Discrimination
The social reforms by British was against
the people’s will (widow remarriage,
abolition of sati, school for girls,
Christian missionaries etc). Soldiers
were asked to use the Enfield Rifles with
greased (by pork or beef) cartridges.
Economic Grievances
Heavy taxations, discriminatory tariff
policy; destruction of traditional
handicrafts that hit peasants, artisans
and small zamindars.
Outbreak of the Revolt
● Bengal Resentment in which 19
native infantries of Behrampur,
refused to use the newly introduced
Enfield Rifle.
● Mangal Pandey 34th native infantry
fired at the sergeant major of his
regiment. Known as a part of Mutiny of
Barrackpur.
● Mangal Pandey was hanged.
● On 10th May, 1857, the sepoys at Meerut
refused to use Enfiled Rifles and revolted.
The mutiny spread throughout Uttar
Pradesh and sepoys moved to Delhi crying
March to Delhi.
● At Delhi, Bahadur Shah II was
declared ‘Shahenshah-i-Hindustan.’
● Where the rulers were loyal to the British,
the soldiers revolted as in Gwalior and
Indore. In some places, people revolted
before the sepoys.
● In the beginning, the rebels were
successful. Europeans were killed, police
stations and law courts were attacked and
revenue records were destroyed. But, the
revolt was soon suppressed.
Centres of Revolt and
their Leaders
■ Delhi Bahadur Shah II, General Bakht Khan
■ Kanpur Nana Sahib/Dhondhu Pant (adopted
son of Baji Rao-II) Tantia Tope, Azimullah khan
■ Jhansi Rani Lakshmi Bai
■ Lucknow Begum Hazrat Mahal, her son Birjis
Qadir.
■ Faizabad Maulavi Ahamdullah
■ Bareilley Khan Bahadur Khan
■ Bihar (Arrah) Kunwar Singh, Zamindar of
Jagdishpur.
Suppression of the Revolt
● John Lawrence remarked, ‘‘Had a single
leader of ability arisen among them we
must have been lost beyond redemption.’’
Delhi was captured on 20th September,
1857 by John Nicholson and Bahadur
Shah II was deported to Rangoon, where
he died in 1862. His sons were shot dead at
Delhi.
76
REVOLT OF 1857
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 77
● Jhansi was captured by Hugh Rose on 17th
June, 1858. Rani Lakshmi Bai died in the
battle field.

21st March, 1858 by Colin Campbell,
Havelock and Outram.

by a friend. He was captured and executed
on 15th April, 1859.
Rani Lakshmi Bai
Rani Lakshmi Bai, nicknamed Manu, was married
to Raja Gangadhar Rao in 1842. The couple
adopted a child in 1853 but Lord Dalhousie
wished to annex Jhansi under the Doctrine of
Lapse. Rani did not surrender and died fighting at
Kalpi near Jhansi during the Revolt of 1857.
Causes Behind the Failure of
the Revolt
● Lack of unity and poor organisation of the
revolt. All the classes of the society were
not effected or participated in the revolt.
● Lack of common motive for participating
in the revolt. Some of the rulers like
Scindhias, Nizam and Holkars helped
Britishers in reppressing the revolt.
● The military equipments of rebels were
inferior.
● The most significant feature of the
revolt was the exhibition of
Hindu–Muslim Unity.
● Concentrated on the Northern part of
India.
Impacts of the Revolt
● In August 1858, the British Parliament
passed an Act, which put an end to the
rule of the Company. The
responsibility of the administration of
British India passed into the hands of
the British Queen and the Parliament.
● An office of the Secretary of State for
India with a 15 members’ council was
constituted for the administration of
India.
● The designation of the GovernorGeneral was changed to Viceroy, who
was to act as a representative.
● ‘Doctrine of Lapse’ was withdrawn.
Princely states were assured against
annexation.
● The British pursued the divide and
rule policy.
● Increase in the number of white
soldiers in the army.
● Total expense of the suppression was
borne by the Indians.
Opinions on the Nature of the 1857 Revolt

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 83
First Phase (1758-1812)
● Initially, the East India Company was not
interested in the development of
education. Some minor exceptions were
efforts by individuals.
● The Calcutta Madrasa established by
Warren Hastings in 1781, for the study of
Muslim law.
● The Sanskrit College established by
Jonathan Duncan at Banaras in 1791, for
the study of Hindu law and philosophy.
● Fort William College established by
Wellesley in AD 1800, for training of Civil
Servants of the Company in Indian
languages and customs (closed in AD
1802).
Second Phase (1813-1853)
● For the first time, the British Parliament
included in 1813 Charter, a clause under
which the Governor-General-in-Council
was bound to keep a sum not less than one
lakh rupees, for education. However, the
company used this fund for promoting
Indian language and literature.
● The charter allowed the Christian
missionaries to spread their religious ideas
in India.
● The greatest importance of the 1813 Act
was that the Company, for the first time,
acknowledged state responsibility for
promotion of education in India.
● Establishment of Calcutta College in 1817
with the efforts of Raja Ram Mohan Roy
for imparting Western education. Three
Sanskrit colleges were set-up at Calcutta.
● In 1823, a General Committee of Public
Instruction was appointed to look after the
development of education in India, but
failed due to Orientalist-Anglicist
controversy over the nature of education
i.e. traditional or Western and the medium
of instruction.
● The controversy was settled by
Macaulay’s Education Policy 1835,
which was approved by Lord William
Bentinck. The policy favoured English
education to a traditional one.
● In 1844, Lord Hardinge decided to give
government employment to Indians
educated in English schools. This
further boosted the Western education
in India.
● Bethune school was founded by JED
Bethune at Calcutta (1849),
Agricultural Institute at Pusa
(Bihar) and Engineering Institute at
Roorkee.
Third Phase (1854-1900)
● In 1854, Charles Wood prepared a
despatch on an Educational System
for India, which came to be called the
Magna Carta of Education in the
country. According to Wood’s scheme
(i) The government needed to spread
Western education through English
medium for higher education. But
Vernacular primary schools should
be set-up in rural areas.
(ii) A grants-in-aid system to
encourage private enterprises
involvement in education.
(iii) A department of public instruction
to be set-up in each of the five
provinces.
(iv) Universities in Calcutta (1857),
Bombay (1857) and Madras (1857)
were established.
(v) Teacher’s training institutions.
(vi) Promotion of Education for
Women.
● Most of Wood's proposals were
implemented, which led to
Westernisation of the Indian
Educational System.

Objectives and Methods
of Work
Moderate Phase, (1885-1905)
● Development and consolidation of
feeling of national unity irrespective of
race, caste, religion or province.
● Peaceful constitutional agitations,
prayer and petitions were the
instruments of work.
● They succeeded in passing the Indian
Councils Act of 1892, which allowed
some members to be indirectly elected
by Indians, but keeping the official
majority intact.
Moderate Leaders

● They worked to create a strong public
opinion to arouse consciousness and
national spirit. They persuaded the
British Government and British public
opinion to introduce reforms in India.
Extremist Phase (1905-17)
Cause for the Rise of Extremists
● Dissatisfaction with the methods and
achievements of moderates.
● Growing consciousness about the
exploitative character of the British
rule. Loss of Britain in the Boer wars
(1899-1902) demolished the myth of
whiteman supremacy.
● Reactionary policies of CurzonUniversity Act (1904), Indian Official
Secrets Act (1904) to restrict freedom
of press and partition of Bengal.
● Extremists gave the idea of India’s
independence the central place in
India’s politics.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History 89
THE INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT
Methods of the Extremists
● Promotion of Swadeshi and Boycott of
foreign goods. Non-Co-operation with
Britishers (Passive Resistance).
Extremist leaders- Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal
Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Sir
Aurobindo Ghosh, Chakravarti Bose,
T Prakasham and Chidambaram Pillai.
● They want to take the movement outside
Bengal.
Partition of Bengal
● Through a royal proclamation, Lord
Curzon ordered Partition of Bengal
creating East Bengal and Assam out of rest
of Bengal on 16th October, 1905.
● The objective was to set up a communal
gulf between the Hindus and Muslims.
● The Indian National Movement entered its
second phase after the Partition of Bengal.
● The British said that the existing province
of Bengal was too big to be efficiently
administered by a single Provincial
Government.
● The Indian National Congress and the
nationalists of Bengal firmly opposed the
Partition. Within Bengal, different sections
of population— zamindars, merchants,
lawyers, students and even women rose up
in spontaneous opposition to the partition of
their province.
● Divide and Rule The nationalists could
see that it was a deliberate attempt to
divide the Bengal’s territory on religious
grounds as for Eastern part Muslims will
be in majority and for the Western part,
the Hindus.
● Rabindranath Tagore composed the
National Song Amar Sonar Bangla for the
occasion. This song was adopted as
National Anthem by Bangladesh in 1971,
after its liberation from Pakistan.
The Anti-Partition Movement
● The Anti-Partition movement was initiated
on 7th August, 1905. On that day, a
massive demonstration against the
partition, was organised in the Town Hall
in Calcutta.

1905.
■ Banaras Session of INC, 1905-
Presided by GK Gokhale–first call for
Swadeshi.
■ Meeting of INC at Calcutta 7th
August 1905–Resolution to boycott British
goods was adopted.
The Swadeshi and Boycott
(1905-1908)
● It had its origin in the Anti-Partition
movement of Bengal. Mass meetings
were held all over Bengal, where
Swadeshi or the use of Indian goods
and the boycott of British goods were
proclaimed and pledged. Public
burning of foreign cloth were organised
and shops selling foreign cloths were
picketed.
● An important aspect of the Swadeshi
Movement was the emphasis placed on
self reliance or Atmashakti.
● Acharya PC Roy organised his famous
Bengal Chemical Swadeshi stores.
● The Swadeshi Movement had several
consequences like flowering of
nationalist poetry, journalism,
self-reliant and opening many national
educational institutions.
● Nationalist Educational Institutions
were founded e.g., Bengal Technical
Institute, Bengal National College.
● BC Pal and Chidambram Pillai led
Vandemataram Movement in Madras.
● Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh led the
movement in Punjab. Syed Haider
Raza led the movement in Delhi.
Why Swadeshi Movement
Failed?
● Severe government repression.
● Split in nationalists at Surat.
● Lack of effective organisation.
● The movement was rendered
leaderless.
Formation of Muslim League
● Set-up in1906, under the leadership of
Aga Khan, Nawab Salimullah of Dhaka
and Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk.
● League supported Partition of Bengal,
opposed the Swadeshi Movement,

community and separate electorate for
Muslims.
Calcutta Session of INC (1906) Dadabhai
Naoroji, the President of the session,
declared that Self Govern- ment or Swaraj,
like that of United Kingdom was the goal of
Indian people.
SURAT SPLIT (1907)
● The INC splited into two groups during
the session at Surat in 1907. Extremists
were led by Lal, Bal, Pal, while
Moderates were led by GK Gokhale.
Moderates
● They demanded mild constitutional
reforms, economic relief,
administrative reorganisation and
protection of civil rights.
Extremists
● They were dissatisfied with the
achievement of the moderates. They
realised that the true nature of British
was exploitative.
● There were 3 groups of extremists The
Maharashtrian group (headed by Bal
Gangadhar Tilak), the Bengal group
(represented by BC Pal and Aurobindo)
and the Punjab group (led by Lala
Lajpat Rai).
● Aurobindo published New lamps for
old in the Indu Prakash in 1893-94. It
was the first systematic critique of the
moderates.
Indian Councils Act of 1909
or the-Morley Minto
Reforms
● Number of elected members in the
imperial and provincial legislative
councils increased. Separate
electorates introduced for Muslims.
● Non-official members to be elected
indirectly. Thus, election introduced for
the first time.

revolutionary movement not only in India,
but outside India as well, by the Indians.
● Indian revolutionary in the United States
of America and Canada had established
the Ghadar (Rebellion) Party in 1913.

Punjabi Sikh peasants and ex-soldiers,
who migrated.
● The party was built around the weekly
paper ‘The Ghadar’, which carried the
caption Angrezi raj ka Dushman.
● Headquarters were at San Francisco.
● The outbreak of the first World War
provided the Ghadarites with an
opportunity to free India from a
government, which was indifferent to
their cause.
● They began to return India in thousands
for a revolt, but unfortunately the
authorities came to know about their
plans and took immediate action. The
rebellious regiments were disbanded and
their leader were either imprisoned or
hanged.
● Some of the prominent Ghadar leaders
were—Baba Gurumukh Singh, Kartar
Singh Saraba, Sohan Singh Bakhna,
Rahmat Ali Shah, Bhai Paramanand and

among them. Police opened fire on
them and 19 passengers died in the
incident.
Home Rule Movement
(1916)
● After Tilak’s return, having served
sentence of six years in Mandlay, he
tried securing the readmission of
himself and other extremists into the
Indian National Congress. With the
need being felt for popular pressure to
attain concessions, disillusionment with
Morley-Minto reforms and wartime
miseries, Tilak and Annie Besant
readied to assume leadership.
● The Home Rule League was pioneered
on lines of a similar movement in
Ireland. Muslim League supported the
movement. Its objective was to work for
social and political reforms.
Tilak’s Home Rule
Movement
● It started in April, 1916 at Poona. Tilak’s
league was to work in Maharashtra,
Karnataka, Central Province and Berar
excluding Bombay. Tilak linked up the
question of Swaraj with the demand for
the formation of linguistic states and
education in Vernacular language.
● He gave the slogan “Swaraj is my birth
right and I shall have it.’’ Tilak’s
newspapers Maratha and Kesari were
organs for home rule.
Annie Besant’s Home Rule
Movement
● Started with George Arundale as
Secretary at Adyar in September, 1916.
Annie Besant's league worked in rest of
India.
● Annie Besant’s newspapers New India
and Commonweal became important
for this movement. She coined the term
Commonwealth.
● Many moderate nationalists, who were
dissatisfied with the Congress inactivity,
joined home rule agitation. In June
1917, Annie Beasant was arrested,
popular pressure forced the government
to release her in September, 1917.
Lucknow Session of the
Congress (1916)
● Presided by a moderate Ambika Charan
Majumdar. The growing nationalist
feeling in the country produced two
historic developments at the Lucknow
Session of the Indian National Congress
in 1916. Firstly-the two wings of the
Congress were reunited, i.e., brought
about an union of moderates and
extremists.
● Secondly at Lucknow, the Congress and
the All India Muslim League sank their
old differences and put up a common
political demand for representative
government and dominion status, before
the government. Congress accepted the
separate electorates. This led to
Congress-League Pact.
Montague Declaration (1917)
● A British policy was announced after the
Lucknow pact, which came to be known
as the August Declaration. It aimed at
‘‘increasing association of Indians in
every branch of the administration for
progressive realisation of responsible
government in India. The declaration
formed the basis of
Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, of
1919.
Rowlatt Act (1919)
● In 1919, a Sedition Committee headed
by Justice Rowlatt led to the Rowlatt
Act. This act authorised the government
to imprison any person without trial and
conviction by the Court of Law for 2
years. The law also enabled the
government to suspend the right of
Habeas Corpus, which had been the
foundation of Civil Liberties in Britain. It
led to a countrywide agitation and
marked the foundation of
Non-Cooperation Movement.
● During March and April 1919, the
country witnessed a remarkable political
awakening. There were hartals, strikes,
processions and demonstrations.
92
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
Gandhi’s Return to India
● Gandhi returned to India in January,
1915. He did not join any political

First Non-Cooperation Movement. Due
to failure of crops, the farmers, with
Gandhi, withheld the revenue to get
remission based on revenue code.
Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
(13th April, 1919)
● The dissatisfaction against Rowlatt Act
led to mass agitations. A large but
unarmed crowd had gathered on 13th
April, 1919 at Amritsar (Punjab) in
the Jallianwala Bagh, to protest
against the arrest of their popular
leaders Dr Saif-ud-din Kitchlew and
Dr Satyapal.
● General Dyer, the Military
Commander of Amritsar, decided to
terrorise the people of Amritsar into
complete submission. Jallianwala
Bagh was a large open space, which
was enclosed on three sides and had
only one exit. General Dyer
surrounded the Bagh, closed the exit
with his troops and then ordered his
men to shoot into the crowd.
Thousands were killed and wounded.
● Rabindranath Tagore returned his
knighthood in protest.
● Hunter Commission was appointed to
inquire into it.
● On 13th March, 1940, Sardar Udham
Singh killed Dyer, when the latter was
addressing a meeting in Coxton Hall,
London.
The Khilafat Movement
(1920-1922)
● During the first World War, Turkey allied
with Germany and Austria against British.
The Indian Muslim regarded the Sultan of
Turkey as their spiritual leader, Khalifa.
● After the war, the British removed the
Khalifa from his power and fragmented
Turkey. Hence, the Muslim started the
Khilafat Movement in India, for the
restoration of Khalifa’s position.
● The leaders were Ali brothers (Shaukat Ali
and Mohammed Ali), Maulana Azad,
Hakim Ajmal Khan and Hasrat Mohani.
Gandhi saw this as an opportunity to bring
about Hindu-Muslim unity against the
British, although CR Das opposed it
initially.
● The Central Khilafat Committee met at
Allahabad. The meeting was attended by
number of Congress and Khilafat leaders. In
this meeting, a programme of
non-cooperation towards the government
was declared. This included boycott of
titles conferred by the government, boycott
of civil services, army and police, i.e., of all
government services.
Non-Cooperation Movement
(1920-1922)
● It was the first mass based political
movement under Gandhi.
● The decision to not cooperate in the most
peaceful manner with the government and
its laws, was endorsed at the annual session
of the Congress held at Nagpur, in 1920.
The Nagpur Session also made changes in
the Constitution of the Congress.
● Anti-Rowlatt agitation, Jallianwala Bagh
tragedy, Khilafat Movement, general
economic distress during and after the war
were the reasons for Non-Cooperation
Movement.
● The Tilak Swarajya Fund started
financing the Non-Cooperation Movement.
The movement envisaged boycott of
school, colleges, law courts, foreign cloth
and advocated the use of Charkha.
93
● Boycott of the forthcoming visit of Prince
of Wales in November, 1921.
● Popularisation of Charkha and Khadi
and Jail Bharo by Congress volunteers.
● The movement demanded-Swaraj or
self rule and Redressal of the Punjab
wrongs and Khilafat issue.
● Lala Lajpat Rai organised educational
Boycott in Punjab.
● CR Das, C Rajagopalachari, Saif-ud-din
Kitchlew, VB Patel, Aruna Asaf Ali and
Motilal Nehru gave up their legal
practice.
● The Congress Session at Allahabad in
December, 1921 decided to launch a
Civil Disobedience Movement. But
before it could be launched, the angry
peasants (mob) attacked on a police
station at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur
district of Uttar Pradesh on 5th February,
1922. This changed the whole situation
and Gandhiji was compelled to withdraw
the Non-Cooperation Movement.
Spread of Non-Cooperation
Movement
● United Province became a strong base
for the Non-Cooperation Movement.
● Agrarian-riots under the leadership of
Baba Ramchandra, Eka Movement
under Madari Pasi.
● In Punjab–Akali Movement for reform
and control of Gurudwaras.
● In Andhra Pradesh, the NonCooperation Movement was a great
success. Alluri Sitaram Raju organised
the tribals in Andhra and combined their
demands with those of the
Non-Cooperation Movement.
The Swarajists
● Major developments in Indian politics
occurred during 1922–28. Differences
arose among leaders after the
withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation
Movement. One school of thought
headed by CR Das and Motilal Nehru

advocated that nationalists should end the
boycott of legislative council, enter them,
obstruct their working according to official
plans, expose their weaknesses, transform
them into arenas of political struggle and
thus use them to arouse public
enthusiasm. They were 'pro-changers’.
● Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr Ansari, Babu
Rajendra Prasad and others opposed
council entry. They were known as ‘no
changers’.
● In December, 1922, CR Das and Motilal
Nehru formed Congress- Khilafat Swarajya
Party, with CR Das as President and
Motilal Nehru as Secretary. It worked
within the Congress.
● In the 1923 elections, the Swarajists won
42 seats out of the 101 elected seats in the
Central Legislative Assembly. With the
cooperation of other Indian group, they
repeatedly out-voted the government in
the Central Assembly and in several of the
provincial councils.
● Swarajists were split by Communalism.
The responsivists offered cooperation to
the government to safeguard the Hindu
interests. Madan Mohan Malaviya and
Lala Lajpat Rai founded the Independent
Congress Party, later in 1933. It was
recognised as Congress Nationalist Party.
Simon Commission (1927)
● In 1927, the British Government
appointed the Indian Statutory
Commission, known popularly by its
chairman Simon to go into the question of
further Constitutional Reform.
● The committee had to review the working
of the dyarchy system, introduced by
Montague Chelmsford Reform of 1919
and to report to what extent a
representative government can be
introduced in India.
● All the members of the commission were
white.
● The Indians protested, against the Simon
Commission, because of the exclusion of
Indians from the Commission and in the
fear that the foreigners would discuss and
decide upon India’s fitness for self
government.
● The National Congress decided to
boycott the commission in its Madras
Session in 1927, presided over by Dr
Ansari.
● The Muslim League and Hindu
Mahasabha decided to support the
Congress.
● The Commission’s arrival in India led
to a powerful protest. On 3rd February,
1928, the Commission was greeted
with Hartals and black flag
demonstrations, under the slogan
Simon Go Back.
● The government used brutal
suppression and police attacks to break
the popular opposition.
● At Lahore, Lala Lajpat Rai was severely
beaten in a Lathi charge and he
succumbed to his injuries on 17th
November, 1929.
Nehru Report (1928)
● All important Indian leaders and parties
tried to meet the challenge of the Simon
Commission by getting together and
trying to evolve an alternative scheme of
Constitutional Reforms. Nehru report
was tabled in 1928 by Motilal Nehru.
● It remains memorable as the first major
Indian effort to draft a constitutional
framework for whole India with lists of
central and provincial subjects and
Fundamental Rights.
● However, the recommendations evoked
a debate concerning the goal of
India-Dominion status or Complete
independence.
● Other members of committee—Tej
Bahadur Sapru, Ali Imam, MS Aney,
Mangal Singh, Sohaib Qureshi, GR
Pradhan and SC Bose.
Outcome of the Nehru Report
● It demanded responsible government
both at the centre and in the provinces.
But, it advocated dominion status, not
complete independence.
● It demanded Universal Suffrage. It
rejected separate communal electorate.
It proposed Muslim reservation in the
centre and provinces, where they were
in minority.
95
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History

that if Lord Irwin accepted them, then
there will be no agitation.
● The Civil Disobedience Movement
was started by Gandhi on 12th March,
1930 with his famous Dandi March.
Together with 78 chosen followers,
Gandhi walked nearly 375 km from
Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, a village
on the Gujarat sea-coast.
● Salt production had geographical limitations.
So, in other parts of the country, the
movement included– picketing of liquor
shops and auctions, no revenue campaign in
Bardoli, defiance of forest laws in
Maharashtra, Karnataka and the central
provinces, refusal of chaukidari tax in
Eastern India, prabhat pheris-singing of

They were pledged to non-violence and
freedom struggle. Two platoons of Garhwali
soldiers refused to open fire on non-violent
mass demonstrations.
● North-East India Manipur took a brave part
in it and Nagaland produced a brave
heroine, Rani Gaidilieu, who at the age of
13 responded to the call of Gandhi. The
young Rani was captured in 1932 and
sentenced to life imprisonment. She was
released only after the independence of

summoned the First Round Table
Conference in London, in 1930, to discuss
the Simon Commission report. But, the
National Congress boycotted the

96
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
First Round Table Conference
(12th November, 1930)
● Congress boycotted the conference.
● Muslim League was represented by
Mohammad Ali, Agha Khan, Fazlul Haq, MA
Jinnah and Hindu Mahasabha by Moonje and
Jayakar.
● Tej Bahadur Sapru, Chintamani and Srinivas
Shastri (Liberals) appeared.
● Princes of Hyderabad, Mysore attended it. No
result came out of the conference.
● The government now made attempts to
negotiate an agreement with the Congress, so
that it could attend the Round Table
Conference.
● Moderate statesman Jaikar, Sapru and
Srinivas Shastri initiated efforts to break
the ice between Gandhiji and the government.
The negotiation between Irwin and Gandhi in
5th March, 1931 came to be known
Gandhi-Irwin Pact or known Delhi Pact.
Gandhi-Irwin Pact
■ Under this pact, the government agreed to release
all those political prisoners, who had remained
non-violent. The Right to make salt for consumption
was agreed to.
■ The Congress was to suspend Civil Disobedience
Movement and take part in Second Round Table
Conference.
Karachi Session (1931)
● It endorsed the Gandhi–Irwin Pact. This
Session is also memorable for its resolution on
Fundamental Right and National Economic
Programme, with the efforts of Jawaharlal
Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose.
● Six days before this session, Bhagat Singh,
Sukhdev, Rajguru were executed.
Second Round Table Conference
(1931)
● Gandhiji went to England in September, 1931,
along with Sarojini Naidu, Mahadev Desai, GD
Birla and Madan Mohan Malviya to attend the
Second Round Table Conference. But the
British Government refused to concede the
basic nationalist demand for freedom on the
basis of the immediate grant of dominion
status with complete control over defence,
external affairs and finance.
● On his return, Gandhiji resumed the Civil
Disobedience movement in 1932 and finally
withdrew it in 1934.
Poona Pact (Communal
Award) (1932)
● McDonald announced the proposal
on minority representation, known
as the Communal Award in 1932.
Under this the depressed classes
(Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians,
Anglo Indians, Women and
Backward Classes) were to be
considered as a minority, would be
entitled to the right of separate
electorate. Gandhi reacted strongly
to the proposal. He considered the
depressed class as the integral part
of Hindu society.
● He thought that there was no need
to protect the depressed classes
through representation, rather the
need was to eradicate
untouchability.
● Gandhi restored to fast unto death
in Yervada Jail (Poona) against this
separate electorate for depressed
class, which Ambedkar was
insisting on. This resulted into the
Poona-Pact between Gandhi and
Ambedkar on 25th September,
1932.
● 147 seats were to be alloted to the
depressed classes in the provincial
legislature as against 71 provided
by the Communal Award. The pact
also called for adequate
representation of depressed classes
in civil services.
● Gandhiji coined the word Harijan
for depressed classes and their
upliftment became his prime
concern. All India Anti
Untouchability League was started
in September, 1932. On 8th May,
1933 Gandhiji decided to begin a
21 day fast for self purification for
the Harijan cause.
Impacts of Civil
Disobedience Movement
● The Congress swept polls in most
provinces in 1937. The left parties
emerged as an alternative in
politics.
● Some Congress activists formed
Socialist group.
● Nehru and Subhash Bose emerged
as leaders.
97
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
Third Round Table Conference
● Held in London in 1932.
● The Congress did not participate.
● The discussion led to Government of
India Act, 1935.
Government of India
Act, 1935
● The discussions of the Third Round
Table Conference and Simon
Commission report eventually led to the
passing of the Goverment of India Act of
1935. The act provided for the
establishment of an All India Federation
and a new system of government for the
Provinces on the basis of provincial
autonomy.
● It abolished the Council of India,
established by the Government of India
Act, 1858.
● The act provided for a Federal Court and
a Federal Bank.
● The Congress rejected the 1935 Act and
demanded the convening of a
constitutional assembly elected on the
basis of adult franchise to frame a
Constitution for independent India.
Second World War
● Lord Linlithgow declared India to be at
war without the prior assent of the
Central Legislature. The Congress
Ministry resigned in the wake of the war.
● Congress agreed to support Britain only
in return of independence being granted.
The viceroy could promise this only after
the war. In October-November 1939, the
Congress Ministries resigned in protest.
The Muslim League observed this as the
Deliverence Day (22nd December,
1939). The Satyagraha was kept limited
so as not to embarass Britain’s war effort
by a mass upheaval in India.
● The viceroy refused to accept
preconditions set by the Congress.
(Constituent Assembly for establishment
of Responsible Government at the
Centre). But, the British Government
desperately wanted the active
cooperation of Indians in the war effort.
To secure this cooperation, it sent to
India in March, 1942, a mission headed
by a Cabinet Minister Sir Stafford Cripps
and before that the August Offer.
August Offer (1940)
The Viceroy Linlithgow put forward a
proposal that included-
● Dominion status in the unspecified
future.
● A post war body to enact Constitution.
● Expansion of Governor-General’s
council with representation of the
minorities.
● Establishment of a War Advisory Council.
● Congress rejected this offer as there was
no suggestion for a National Government.
Muslim League accepted it.
Individual Satyagraha
● Congress rejected the August offer
because Congress was convinced that
the British would not modify their policy
in India. Gandhi decided to start the
Individual Satyagraha in September
1940.
● Vinoba Bhave was the first to offer
individual Satyagraha, followed by
Jawaharlal Nehru and Brahma Dutt.
● Delhi Chalo Movement began.
Cripps Mission, 1942
● A mission under Sir Stafford Cripps was
sent to India in march 1942. He proposed
a Dominion status. The British
Government’s refusal of accepting
immediately the Congress demand of
forming a National Government was the
cause of failure of the mission.
Constitutional Proposal of
the Cripps Mission
(a) Dominion status to be granted after
the war.
(b) Constitution making body to be
elected from provincial assemblies
and nominated by the rulers in case of
princely states.
(c) Individual princes could sign a
separate agreement with the British.
(d) British would however, control the
defence for war period.
The British Government undertook to
accept and implement the Constitution
on two conditions:
● Any province(s) unwilling to accept the
Constitution could form a separate
union with separate Constitution.
98
● The new Constitution making body and
the British Government would negotiate
a treaty to sort out matters arising out of
transfer of power to Indian hands.
● Gandhi termed this proposal as a post
dated cheque in a crashing bank.
● Though, Cripps proposal failed but it
provided legitimacy to the demand for
Pakistan by accomodating it in the
provision for provincial autonomy.
Quit India Movement, 1942
● The All India Congress Committee met
at Bombay on 8th August, 1942. It
passed the famous Quit India resolution
and proposed to start off a non-violent
mass struggle under Gandhi’s
leadership.
● It is also called Wardha proposal and
leaderless revolt.
● Gandhi told the British to quit and leave
India in God’s hand. His message was Do
or Die.
● Repressive policy of the government and
indiscriminate arrest of the leaders
provoked people to violence.
● Nehru was lodged in Almora jail,
Maulana Azad in Bankura and Gandhi
was kept in Agha Khan’s palace, Poona.
In many areas, government lost control
and the people established Swaraj.
Parallel governments were established.
● In Satara, Pratisarkar was set up under
Nana Patil and in Baliya under Chittu
Pande. Others were in Talcher and
Bihar. In Bengal, Tamluk Jatiya Sarkar
functioned in Midnapore.
● Underground revolutionary activity also
started by Jaiprakash Narain and
Ramanandan Mishra escaped from
Hazaribagh Jail and organised an
underground movement.
● In Bombay, the socialist leaders
continued their underground activities
under leaders like Aruna Asaf Ali.
Congress radio was established with
Usha Mehta as its announcer and
Rammanohar Lohia in Bihar.
● School and college students and women
actively participated, workers went on
strikes. There were no communal
clashes during the movement.
● The merchant community and capilatist
did not participate. Muslim League kept
aloof and the Hindu Mahasabha
condemned the movement. Communist
party did not support the movement.
Rajagopalachari also did not participate.
Demand for Pakistan
● In 1930, Md Iqbal for the first time
suggested that the Frontier Province,
Sind, Baluchistan and Kashmir be made
the Muslim state within the federation.
● Chaudhary Rehmat Ali coined the term
‘Pakistan’ (later Pakistan).
● The fear of Muslims to be subjugated by
Hindus in free India was realised by
Jinnah and he demanded for the
creation of Pakistan.

oldest unbroken musical traditions in the
World.
Many different legends have grown up
concerning the origin and development of
Indian classical music.
Hindustani Music
Classical Music
● Hindustani classical music originated in
North India around the 13th and 14th
centuries. In contrast to Carnatic music,
the Hindustani classical music was not
only influenced by ancient Hindu
musical traditions and Vedic philosophy,
but also by the Persian elements.
● Hindustani music is based on the Raga
system. The Raga is a melodic scale,
comprising of notes from the basic seven
- Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni.
● On the basis of notes included in it, each
raga attains a different character. The
form of the raga is also determined by
112 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
the particular pattern of ascent and
descent of the notes, which may not be
strictly linear.
● Hindustani classical music is primarily
vocal-centric. The major vocal forms
associated with Hindustani classical
music are the khayal, ghazal, dhrupad,
Tappa, tarana and thumri.
Khayal
It is a form of vocal music adopted from
medieval Persian music. It is based on
imagination and improvisations of the
performer.
Dhrupad
It is the oldest form of Hindustani music,
traditionally performed by male singers. It is
mostly a poetic form. Tansen Sang in
dhrupad style.
Tappa
It is developed in 18th century from the folk
songs of camel riders of Punjab. They are
essentially folklore of love and passion and
written in Punjabi. Developed as a form of
classical music by Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori.
Tarana
It is a medium to fast paced song usually
performed towards the end of the concert. It
consists of a few lines of poetry with
rhythmic syllables.
Thumri
It is an informal vocal form of Hindustani
classical music and is said to have begun
with the court of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the
Nawab of Oudh.
Ghazal
It is a poetic form consisting of rhyming
couplets on love and devotion.
It is an ancient form originating in 6th
century Arabic poetry. It spread into South
Asia in the 12th century, due to the influence
of Sufi mystics.
Gharana
There is a rich tradition of Gharanas in
classical Hindustani music. These schools
or Gharanas have their basis in the
traditional mode of musical training and
education. Every Gharana has its own
distinct features.
Gwalior Gharana
This is the oldest among all the Khayal
Gayaki (vocal) styles. Its distinctive
feature is its lucidity and simplicity. It is
founded by Hassu Khan and Nathu Khan.
Agra Gharana
The Agra Gharana places great
importance on developing forcefulness
and deepness in the voice, so that the
notes are powerful and resonant founded
by Haji Sujan Khan.
Kirana Gharana
It derives its name from the birth-place of
Abdul Kharim Khan of Kirana near
Kurukshetra. In the Kirana style of
singing, the swara is used to create an
emotional mood by means of elongation
and use of Kana-s.
Rampur Sahaswan Gharana
In Rampur Sahaswan Gharana, there is a
stress on the clarity of swara and the
development and elaboration of the raga
is done through a stepwise progression.
Founded by Inayat Khan.
Patiala Gharana
Founded by Inayat Khan. Regarded as an
off-shoot of the Delhi Gharana, the
Patiala Gharana is characterised by the
use of greater rhythm play and by
Layakari with the abundant use of Bols,
particularly Bol tans founded by ustad
Fateh Ali Khan.
Delhi Gharana
The Delhi Gharana was represented by
Tanras Khan and Shabbu Khan. The
highlights of Delhi Gharana are pleasing
vistaar and exquisite compositions.
Founded by Ustad Mamman Khan.
Banaras Gharana
The Banaras Gharana evolved as a result
of great tilting style of khayal singing
known by Thumri singers of Banaras and
Gaya. Founded by Pt. Gopal Mishra.
Mewati Gharana
The Mewati Gharana gives importance to
developing the mood of the raga through
the notes forming it and its style is Bhava
Pradhan. It also gives equal importance
to the meaning of the text.

ARCHITECTURE
Indian architecture, which has evolved
through centuries, is the result of
socio-economic and geographical
conditions of the region. Indian
architecture evolved in various stages in
different parts and regions of the country.
Apart from the natural evolution Indian
architecture was generally affected by
many great and important historic
developments.
Rajput Architecture
● The Rajputs were great patrons of art and
architecture, the finest examples being
their forts and palaces. The Rajput
palaces are complex compositions built
as inner citadels surrounded by the city
and enclosed by a fortified wall as at
Chittorgarh and Jaisalmer. Some forts,
such as those at Bharatpur and Deeg,
were protected by wide moats.
● The palaces of Jaisalmer, Bikaner,
Jodhpur, Udaipur and Kota represent the
maturity of the Rajput style.
Deccan Style
● The architecture of the Deccan is
marked by its distinct originality and
independence of style, unlike the
architectural styles of the other
provinces, which combined both the
temple architecture and the Islamic
building ideals. It derived its elements
from the architectural styles of the
Sultan of Delhi and that of the distant
Persia.
● Some key features of this style are the
presence of bulbous domes with lotus
neck, military style of architecture,
presence of thick walls and combination
of gateway and mosque-like Charminar.
Mughal Style
● The medieval period saw great
developments in the field of architecture.
With the coming of Muslims to India,
many new features came to be
introduced in buildings. The
development of Muslim style of
architecture of this period can be called
the Indo-Islamic architecture or the
Indian architecture influenced by
Islamic Art.
● The Indo-Islamic style was neither
strictly Islamic nor strictly Hindu.
● The earliest building of this period is
Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque and the
Qutub Minar at Delhi.
PUPPETRY
● The early puppet shows in India dealt
mostly with histories of great kings.
Princes and heroes and also political
satire in rural areas.
● There are four types of puppetry in
India—String puppets, Shadow puppets,
Rod puppets and Glove puppets.
PAINTING
The history of Indian paintings is just about
as old as the history of the people of India.
The most primitive instances of paintings
in India can be traced back to cave
paintings of Bhimbetka.
Mughal School
● This school has a specific style of South
Asian painting. Usually, it was confined
to miniatures either as book depictions
or as individual works to be kept in
albums.
● This practice materialised from Persian
miniature painting, with Indian
influences of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain.
● It wonderfully blossomed during the
Mughal Empire. Later, this school of
painting reached other Indian courts of
Muslims and Hindus and afterwards
Sikhs.
● Akbar and Jahangir were exceptionally
great patrons of this painting. Mughal
School of painting revolved around court
scenes, portraits, hunting scenes, lovers,
battle fronts etc.
Rajput School
● This school progressed and thrived
during the 18th century in the majestic
Rajputana courts.
● This school of painting flooded from the
approach of Mughal painting.
● A typical style of painting with particular
common characteristics came up in
every Rajput realm.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian History
● This school illustrated an assortment of themes like landscapes, events from the
Mahabharata, Ramayana, Krishna’s life and about human beings.
Bengal School
● This school was a fashion of art, which progressed during the British Raj of India in
early 20th century.
● Indian Nationalism was greatly linked to this painting. British art administrators also
supported and promoted it.
● Raja Ravi Verma and Abanindranath Tagore were amongst the pioneer artists of this
school. Today’s renowned artists, who belong to this School include Nilima Dutta,
Sudip Roy, Paresh Maiti and Bikash Bhattacharjee.

GEOGRAPHY
● Geography is the science that studies
the lands, the features, the inhabitants
and the phenomena on the Earth.
● The discipline of geography was
invented in the 2nd century BC by the
Greek Scholar Eratosthenes.
Branches of Geography
Geography is divided into two main
branches i.e. physical geography and
human geography.
Some Contributors
to Geography
■ Eratosthenes was the first person to
calculate the circumference of the Earth
and also calculate the tilt of the Earth’s
axis.
■ Anaximander created the first map of
world.
■ Varahamihira’s Brihatsamhita gave a
thorough description of planetary
movements, rainfall, clouds etc.
■ Ptolemy first presented India on the
world map.
■ The History of Mankind was written by
Friedrich Ratzel.
Human Geography
Human geography is a branch of the
geography that studies the world, its
people, communities and cultures, with
an emphasis on relations of land across
space and place.
The fields of human geography are as follow:
● Cultural geography
● Development geography
● Economic geography
● Transport geography
● Historical geography
● Political geography
● Population geography
● Settlement geography
Physical Geography
Physical geography deals with the physical
environment and the various process that
bring about changes in the physical
environment on the Earth surface.
The fields of physical geography are as follow:
● Geomorphology It is the scientific study of
landforms and processes that shape them.
● Hydrology It is the study of the
movement, distribution and quality of
water on Earth, including the hydrological
cycle, water resources and environmental
watershed sustainability.
● Climatology It is the study of climate,
which is scientifically defined as weather
conditions averaged over a period of time.
● Pedology It is the study of soils in their
natural environment.
● Glaciology It is the study of glaciers and
ice sheets.
● Biogeography It is the study of
relationships of organisms with their
environment.
WORLD GEOGRAPHY
Universe
● The universe is commonly defined as the
totality of everything that exists
including all physical matter and energy,
the planets, stars, galaxies and the
contents of intergalactic space.
● The study of universe is known as
Cosmology.
● The universe comprises of billions of
galaxies. The galaxies are made up of
millions of stars held together by the
force of gravity and these stars account
for most of the masses of the galaxy.
● Our own galaxy is called the Milky Way
(or the Akash Ganga) and it contains
about 300 billion stars and one of these is
the Sun. Planets and other objects
revolve around the Sun and make up the
solar system with the Sun at the
centre.Andromeda is our nearest galaxy.
● In AD 140, Ptolemy propounded the
theory that the Earth was the centre of
the universe and the Sun and the other
heavenly bodies revolved around it.
● In 1543, Copernicus said that the Sun
and not the Earth is the centre of
universe.
● Kepler supported Copernicus but said
that the Sun is the centre of solar system
and not the universe.
● In 1924, Edwin Hubble first
demonstrated existence of galaxies
beyond Milky Way.
● Structurally, the galaxies are found in
three forms
(i) Spiral galaxies have a central
nucleus with great spiral arms. Milky
Way and Andromeda are the
examples.
(ii) Elliptical galaxies are without spiral
arms and have ellipsoid shape.
(iii) Irregular galaxies have no shape.
Evolution of Universe
The three main theories put forward to
explain the origin and evolution of the
universe are
(i) Big Bang Theory (Proposed by
Georges Lemaitre) Big Bang was an
explosion that occurred 13.8 billion
years ago, leading to the formation of
galaxies of stars and other heavenly
bodies.
(ii) Steady State Theory Bondi, Gold and
Fred Hoyle developed this theory. It
states that although the universe is
expanding, it nevertheless does not
change its appearance over time and
it has no beginning and no end.
(iii) The Pulsating Theory According to
this theory, the universe is supposed
to be expanding and contracting
alternately i.e. pulsating. At present,
the universe is expanding.
NASA has launched the Cosmic
Background Explorer (COBE) and the
Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe
(WMAP) missions to study the radiation
present in the universe.
Stars
● Stars are heavenly bodies made up of hot
burning gases. They produce their own
light.
● A neutron star is about 20 km in
diameter and has a mass of about 1.4
times that of the Sun. Neutron stars are
formed by supernova explosions. A
pulsar is a highly magnetised and
rotating neutron star.
● A star’s colour indicates the temperature
of its surface. Blue colour denotes
maximum temperature. White, yellow,
orange, red stars have sequentially
declining range of temperatures.
Evolutionary Stages of a Star
1. Proto Star It is the stage, where the
helium core become increasingly
heavy, accompanied with expanding
outer layers.
2. Red Giant This stage results into
the swelling and reddening of the
outer regions of the star. Such stars of
gigantic dimension is called Red Star.
3. White Dwarf If the mass of the star
is relatively small like that of our Sun,
the gases that reach the outer layer
are expelled. As these expelled gases
cool and contract, the star becomes a
White Dwarf.
Stars: Quick Digest
■ Brightest star outside solar system is Sirius,
also called as Dog Star.
■ Closest star to our solar system is Proxima
Centauri (4.2 light years away) followed by
Alpha Centauri (4.3 light years away) and
Barnard’s Star (5.9 light years away).

Concept of Black Hole and
Chandrashekhar Limit
● A renowned Indian Physicist Chandrashekhar had predicted an upper limit to the
mass of stars, which is called as
Chandrashekhar limit. It is 1.44 times the
mass of the Sun.
● Above the upper limit, two conditions are
possible.
1. Explosion of the star to form neutron
star.
2. Collapse and compaction of the stars to
form Black Hole.
● The black holes are formed due to collapse
and compaction under gravity, at the end of
the life cycle of a star.
● Some of the units used for the calculation of
distances in universe are as follows:
Units of Distance
Unit Description of the Unit
Light year It is the distance that light can
travel in 1 year. It is equal to almost
9 46 1012
. × km.
Astronomical
unit
It is the average distance
between the Sun and the Earth.
1AU = 150 million km
Parsec It is the distance from the Earth to
a star that has parallax of 1 arc
second. The actual length is
about 3.262 light years.
SOLAR SYSTEM
● The solar system comprises the Sun, 8
planets, their satellites and other
non-stellar objects, which are believed to
have been developed from the
condensation of gases and other lesser
bodies.
● The Sun is at the centre of the solar system
and all the planets revolve around it in an
elliptical orbit. It is the nearest star to the
Earth.
● The end of Solar System is about 122
AU (Astronomical units) away from
the Sun.
Components of the
Solar System
Our Solar System consists of
● The Sun, Eight planets (excluding
Pluto) and their respective satellites.
● Interstellar debris such as asteroids,
meteoroids, comets.
● The electrically charged gases, called
Plasma.
● Interplanetary dust particles.
● the components of solar system other
than planets, dwarf planets and
satellites are called as Small Solar
System Bodies (SSSB).

THE SUN
● The Sun accounts for more than
99 per cent of the mass of the Solar
System and due to this, the Sun
exerts immense gravitational pull on
the planets to keep them rotating
around it in definite elliptical orbit.
● The Sun is the major source of energy
in the solar system. The energy is
provided by the nuclear fusion
reaction, that converts hydrogen into
helium in the core of the Sun.

SUN
● The glowing surface of the Sun that we see
is called Photosphere. Above the
photosphere is the red coloured
Chromosphere and beyond it is the
magnificent corona, which is most easily
visible during eclipses.
¡ Hydrogen and helium are the main gases
present in the Sun.
¡ The sun has a surface temperature of
about 6000°C.
¡ It takes 224 million years to complete one
circle (revolution) around the centre of
the Milky Way. This is known as a Cosmic
year.
¡ The Sun is 1300000 times bigger than the
Earth in terms of volume.
● Superimposed on Sun’s white light are
hundred of dark lines called Fraunhofer
lines. Each line indicates some elements
existing as gases in the Solar System.

Concepts Associated with the Sun
● Solar Winds The Sun is continuously
emitting streams of photons in all
directions either as spiral streams called
Solar Wind or bouts of incandescent
material called Solar Flares. Solar flares
increases ionisation in upper atmosphere
and thus pose danger to satellite
communication.
● Aurora The constituent particles of
the solar wind are trapped by the
Earth’s magnetic field and enter the
Earth’s upper atmosphere as Aurora. It
is described as Aurora Borealis in the
Northern hemisphere and Aurora
Australis in Southern hemisphere.
● Plages and Sunspots The
chromosphere of the Sun is
continuously changing. Bright spots on
the chromosphere are called Plages
and dark spots are called Sunspots.
The Sunspots are cold and dark regions
on the Sun’s surface with a periodicity
of 11 years. These spots greatly
influence the global climate.
PLANETS
● Planets are celestial bodies, which
continuously revolve around and are
lighted by a star. There are eight
planets in the solar system that revolve
around the Sun in an elliptical orbit.
● The sequence of planets according to
their size (in descending order) is
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
Earth, Venus, Mars and Mercury.
● The sequence of planets according to
their distance from the Sun is Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune.

August, 2006 states that, in the solar system, a planet is a celestial body that
¡ it is in orbit around the Sun.
¡ it has sufficient mass so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape.
¡ it has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.
● A non-satellite body fulfilling the first two rule is classified as a Dwarf planet. So, Pluto
was reclassified as a Dwarf planet.

THE EARTH’S
MOVEMENT
● The Earth moves in space in two distinct
ways:Rotation and Revolution.
(i) It rotates on its own axis from West
to East once in every 24 hours. It
causes day and night.
(ii) It revolves around the Sun in an
orbit once in every 365¼ days. It
causes the seasons and the year.
Rotation of Earth
● Spins on its imaginary axis from West to
East in 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09
seconds.
● The rotational speed at equator is
maximum (1667 km/hr) and then
decreases towards the poles, where it is
zero.
● The days and the nights are equal at the
equator.
The rotation of the Earth has the following
implications such as:
■ Causation of day and night.
■ Change in the direction of winds and
ocean currents.
■ Rise and fall of tides everyday.
■ A difference of one hour between the
two meridians which are 15° apart.
Revolution of Earth
● It is the Earth’s motion in elliptical orbit
around the Sun. It takes 365 days, 5
hours, 48 minutes and 45.51 seconds. It
leads to one extra day in every fourth year.
The revolution of the Earth results in
■ changes of season.
■ variation of the length of the days and
nights at different times of the year.
132 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Shifting of the wind belts.
The figure given below shows the revolution of the Earth and its effects on seasons
and the variations of lengths of day and night.
Major Difference Between Rotation and Revolution of Earth
Rotation Revolution
Spinning of Earth on its own axis. Movement of the Earth around the Sun in an elliptical
orbit.
Earth takes 24 hours to complete one
rotation.
The Earth takes 365.25 days to complete one revolution.
Rotation causes day and night. Revolution along with inclination of the Earth on its axis
causes change in seasons.
Earth’s Position wrt Moon
Apogee Perigee
The period of the farthest distance between the
Moon and the Earth is called Apogee. It is about
406000 km.
The period of the nearest distance between the
Moon and the Earth is called Perigee. It is about
356400 km.
Earth’s Position wrt Sun
Perihelion Aphelion
The period of the nearest distance
between the Earth and the Sun is
Perihelion. It happens on 3rd
January and the distance is 147
million km.
The period of the farthest distance between the Earth and the
Sun is Aphelion. It happens on 4th July and the distance is
152 million km.
Tilt of the Earth’s Axis
● The axis of the Earth is inclined to the plane of ecliptic (the plane, in which the Earth
orbits round the Sun) at an angle of 66½°, giving rise to different seasons and varying
lengths of day and night.

Revolution of the Earth
● If the axis were perpendicular to
this plane, all parts of the globe
would have equal days and
nights at all times of the year.
● The Earth is tilted about 23.5°
from a line perpendicular to
ecliptic plane.
Equinoxes
● These are the days, when days
and nights are equal. Under this
situation, the Sun is vertically
overhead at the equator. It
happens on two days of the year
i.e. 21st March and 23rd
September.
● 21st March: Vernal Equinox.
● 23rd September: Autumnal
Equinox.
Summer Solstice
● After the March equinox, the
Sun appears to move Northward
and is vertically overhead at the
Tropic of Cancer on 21st June.
This is known as Summer
Solstice.
● On 21st June, the Northern
hemisphere will have its longest
day and shortest night. The
Southern hemisphere will have
shortest day and longest night.
Winter Solstice
● On 22nd December, the Sun is
overhead at the Tropic of
Capricorn. This is the winter
solstice, when the Southern
hemisphere will have its longest
day and shortest night.
A summary of daylight hours in
the Northern and Southern
hemisphere is as follows:

Seasons
● They are the periods into which the year can be
divided as a result of the climatic conditions,
mainly due to the changes in duration and
intensity of solar radiation.
● There are four seasons:

Latitude
● Latitude is the angular distance of a point on the
Earth’s surface from the centre of the Earth,
measured in degree. These lines are called
parallels of latitude and on the globe they are
represented as circles. The circumference of the
circles decreases from equator to pole and at the
pole it converges to a point.
● The distance between any two parallels of
latitude is always equal. One degree latitude =
111 km (approx). The most important lines of
latitudes are Equator (0°), the Tropic of Cancer
(23½°N), the Tropic of Capricorn (23½°S), the
Arctic Circle (66½°N) and the Antarctic Circle
(66½°S).
Longitude
● Longitude is the angular distance of a point on
the Earth’s surface along the equator, East or
West from the Prime meridian. On the globe,
they form semi-circles from pole to pole passing
through the equator.

● Prime meridian is the semi-circle from pole to
pole, from which all the other meridians
radiate Eastwards and Westwards up to 180°.
In 1884, it has been decided that the zero
degree meridian is the one that passes through
the Royal Astronomical Observatory at
Greenwich near London. 180° meridian
(International Date Line) is exactly opposite to
the prime meridian. Such points are called
antipodal points.
Universal Time (Standard time)
and Time Zones
● To avoid confusion about having many local
times within one country, a particular
meridian is chosen for the whole country,
whose time is known as standard time.
● The Indian Government has accepted the
meridian of 82.5 degree East for standard
time, which is 5 hrs 30 mins ahead
of the Greenwich Mean Time.
● The Earth is divided in 24
longitudinal zones, each being 15
degree or 1 hour apart in time (360
degree = 24 hours, 360/24 =15
degree in 1 hour) or 1 degree in 4
minute are called Standard Time
Zones.
● Larger countries such as USA,
Russia and Canada, which have
greater East-West stretch have to
adopt several time zones for
practical purposes.
● Russia has as many as 11 time zones.
● Both USA and Canada have five
time zones, viz, the Atlantic,
Eastern, Central, Mountain and
Pacific time zones.
● A simple memory aid for time is
East-Gain-Add (EGA) and WestLose-Subtract (WLS).
International Date Line
● It is the 180 degree meridian
running over the Pacific Ocean,
deviating at Aleutian Island, Fiji,
Samoa and Gilbert Island.
● At the International Date Line, the
date changes by exactly one day,
when it is crossed.
● Samoa and Tokelau shifted its
position to the West of the date line
on 30th December, 2011.
ECLIPSE
● An eclipse occurs when the Sun, the Moon and the Earth are in a straight line. There
are two types of eclipses-Solar and Lunar eclipse.

EARTH’S INTERIOR
The interior of Earth is divided into
three parts
(i) Crust (ii) Mantle (iii) Core
The Crust
● The crust is the outermost and the
thinnest layer of the Earth. This
layer has the least density and its
thickness varies about 8 to 40 km.
Mohorovicic Discontinuity or
Moho, marks the lower limit of the
crust. This discontinuity is
identified on the basis of rock
density.
● Thickness of the crust is more in
the continents and lesser in the
oceans while density of continental
crust is lower than oceanic crust.
● The rocks forming the upper layer
of crust of the Earth are rich in
lighter minerals like silica and
aluminium. Hence, this layer is
also called as SiAl (silica and
aluminium). The average density of
this layer is 2.7 gm/cm3
.
● Due to presence of minerals like
silica and magnesium in the lower
part of Earth’s crust, it is also
known as SiMa (silica and
magnesium).
● Sial and Sima together form Earth’s
crust.
The Mantle
● This layer is the intermediate layer
of the Earth in terms of both its
location and density.
● It is about 2900 km in thickness,
composed of minerals in a semisolid state.
● It is divided into further two layer
upper mantle and lower mantle.
The upper part of the mantle is
called the Asthenosphere, which is
about 250 km thick.
● The average density of this layer is about 5.68
gm/cm3
.
● The transitional zone separating the mantle
from the core is called the Gutenberg
Discontinuity.
The Core
● The core is the innermost layer of the Earth
and occupies its centre. It is about 3500 km in
radius.
● The core is further divided into two layers :
outer core and inner core.
● The outer part of the core is believed to have
the properties of a liquid and the innermost
part of the core (about 1255 km in radius)
may be called solid or crystalline.
● This layer is also known as NiFe (nickel and
iron), because this layer contain large
concentration of iron and nickel.
● Temperature of the core is between 2200°C
and 2750° C.
● Density of this part of the Earth is
13.6 gm/cm3
and is many times greater than
the average density of the Earth
(5.53 gm/cm3
).

Continental Drift Theory
● This theory is given by Alfred
Wegener, in 1915, to explain the
origin and evolution of the continents
and the oceans. According to this
theory, about 250 million years ago,
there was only one huge continental
landmass named Pangea and it was
surrounded by one huge mass of water
body, named Panthalassa.
● The present shape of the continents
and oceans is due to the break up of
Pangaea.
● This breaking process started about
200 million years ago.
● The Northern rift cuts Pangea from
East to West creating Laurasia in the
North and Gondwanaland in South. A
shallow sea called Tethys was situated
between the Laurasia and the
Gondwanaland.
Sea Floor Spreading Theory
● The concept of sea floor spreading was first
formulated by Harry Hess in the year
1960.
● According to this theory, the mid oceanic
ridges were situated on the rising thermal
convective current coming from mantle.
● The oceanic crust moves in opposite
directions from mid oceanic ridges and
thus there is continuous upwelling of new
molten materials along the mid oceanic
ridges. These molten masses cool down
and solidify to form new crust.
Plate Tectonics Theory
● Plate tectonic theory is a scientific theory
that describe the large-scale motions of
Earth’s lithosphere.
● The word tectonics comes from the Greek
word meaning builder.
● The theory of Plate tectonics states that
the lithosphere is divided into several rigid
segments, which include both oceanic and
continental crusts. These segments are
called plates and they are moving on the
asthenosphere, which is not a liquid, but a
semi-solid which flows under stress.
● About 20 such plates have been identified.
There are seven major plates such as
Eurasia, Antarctica, North America, South
America, Pacific, African and Indian Plate.
● There are various intermediate sized plates
such as China, Philippine, Arabian, Iran,
Nazca, Cocos, Caribbean and Scotia
Plates.
Plate Margins
Depending upon the type of movement, plate
margins are of three types :
(i) Divergent Plate Margin (Constructive
margins)
(ii) Convergent Plate Margin (Destructive
margins)
(iii) Parallel Plate Margin (Conservative
margin or Transform Boundary)
● Collision can occur between two oceanic
plates, one oceanic and one continental
plate or two continental plates.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 137
FORCES AND PROCESSES AFFECTING THE
EARTH’S CRUST
● Appearance of the surface of the Earth keeps changing.
● These changes are produced under the influence of two type of forces.
These are given below :
EXOGENETIC OR EXTERNAL FORCES
● The forces occurring on the surface of the Earth are called the external or exogenetic
forces.
● Weathering and Erosion are the examples of external forces.
Weathering
It is the process of disintegration or decomposition of rocks in situ by natural agents.
There are three types of weathering
1. Physical Weathering
(or mechanical weathering)
● It involves rock disintegration
without any change in the
chemical constituents of the
rocks.
● The factors responsible for
physical weathering are
temperature change,
crystallisation of water into
ice, the pressure release
mechanism.
2. Chemical Weathering It
involves the decomposition due
to chemical changes. There are
various chemical processes,
which cause chemical weathering such as Solution, Oxidation, Carbonation,
Hydration, Hydrolysis and Chelation.
3. Biological Weathering It is mainly controlled by plants and animals and human
beings. It is divided into three types
(i) Faunal weathering (ii) Floral weathering (iii)Anthropogenic weathering
Erosion
● It involves removal of rock material and their transportation. Erosion is performed by
mobile agents such as rivers, streams, winds, waves and underground water.
138 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Types of Plate Boundary
Divergent Plate Boundary Convergent Plate Boundary Transform Fault Boundary
When the plates move apart
with the upwelling of material
from the mantle, divergent
plate boundary are formed.
A convergent plate boundary is
one, where two plates collide, one
plate bending downward and
subducting below the other.
They are located, where
plates slide past one another
without the creation or
destruction of crust.
Formation of the mid-oceanic
ridges are the example of
divergent plate margin.
Deep oceanic trench is formed
adjacent to the zone of subduction.
Fold mountains are the result of
convergent plate boundary.
San Andreas fault along the
West coast of Mexico is a
famous transform fault.
The Process of Chemical Weathering
Process Mechanism of Chemical Weathering
Solution It involves the dissolution of soluble
particles and minerals from the rocks
with the help of water.
Oxidation It represents addition of oxygen to form
oxides.
Carbonation It is the reaction of carbonate or
bicarbonate ions with minerals.
Hydration It is the process of addition of water to
the minerals.
Hydrolysis It is the process wherein both minerals
of rocks and water moleclues
decompose and react in such a way that
new mineral compounds are formed.
ENDOGENETIC OR
INTERNAL FORCES
● The forces originating in the
interior of the Earth are called the
internal or the endogenetic forces.
● These forces are of two types
Sudden Endogenetic
Forces or Catastrophic
Forces
● Sudden endogenetic forces are the
result of long periods of
preparation deep within the Earth.
● But their cumulative effects on
the Earth’s surface are quick and
sudden.
● Volcanoes, and Earthquakes are
the examples of sudden
endogenetic forces.
Slow and Gradual
Endogenetic Forces or
Diastrophic Forces
● Diastrophic forces include both
vertical and horizontal movements
which are caused due to forces
deep within the Earth. These
diastrophic forces operate very
slowly and there effects become
visible after thousands and millions
of years.
● These forces termed as
constructive forces affects larger
areas of the globe and produce
meso-level reliefs e.g. mountains,
plateaus, plains, tectonic lakes,
big faults etc.
● These diastrophic forces are
further subdivided into two groups
namely epirogenetic forces and
orogenetic forces.
Epirogenetic Force
¡ These are vertical movements.
¡ It causes upliftment and
subsidence of continental masses
through upward movements.
These forces and resultant
movements affect larger parts of
the continents. These are further
divided into two type: upward
movement and downward
movement.
Orogenetic Force
● Orogenetic movement is caused due to
endogenetic forces working in horizontal
movement. Horizontal forces and movements
are also called as tangential forces.
Orogenetic or horizontal forces work in two
ways, namely
(i) in opposite direction from each other and
(ii) towards each other.
● When it operates in opposite direction it is
called tensional force. Tensional force create,
faulting cracking and fracture. Tensional
forces are also called as divergent forces.
● The force, when operates face to face, is called
compressional force or convergent force.
Compressional forces create folding and
warping.
EARTHQUAKES
● It refers to the vibration on the Earth’s surface
caused by the catastrophic endogenetic forces.
● The magnitude or intensity of energy released
by an earthquake is measured by the Richter
Scale, whereas the damage caused is measured
by modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.
● The place of origin of earthquake is called
focus. The place on the ground surface, which
is perpendicular to the focus or hypocentre is
called Epicentre.
● Seismology is the special branch of geology
that deals with the study of earthquake.

EARTHQUAKE WAVES
Earthquake waves are seismic waves that
are created when energy builds up in rocks
and they fracture.
Earthquake waves are basically of two
types : body waves and surface waves.
Body Waves
They are generated due to the release of
energy at the focus and move in all
directions travelling through the body of
the Earth. The body waves interact with
the surface rocks and generate new set of
waves called Surface Wave. There are two
types of body waves, Primary and
Secondary waves.
1. Primary Waves
Primary Waves (P Waves) These are the
waves of short wavelength and high
frequency. They are longitudinal waves
and can travel through solid, liquid and
gases.
2. Secondary Waves
Secondary Waves (S Waves) These are the
waves of short wavelength and high
frequency. They are transverse waves,
which travel through only solid particles.
Surface Waves or Long
Waves (L Waves)
They are the waves of long wavelength, and
they travel through the Earth’s crust. It
causes most of the structural damage on
the surface of Earth during an earthquake.
THE EARTHQUAKE
ZONES IN INDIA
The Indian plate is moving from South to
North at the speed of 5 cm/year and the
Eurasian Plate is static at its own fixed
position, so there is a collision between
Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. Due to
this collision, the earthquakes occurs in
the Himalayan region of India. The
collision also results in the increase of the
height of Himalayas at the speed of 1
cm/year.
● An important earthquake zone is located
parallel to Punjab and Rann of Kachchh.
It occurs due to the movement between
the transform boundaries of Eurasian
and Indian Plates.
● Earthquakes occur in Assam,
Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Tripura,
Manipur, Mizoram, Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Jammu and Kashmir,
the North-Western region of Uttar
Pradesh and the Northern region of
Bihar etc.
Distribution of Earthquakes
Most of the world’s earthquakes occur in
● the zones of young fold mountain
● the zones of folding and faulting
● the zone of junction of continental and
oceanic margin
● the zone of active volcanoes
● along different plate boundaries
The traditional zones of earthquakes are
¡ Circum Pacific belt
¡ Mid Continental belt
¡ Mid Atlantic belt
SHADOW ZONE
● There are some specific area where
earthquake waves do not occur or occur
rarely. Such areas are termed as Shadow
zones.
● It is located between 105° and 140° from
epicentre.
VOLCANISM
● Volcanism includes all phenomena
connected with the movement of heated
material from the interior towards the
surface of the Earth.

Earthquake Waves
● A volcano is a vent or opening, through which heated molten materials consisting of
gases, water, liquid lava, fragments of rocks are ejected from the highly heated and
melted interior to the surface of the Earth.
Volcanic eruptions are closely associated with several integrated processes such as:
● Gradual increase in temperature with increasing depth, due to the heat generated by
degeneration of radioactive elements inside the Earth.
● Origin of magma due to the lowering of the melting point caused by reduction in
pressure of overlying rocks which is due to fractures caused by splitting of plates.
● Origin of gases and water vapour due to heating of water.
● Ascent of magma due to pressure from gases and vapour.
● Occurrence of volcanic eruption.
Classification of Volcanoes
On the Basis of Mode of Eruption
Central Eruption or Explosive Type Fissure Eruption or Quiet Eruption
Here the magma comes with great force
through the small vent and forms volcanic
cones. e.g. Hawaiian type, Strombolian type,
Pelean type, Vesuvious type, etc.
Large quantities of lava quietly flow up from
fissures and spread out over the surrounding
areas. Successive flow of lava results in the growth
of lava plateau. e.g. Deccan Plateau.
On the Basis of Periodicity of Eruptions
Active Volcanoes Dormant Volcanoes Extinct Volcanoes
Those volcanoes that
frequently erupt or they
have erupted in recent
times. e.g. Mt. Etna in
Italy.
Those volcanoes that have been
known to erupt and show signs
of possible eruptions in future.
e.g., Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa
Volcanoes that have not erupted at
all in historic times but they retain the
features of a volcano.
e.g. Mt. Chimborazo in Ecuador
Volcanic Belts
● Circum-Pacific Belt (Fire girdle of the Pacific or the fire ring of the Pacific). It
extends across the Kamchatka Peninsula, Kurile Islands, the Islands of Japan,
Philippines, New Guinea, New Zealand and the Soloman Islands.
● Major volcanic peaks in the circumpacific belt includes Mt. Krakatoa, Mt. Saint
Helens, Mt. Ruapehu, Mt. Fuji, Mt. Popo Catepte, Mt. Ojas Del Salado, Mt. Okmok etc.
● Mid-Continental Belt (Volcanic zones of convergent continental plate
Margins). It includes volcanoes of Alpine mountain chain, the Mediterranean sea
and the fault zone of Eastern Africa of Stromboli, Vesuvius, Etna, Kilimanjaro etc.
● Mid-Atlantic Belt, in which the volcanoes are fissure eruption type, e.g. Iceland,
Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Azores etc.

Rocks
● An aggregate of one or more minerals
found on the surface of Earth is known as
Rock.
● Rocks may be hard, soft and varied in
colours.
● Various Minerals are obtained from rocks.
Rocks are classified in three main types
depending on the process of their formation
(i) Igneous (ii) Sedimentary
(iii) Metamorphic
Igneous Rocks
● Formed due to the cooling, solidification
and crystallisation of hot and molten
magma.
● They are known as the primary rocks as
all the other rocks are formed directly or
indirectly from the igneous rocks.
● It is believed that the igneous rocks are
formed during each period of geological
history of Earth.
● They are hard, granular and crystalline
rocks, less affected by chemical
weathering.
● Moreover, it does not have any fossil or
does not form any strata or layers of lava.
CLASSIFICATION OF
IGNEOUS ROCKS
On the basis of Mode of Occurrence
● Intrusive Rocks They are formed due to
the solidification of rising magma below
the surface of the Earth, e.g. Granite,
Lapolith, Batholiths, Sills etc
● Extrusive Rocks They are formed
due to cooling and solidification of hot
and molten magma at the Earth
surface, e.g. Basalt, Gabbro etc.
On the basis of Silica Content
● Acidic : It has more silica content e.g.
Granite.
● Basic : It has less amount of silica
content e.g. Gabbro.
Sedimentary Rocks
● The word ‘Sedimentary’ is derived from
the Latin word sedimentum, which
means settling.
● It is formed due to the aggregation and
compaction of sediments derived from
the older rocks or dead remains of
plants, animals and contains fossils of
plants.
● The sedimentary rocks can be
classified on the basis of the nature of
sediments : mechanically, chemically
and organically formed rocks.

● These are the rocks, which change
either in form or composition without
disintegration.
● Already formed igneous, sedimentary
or even metamorphic rocks are
changed to other forms and this
process is called metamorphosis.
● The agents of metamorphism are heat,
compression and solution.

Mountains
Based on their mode of formation four main
types of mountain can be distinguished.
Fold Mountains
● It is formed due to the face to face
orogenetic movements generated by
endogenetic forces.
● Example of fold moutains : Himalayas,
Alps, Andes, Rockies, Atlas etc.
On the basis of age, fold mountains are
grouped into
(a) Young/New Fold Mountains It came
into existence after the continental
drift and plate movements. e.g.
Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alps.
Himalayas are regarded as the
youngest mountains in the world.
(b) Old Fold Mountains They were
once young fold mountains. But
now, they have denuded due to
erosional processes.
e.g. Pennines (Europe), Appalachians
(US), Aravallis (India) etc.
Block Mountains
● It is formed when great block of Earth’s
crust may be raised or lowered due to
tectonic activities.
● The land between the two paralled
faults either rises forming Block
mountains or horsts or it subsides into a
depression termed as Rift valley or
Graben.
● Example of Block mountain : Vindhyan
and Satpura in India, the Vosges in France
and Black forest in Germany (through
which Rhine river flows).
Volcanic Mountains
● They are formed due to the accumulation
of volcanic material.
● They are also called Mountains of
Accumulation.
● Examples : Mt Fuji (Japan), Cotopaxi in
Andes, Vesuvius and Etna in Italy, Mt
Mayon (Philippines) etc.
Residual or Dissected Mountains
● They are formed as a result of erosion of
plateaus and high planes by various
agents of erosion.
● Examples : Catskill mountains of New
York, Sierras of Central Spain, Highlands
of Scotland, Parasnath, Girnar, Deccan
Plateau and Rajmahal of India.

According to their mode of formation and
their physical appearance, plateaus may
be grouped into the following types:
Tectonic Plateau These are formed by
Earth movements which cause uplift.
They are normally of a considerable size
and fairly uniform altitude.
● Examples of Tectonic Plateau are:
Tibetan Plateau between the
Himalayas and the Kunlun and the
Bolivian Plateau between two ranges of
the Andes.
● When plateau are enclosed by Fold
moutains, they are known as
Intermont Plateau. e.g. Bolivian
Plateau.
Volcanic Plateau These are formed by
accumulation of lava. e.g. North-Western
part of Deccan Plateau (India).
Dissected Plateau Through the continual
process of weathering and erosion by
running water, ice and winds, high extensive
plateau are gradually worn down, and their
surface becomes irregular. For example, the
Scottish Highlands.
Plains
● A relatively low-lying and flat land surface
with the least difference between its
highest and lowest points is called a Plain.
● The plains are divided into structural,
erosional and depositional plains.
Classification of Plains
Structural
Plain
Erosional Plain Depositional
Plain
Formed
due to the
uplift of a
part of the
sea floor
e.g. the
Great Plain
of USA.
Formed when the
elevated tract of
land is worn down
to a plain by the
process of
erosion. e.g. Plain
of North Canada.
Formed by
filling up of
sediments into
depressions
along the
foothills, lakes
and seas e.g.
Indo Ganga
Plain.
ATMOSPHERE
Atmosphere is a thick gaseous envelope
surrounding the Earth from all sides and
attached to the Earth through the force of
gravity.
Significance of Atmosphere
● Acts as a filter because it absorbs the
harmful Ultraviolet radiation.
● Source of various life supporting gases
such as oxygen, carbon dioxide etc.
● Supports life forms in biosphere.
Extent of Atmosphere
● Though the exact attitude of atmosphere
is not known, but it is estimated that it
extends till 10,000 km above the Earth’s
surface.
● The vertical distribution of atmospheric
layers is not uniform.
● Almost 98% of atmospheric mass is
limited to an altitude of 30 km from the
surface of Earth.
144 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Composition of Atmosphere
● The atmosphere is composed of gases, water vapour and particulates.
● Gases such as Helium, Ozone and Hydrogen etc are present in traces.
● Ozone gas absorbs the ultraviolet radiations and protects the biosphere from its
adverse impact.
Layers of Atmosphere
Troposphere
● It extends upto an average altitude of 18
km from the Earth’s surface. Thickness
varies from 8 km at the poles to 18 km at
the equator.
● At every 165 m, there is a drop of 1° C (or
6 4. ° C per km). This is called Normal
Lapse Rate of Temperature.
● Tropopause separates troposphere from
stratosphere.
● This layer accounts for practically the
entire water vapour, all dust particles and
most of the Carbon dioxide contained in
the atmosphere. Due to this all weather
phenomena such as condensation,
precipitation and storms etc occur in the
troposphere only.
Stratosphere
● The stratosphere extends up to about 50
km, where stratopause separates it from
the mesosphere.
● In this layer, the temperature increases
with increase in height. This phenomenon
is known as temperature inversion.
● The temperature rises in this layer from
about–60°C at the tropopause to 0°C at
stratopause.
● The part of the stratosphere, in which there
is a concentration of ozone is often called
ozonosphere. It absorbs ultraviolet
radiation, which is harmful for life forms in
the biosphere.
● Stratosphere is free from dust
particles and also from atmospheric
turbulence. Hence, this layer is
considered ideal for flying of jet
aircrafts.
Mesosphere
● Mesosphere extends above the
stratopause up to a height of about 80
km.
● In this layer, the temperature
decreases with height like in the
troposphere and it falls from about
0° C at its base to about – 100° C at an
height of 80 km. It is considered the
coldest layer of the atmosphere.
● The upper limit of the mesosphere is
marked by the Mesopause, a
transitional layer separating it from
the ionosphere.
● Meteoroids burn in this layer which
prevents them from colliding with the
Earth’s surface.
Ionosphere
● Ionosphere is located above the
mesosphere and extends up to about
600 km. This layer is called
ionosphere because it contains
electrically charged ions that reflect
the radio waves back to the Earth
which makes radio communication
possible. Absorption of solar radiation
by ionised particles causes an increase
in temperature with increasing height
in the ionosphere.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 145
The percentage composition of the various gases in atmosphere upto 50 km is given below:
Gases Percentage Composition Significance
Nitrogen 78.08% Acts as dilutent and is generally chemically inactive.
Oxygen 21% Inhaled by biotic components for survival. Oxygen is
also essential for combustion of burning matter.
Argon 0.93% Inert gas.
Carbon
dioxide
0.03% Being a greenhouse gas, it maintains the
temperature of the lower atmosphere.
Neon 0.0018% Inert gas
Helium 0.0005% Inert gas
Thermosphere
● The zone between the 85 km and 600 km above the surface is often called
Thermosphere. In this layer, the temperature increases with increasing altitude. The
upper limit of the thermosphere, the thermopause is generally taken at an altitude of
about 600 km.
● The day temperature at 600 km altitude exceed 1400° C while night temperature
remain about 225° C .
● The upper part of the thermosphere contains only the lighter gases like helium and
hydrogen.
Exosphere and Magnetosphere
● The outermost part of the atmosphere of the Earth is called Exosphere.
● This zone of the atmosphere is about 10,000 km thick.
● The upper limit of the exosphere is uncertain as this layer acts as a transitional layer
between the Earth’s atmosphere and the outer space. The outer part of the exosphere
is called Magnetosphere.
Chemical Composition of the Atmosphere
On the basis of chemical composition, the atmosphere is divided into
● Homosphere The atmosphere upto 80 km altitude is known as homosphere. There is
a homogeneous composition of various gases like nitrogen, oxygen, argon, CO2
etc. in
the Homosphere. Due to growing industrialisation, the homogeneity of this layer has
been disturbed.
● Heterosphere This layer starts from 80 km and coincides with the thermosphere.
There are distinct layers of gases in the atmosphere, which are arranged according to
their mean molecular weights. Four distinct layers of gases are formed – N2
, O, He, H.

Insolation
● Solar radiation that is intercepted by
the Earth is known as Insolation.
¡ Insolation is measured with the help of
Pyranometers.
The amount of insolation depends on
following factors:
(i) The area and nature of the surface.
(ii) The inclination of the rays of the Sun.
(iii) Distance between the Earth and the
Sun.
(iv) Length of the day.
(v) The transparency of the atmosphere.
● As the angle of the Sun’s rays decreases
poleward, the amount of insolation
received also decreases in that direction.
● The Earth’s surface does not absorb all
the energy that it receives. The
proportion of the solar radiation
reflected back from the surface is called
Albedo.
● On an average, insolation is highest
near the equator, marginally lower at
the tropics and lowest at the poles.
Heat Budget of the Earth
● The Earth receives energy continuously
from the Sun but its temperature is still
almost constant. This is because the
atmosphere loses an amount of heat
equal to the amount of heat gain
through insolation. This mechanism of
maintaining the balance between
incoming and outgoing heat in the
atmosphere is called the Heat Budget
or Heat Balance.
● Let us assume that 100 units of energy
reach the top of the atmosphere of the
Earth. 14 units are absorbed directly
by the atmosphere and 35 units are lost
to space through reflection.
● The remaining 51 units reach the Earth’s
surface and are absorbed by the Earth
due to which the surface gets heated.
● The heated surface of the Earth starts
radiating energy in the form of long waves
and this process is called Terrestrial
Radiation.
● Out of the total 51 units given up by the
surface in the form of terrestrial
radiation, the atmosphere (mainly CO2
and water vapour) absorbs about 34
units and the remaining 17 units escape
to space.
● In this way, the atmosphere receives a
total of 14 + 34 = 48 units and this
amount is radiated back to space by the
atmosphere.
● The total loss of energy to space thus
amounts to 100 units. 35 units reflected
by the atmosphere, 17 units lost as
terrestrial radiation and 48 units from the
atmosphere.
● In this way, no net gain or loss of energy
occurs on the Earth’s surface.
● At equator, the amount of incoming
radiation is more than outgoing radiation,
whereas the amount of outgoing
radiation is more than incoming
radiation in polor regions. The transport
of surplus heat from equator to poles is
known as ‘Meridional Transport of Heat’.
Atmospheric Pressure
● Air is a mixture of several gases having
their own weight. The pressure exerted
by air due to its weight is called
atmospheric pressure on the Earth’s
surface.
● Atmospheric pressure is neither the same
for all the regions nor the same for one
region all the time.
● Atmospheric pressure is affected by
various factors such as altitude,
temperature and Earth’s rotation.
Influence on the
Atmospheric Pressure
Altitude Air pressure increases, when air
descends. This is due to the decrease in
volume of the air. When air raises its
volume increases and the pressure of its
molecules is spread over a larger area so, its
pressure decreases.
148 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Temperature The pressure of air rises, when its temperature falls. Low temperature at
the poles cause the air to contract–high pressure develops; whereas the high temperature
along the equator cause the air to expand–low pressure develops.
THE GLOBAL PRESSURE BELTS
Equatorial Low Pressure Belt
● It is located on either side of the
geographical equator in a zone extending
between 5°N and 5°S. Its location is not
stationary and there is a seasonal drift of
this belt with the Northward (summer
solstice) and Southward (winter solstice)
migration of the Sun.
● It is thermally induced because of the
intense heating of the ground surface by the
almost vertical Sun rays.
● It represents the zone of convergence of
North-East and South-East trade winds.
This convergence zone is characterised by
light and feeble winds. And because of the
frequent calm conditions, this belt is known
as a belt of calm or doldrums.
Subtropical High Pressure Belt
● It extends between 30° to 35° latitudes in
both the hemispheres.
● It is not thermally induced, but dynamically
induced as it is formed by the rotation of the
Earth and sinking and settling down of
winds.
● Here the convergence of winds at
higher altitude above this zone results
in the subsidence of air. Subsidence
results in concentration of their
volume and ultimately causes high
pressure in this zone.
● This zone of high pressure is also
called Horse Latitude.
Sub-Polar Low Pressure
Belt
● It extends between 60° to 65°
latitudes in both the hemisphere.
● The low pressure belt does not appear
to be thermally induced because
there is low temperature throughout
the year. Naturally, there should have
been high pressure belt instead of low
pressure belt. But as it is dynamically
induced low pressure is formed.
● It is more developed and regular in
Southern hemisphere than in
Northern hemisphere because of the
over dominance of water (ocean) in
the Southern hemisphere.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 149
Polar High Pressure Belt
● High pressure persists at the poles throughout
the year because of the prevalence of very low
temperature all the year round.
● Thus, it is thermally induced pressure belt.
Shifting of Wind Belts
● The entire system of pressure and wind belts
follows the movement of midday Sun. In June,
when the Sun is over the Tropic of Cancer, all
the belts move about 5 10 °− ° North of their
average position.
● In the same manner, when the Sun is overhead
at the Tropic of Capricorn in December, all the
belts shift 5 10 ° − ° South of their average
position.
Wind System
● The pressure difference is the major cause of
the genesis of the wind system. The air
moves from high pressure to low pressure.
● The slope of pressure from high to low is called
as pressure gradient, which is also called as
barometric slope.
● The imaginary line joining the points having
same pressure is called isobars. Ideally, the
direction of air movement should be
perpendicular to the isobars but the winds are
deflected due to the Coriolis force caused by
the rotation of the Earth.
Wind Direction
and Related Laws
● The Coriolis force generated due to the
rotation of Earth acts as a deflective force to
the wind direction. Because of the Coriolis
force, all the winds are deflected to the right in
the Northern hemisphere while they are
deflected to the left in the
Southern hemisphere with
respect to the rotating Earth.
● This is referred to as Ferrel’s Law.
The Coriolis force is absent along
the equator, but increases
progressively towards the pole.
● The factors that control the air
motion on Earth’s surface are as
follows:
¡ Pressure gradient
¡ Rotation of Earth and Coriolis
force
¡ Frictional force
¡ Centrifugal action of wind
● The winds blowing parallel to the
isobars generally at the height of
600 m is called geostrophic wind.
Primary Wind Movement
(Permanent Winds)
These winds include trade wind,
westerlies and polar winds.
Trade Winds
● These are steady currents of air
blowing from the sub-tropical high
pressure belt towards the
equatorial low pressure belt.
● Under the influence of the Coriolis
forces they flow from the
North-East in the Northern
hemisphere and from South-East
in the Southern hemisphere.
Westerlies
● The permanent winds blowing
from the sub-tropical high
pressure belt to the sub-polar low
pressure belt in both the
hemisphere is called Westerlies.
● The general direction of the
westerlies is South-West to NorthEast in the Northern hemisphere
and North-West to South-East in
the Southern hemisphere.
● Because of the dominance of the
land masses in the Northern
hemisphere the Westerlies become
more complex and complicated.
They become less effective during
summer seasons and more
vigorous during winter seasons.

150 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
The Westerlies become more rigorous in the Southern hemisphere because of the lack
of land and dominance of water surface.
● Their velocity increases Southward and they become stormy so they are called roaring
forties between 40°-50° South latitudes, furious fifties at 50° South latitude and
screaming sixties at 60° South latitude.
Polar Winds
Polar winds blows from polar high pressure belt to sub-polar low pressure belt. They are
North-Easterly in Northern hemisphere and South-Easterly in the Southern hemisphere.
Secondary Wind Movement
Secondary wind movements include those wind patterns that are not permanent like the
primary winds. Secondary Wind Movement includes seasonal periodic winds. Seasonal
winds are the winds, which reverse their direction completely every 6 months with
change in season. The best example is Monsoon winds.
CYCLONES
Cyclones are the centres of low pressure surrounded by closed isobars having increasing
pressure outwards due to low pressure at the centre, there is continuous flow of air
towards the centre.
● Air blows inward in anti-clockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere.
● Air blows inward in clockwise direction in the Southern hemisphere.
Cyclones are mainly of two types
(i) Tropical Cyclone (ii) Temperate Cyclone

Differences Between Tropical and
Temperate Cyclones
Tropical Cyclone Temperate Cyclone
They are found in the
trade wind belt,
between 8-20 degree
North and South. But
not found between 0 to
8 degree as there is no
coriolis force there.
Normally found
between 30 to 65
degree North and
South in the sub-polar
frontal zone, where
cold polar air mass
meets the warm
tropical air mass.
It travels from East to
West in the Easterly
wind belt.
It moves from West to
East embedded in the
Westerly wind belt.
Tropical cyclones are
much smaller with a
diameter of about 200
to 500 km.
They form over a
much large area with
a diameter 300 to
1500 km.
Tropical cyclones are
non frontal in nature.
Temperate cyclones
are frontal in nature.
It is formed only over
the oceans.
It is formed either
over con- tinents or
over the oceans.
Tropical cyclone can
form only in the summer.
They can form both in
summer as well as in
winter.
It does not have
definite lifecycle and
they dissipate as they
pass over the land
surface.
It takes more time to
dissipate as it has a
more definite
lifecycle.
Anticyclone
● They are the wind systems, which have
the highest air pressure at the centre
and lowest at the outer margins.
¡ The wind blows from the centre to
outward in clockwise direction in
Northern hemisphere and from centre to
outward in anti-clockwise direction in
Southern hemisphere.
● They are high pressure system and
common in sub-tropical belts and
practically absent in the equatorial
region.
● They are generally associated with
rainless fair weather and that’s why they
are known as weatherless phenomena.
Thunderstorms
● Thunderstorms are local storms
characterised by swift upward
movement of air and heavy rainfall with
cloud thunder and lightening.
● Structurally, thunderstorms consist of
several convective cells, which are
characterised by strong updraft of air.
Tornado
● Tornadoes are very strong tropical
cyclones of smaller size. In the
Mississippi valley (US), they are called
Twisters.
● They are more destructive than cyclones
as the speed of winds is very high,
exceeding 220 km per hour.
Jet Stream
● The strong and rapidly moving
circumpolar Westerly air circulation in a
narrow belt of a few hundred kilometres
width in the upper limit of troposphere
is called Jet Stream.
● Their circulation path is wavy and
meandering.
● The extent of the Jet Streams narrows
down during the summer season
because of their Northward shifting
while these extend up to 20° North
latitude during winter season.
HUMIDITY
● Humidity of air refers to the content of
the water vapour present in the air at a
particular time and place. Humidity is
measured by an instrument called
hygrometer. Another instrument used
for the same purpose is sling
psychrometer.
The atmospheric humidity is expressed in a
number of ways such as:
Way of Measurement
of Humidity
Definition
Humidity Capacity The capacity of air
of certain volume at
certain temperature
to retain maximum
amount of moisture
content.
Absolute Humidity The total weight of
moisture content
per volume of air at
definite
temperature is
called absolute
humidity.
Specific Humidity The mass of the
water vapour in
grams contained in
a kilogram of air. It
represents the
actual quantity of
moisture present in
a definite amount
of air.
Relative Humidity
Relative Humidity
= ×
Absolute humidity
Humidity capacity
100
It is the ratio of the
amount of water
vapour actually
present in the air
having definite
volume and
temperature (i.e.
absolute humidity)
to the maximum
amount the air can
hold (i.e. humidity
capacity).
Condensation and Its Forms
● When the relative humidity reaches
100%, the air is completely saturated. The
air temperature is said to be at dew-point.
● It is the change of physical state of matter
from gaseous phase into liquid phase and
is the reverse of vaporisation. The
process of condensation depends upon
the amount of Relative Humidity present
in the air.
● Smog (Smoke + Fog) is a form of fog that
occurs in areas, where the air contains a
large amount of smoke.
● Fog is made from the droplets of water
suspended in the lower layer of the
atmosphere. Fog is not considered as a
form of precipitaion. Visibility of less
than 1 km is the internationally
recognised definition of fog.
● Haze is formed by water particles that
have condensed in the atmosphere and
visibility lie between 1 km to 2 km.
● Frost is the moisture on the ground
surface that condenses directly into ice,
i.e. when condensation occurs below
freezing point.
RAINFALL
On the basis of its origin, Rainfall may be
classified into three main types
● Convectional Rainfall It occurs due to
thermal convection currents caused
due to insolational heating of ground
surface.
● Orographic Rainfall occurs due to
ascent of air forced by a mountain
barrier.
● Frontal Rainfall or Cyclonic It occurs
due to upward movement of air caused
by convergence of cold air masses
against warm air masses.

when two extensive air
masses of different physical
properties converge.
n In temperate regions, two
extensive air masses of
similar physical properties
converge to form temperate
cyclones that cause heavy
rainfall in these regions.
Clouds
● Clouds are the masses of small water droplets or tiny ice crystals.
● Clouds are classified according to their appearance, form and height.
There are four groups
(i) High Clouds 6 to 20 km
(ii) Middle Clouds 2.5 to 6 km
(iii) Low Clouds below 2.5 km
(iv) Clouds of great vertical extent upto 9000 m
The different types of clouds are given Latin names, which are the combination of the
following words:
¡ Cirrus means looking like a feather and used to describe the very high clouds.
¡ Cumulus means looking like a heap. It is used to describe the clouds having flat bases
and rounded tops.
¡ Stratus means lying in level sheets. It is used for layer type of clouds.
¡ Alto means at middle altitudes.
¡ Nimbus means rain cloud.

Climate and Weather
Weather refers to the sum total of all the atmospheric conditions in terms of
temperatures, pressures, wind, moisture, cloudiness, rainfall etc of a particular place at
any given time. The climate of a place is defined as an aggregate weather conditions over
a considerably long period of time.

There are four oceans. In the order of their
size they are: Pacific ocean, Atlantic ocean,
Indian ocean and Arctic ocean. The average
depth of oceans on Earth is about 4 km.
Major Oceans
Ocean Important Information
Pacific It is the largest and deepest of ocean.
Most of the Islands of the ocean are of
volcanic or coral origin. Mariana
Trench, the world’s deepest trench with
depth 11033 km is in Pacific ocean.
Atlantic It has the longest coast line. It is the
busiest ocean for trade and commerce
since its sea routes connect the two
most industrialised regions, namely
Western Europe and North-Eastern
United States of America. Atlantic ocean
is still widening. Puerto Rico Trench is
the deepest point of this ocean.
Indian Only ocean named after a country. It is
deeper than the Atlantic ocean. Here
the number of continental islands is
more than that of volcanic islands.
Sunda Trench (earlier known as Java
Trench) is the deepest point of this
ocean.
Arctic It is the smallest ocean and lies within
the Arctic circle. The North pole lies in
the middle of the Arctic ocean. Most of
the part of the ocean is frozen and
hence it is least saline and the
shallowest among all the oceans.
Nansei Trench is the deepest point of
this ocean.
158 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
Relief of the Ocean Basin
Continental Shelf
● The shallow submerged extension of the
continent is called the continental shelf.
● Extends to a depth of 100 fathoms
(1 fathoms = 18. m).
● Average width 70 km; average slope of
about 1°.
● Continental shelf covers 8.6% of total
area of the oceans. It extends over 13.3%
of the Atlantic ocean 5.7% of Pacific
ocean and 4.2% of Indian ocean.
● If mountains extend along the coast, the
shelf will be narrower.
● About 20% of oil and gas are found here.
They also provide the richest fishing
grounds in the world.
Continental Slope
● Extends seawards from the continental
shelf.
● Depth-200-2000 metres.
● Average slope is 2 to 5 degrees.
● The boundary between shelf and slope is
known as shelf break, which is a seaward
edge with an abrupt drop.
● They cover about 8.5% of the total ocean
area.
Continental Rise
● Continental rise is an area at the foot of
the slope, slightly rising due to the
accumulation of debris transported over
the slope.
● Average slope-0.5° to 1°.
● Oil deposits occur here.
Abyssal or the Deep
Sea Plains
● It is an underwater vast and flat plain on
the oceanic floor.
● Average depth 3000 m to 6000 m.
● It covers about 40% of total oceanic area.
● Parts of the Abyssal plains are occupied
by raised ridges or submarine mountains
and by very deep trenches or canyons.
Deeps/Trenches
● Trenches are narrow and steep side
depressions. Trenches are formed, when
one plate of Earth’s crust is subducted
below the other.
● Mariana trench (Challenger deep) is the
deepest point in the world situated in the
NW Pacific ocean, near Philippines. It is
more than 11 km deep.
Oceanic Ridges
● Oceanic Ridges are formed by the
volcanic activity along the divergent
boundary of plates.
● It is a thousand km long and hundreds of
km wide mountain range on the oceanic
floor.
● Their summits may rise above the sea
level in the form of Islands i.e. Azores
Island of Iceland.

Sea Mounts and Guyouts
● A ridge rising more than 1000 m
above the ocean floor is called
seamount. Flat topped sea mounts
are called Guyouts.
● Both of them are formed by the
volcanic activity.
● Largest number of sea mounts and
Guyouts are found in the Pacific
ocean.
Submarine Canyons
● Submarine canyons are the deep
gorges on the ocean floor and are
restricted to the continental
shelves, slopes and rises.
● Many submarine canyons are
found along the mouths of major
rivers e.g. Hudson canyon.
CORAL REEFS
● Coral reefs are formed due to
accumulation and the compaction
of skeletons of lime secreting
organisms known as Coral Polyps.
● Corals are found mainly in the
tropical oceans and seas because
they require high mean annual
temperature ranging between 20°C
to 25°C.
● Corals do not live in deeper waters
due to lack of sufficient sunlight
and oxygen.
On the basis of nature, shape and
mode of occurrence, the coral reefs are
classified into four types:
Fringing Reefs
● It develops along the continental
margins or along the islands.
● The seaward slope is steep and
vertical while the landward slope is
gentle.
● They are usually attached to the
coastal land, but occasionally they
are separated from the shore by a
shallow and narrow lagoon called
Boat Channel.
● These type of reefs are found near
Rameshwaram in the Gulf of
Mannar and Andamans.
Barrier Reefs
● The barrier reef lies at a distance away from
the coast. Hence, a broad lagoon separates the
reef and the shore.
● The Great Barrier Reef of Australia is the
largest barrier reef in the world. In India, it is
found in Nicobar and Lakshadweep.
Patch Reefs
● Patch reefs are isolated and discontinuous
patches lying shoreward of offshore reef
structures. These are found in the Palk Bay,
Gulf of Mannar and Gulf of Kutch.
Atoll
● A reef of narrow growing corals of horse shoe
shape and crowned with palm trees is called an
atoll.
● It is formed around an island or in an elliptical
form on a submarine platform.
● Funafuti atoll of Ellice Islands is a famous
atoll. They are also found in Lakshadweep and
Nicobar.
Coral Bleaching
When corals are stressed by changes in conditions
such as temperature, light or nutrients, they expel the
symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them
to turn completely white, this phenomenon is known
as coral bleaching.
SALINITY
● Salinity is defined as the total amount of salt
content in grams contained in 1 kg of sea
water and is expressed as part per
thousand. The oceanic salinity not only affects
the marine organism and plant community,
but also affects the physical properties of the
ocean such as temperature, pressure, density,
waves and currents.
● Average salinity in Southern hemisphere is
more than that of Northern hemisphere.
● Iso-halines represent the salinity distribution
in the surface of the sea. These are the lines
joining places having an equal degree of
salinity. The main source of salinity is
dissolution of the rocks of oceanic crust, which
contain various salts.
● Poles have minimum salinity because of
addition of fresh water in the form of icebergs
and excessive snowfall.
160 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● Variation in salinity causes
vertical circulation of water.
More saline water freezes slowly
while the boiling point of saline
water is higher than the fresh
water.
● Salinity also increases the
density of water.

Salinity on an average decreases
from equator to poles. The
highest salinity is recorded near
the tropics rather than the
equator because of the heavy
precipitation in the equatorial
region.
Factors Controlling
Oceanic Salinity
The salinity of oceans and
different seas depends on a
number of factors such as
evaporation, precipitation, influx
of the river water, prevailing wind,
ocean currents and sea waves etc.
Controlling
Factor
Relation with Salinity
Evaporation Greater the evaporation, higher the
salinity.
Precipitation Higher the precipitation, lower the salinity.
Influx of river
water
Big voluminuous rivers pour down
immense volume of fresh water into the
oceans and salinity is reduced at the
mouth.
Atmospheric
pressure
Anticyclonic conditions with stable air and
high temperature increases the salinity of
the surface water of the ocean.
Circulation
of oceanic
water
Ocean currents affect the spatial distribution
of salinity by mixing sea waters.
MOVEMENTS OF OCEANIC
WATER
Waves
● Waves are the oscillatory movements in water
mainly produced by winds, manifested by an
alternate rise and fall of the sea surface.
● The waves are the important agents of erosion in
the coastal regions, where they carve out various
landforms like caves, bays, gulfs, capes and cliffs.
● Seismic waves or Tsunamis are the waves caused
by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions at the sea
bottom.
● The Tsunamis, which hit the coast in South-East
Asia on 26th December, 2004, caused very heavy
damage in that region.
● Tsunamis in the Indonesian Islands of Sulawesi,
Java and Sumatra in 2018 killed many and injured
a large number of people.
Ocean Currents
● An ocean current is a continuous, directed
movement of ocean water generated by the forces
acting upon it, such as breaking waves, wind,
coriolis effect, temperature and salinity
differences and tides caused by the gravitation
pull of the Moon and the Sun.
● Ocean currents circulate in clockwise direction in
Northern hemisphere and in anti-clockwise
direction in Southern hemisphere.
Ocean currents are of two types:
(i) Warm Currents The ocean currents flowing
from lower latitude to higher latitude are
known as warm currents.
(ii) Cold Currents The ocean currents flowing
from higher latitude to lower latitude are
known as cold currents.

TIDES
● The periodic rise and fall of the sea level as a result of the gravitational forces between
the Earth, the Moon and the Sun is called a tide. The time interval between two tides
is 12 hours and 26 minutes.
Spring Tides
● When the Earth, the Moon and the Sun are in a straight line (SYZYGY) the Sun
assists the gravitational pull of the Moon, creating a condition of higher high tides and
lower low tides known as spring tides.
Neap Tides
● When the Sun and Moon are at right angles to the Earth (Quadrature), the Sun
partially reduces the gravitational pull of the Moon, producing lower high tides known
as a Neap tide.

INDIAN GEOGRAPHY
PHYSICAL FEATURES
Physiographic divisions of India are as follows:
● The Himalayan Range of Mountains
● The Peninsular Plateau
● The Great Plains of India
● The Coastal Plains
● The Islands of India
The Himalayas
● Himalayas means ‘Abode of snow’. These
are young fold mountains of tertiary period,
which were folded over Tethys sea due to
inter-continental collision.
● They are one of the youngest fold mountain
ranges in the world and comprises mainly
sedimentary rocks.
● They stretch from the Indus river in
the West to the Brahmaputra river in
the East.
● The Pamirs, popularly known as the
Roof of the World is the connecting
link between the Himalayas and the
high ranges of Central Asia.
● The total length is about 2500 km
with varying width of 240 to 400 km
and a total area of 595000 km2
.
They consists of three parallel ranges
such as:
(i) Himadri (Greater Himalayas)
(ii) Himachal (Lesser Himalayas)
(iii) Shiwaliks (Outer Himalayas)

Himalayan Rivers
Himalayan rivers are divided into three
major river systems:
The Indus System
● The Indus, also known as Sindhu, is
the Western most of Himalayan rivers
in India.
● It is one of the largest river basins of
the world covering an area of
1178440 sq km (in India it is 321284
sq km) and a total length of 2880 km
(in India 709 km).
● It originates from a glacier near
Bokhar Chu in the Tibetan region
near Mansarovar lake.
● In Tibet, it is known as Singi
Khamban or Lion’s mouth.
● In Jammu and Kashmir, its
Himalayan tributaries are Zanskar,
Dras, Gortang, Shyok, Shigar, Nubra,
Gilgit etc.
● Its most important tributaries,
which join Indus at various places,
are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and
Sutlej.
● According to Indus Water Treaty
signed between India and Pakistan in
1960, India can utilise only 20% of
the total discharge of Indus, Jhelum
and Chenab.

Prayag, the Bhagirathi, meets the
Alaknanda, hereafter, it is known as the
Ganga. The Alaknanda has its source in the
Satopanth glacier above Badrinath.
● The Alaknanda consists of the Dhauli and
the Vishnu Ganga, which meet at Joshimath
or Vishnu Prayag.
● The other tributaries of Alaknanda such as
the Pindar joins it at Karna Prayag, while
Mandakini or Kali Ganga meets it at Rudra
Prayag.

Excess deposition of silt and soil forms a delta. Tidal waves remove the silt out and an estuary
is formed.
It is more fertile land. They provide critical habitats for many fish
species.
Differences Between Himalayan River System and Peninsular System
Himalayan Rivers Peninsular Rivers
They have large basins and catchment areas. They have small basins and catchment areas.
They are the example of antecedent drainage. They are the example of consequent drainage.
They are perennial in nature, i.e. the water
flows throughout the year.
They are seasonal in nature and receive water
mainly from rainfall.
These rivers are still in their youthful stage. These rivers have already reached their maturity
stage.
These rivers form meanders. There is little scope for meander formation.

THE CLIMATE OF
INDIA
● India has tropical monsoon type
of climate. It is greatly
influenced by the presence of
Himalayas in the North as they
block the cold air masses from
Central Asia. It is because of the
Himalayas that the monsoon
winds shed their water in India.
● The Tropic of Cancer (23.5°N)
divides India into two almost
equal climatic zones, namely,
the Northern zone (sub-tropical)
and the Southern zone (tropical).
● The sub-tropical climate of the
Northern zone gives it cold
winter season and hot summer
season.
● The Southern tropical climate
zone is warmer than the North
and does not have a clear cut
winter season.
The Southern zone has the
midday Sun almost vertically
overhead at least twice every year
and the Northern zone does not
have the midday Sun vertically
overhead during any part of the
year.
Factors Influencing
the Climate of India
The factors influencing the climate of India are as
follows:
● Location and Latitudinal extent The Tropic of
Cancer passes through the middle of the country.
The region to the South of Tropic of Cancer
experiences tropical climate, whereas the region
to the North of the Tropic of Cancer experiences
warm temperate climate.
● Distance from Sea The areas near to the sea
experience maritime climate, whereas the areas
away from the sea experience continental
climate.
● The Northern Mountain Range The Northern
Himalayan range protects India from the bitterly
cold and dry winds of Central Asia during winter.
Moreover, it acts as a physical barrier for the rain
bearing South-West monsoon.
● Physiography The physiography has great
impact on the major elements of climate such as
temperature, atmospheric pressure, direction of
wind and amount of rainfall.
● Monsoon Wind It is the most dominating factor
of Indian climate. The South-West summer
monsoon from the Arabian sea and the Bay of
Bengal bring rainfall to the entire country.
Besides the North-East winter monsoon
travelling from land to sea causes rainfall along
the Coromandel coast after acquiring moisture
from the Bay of Bengal.

Western Disturbances
These are the depressions generated over the
Mediterranean sea and enter India after
crossing over Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and
Pakistan under the influence of Westerly jet
stream. After reaching India, they move
Eastwards, causing light rain in the
Indo-Gangetic plains and snowfall in Himalayan
belt.
● Upper Air Circulation The upper air
circulation of India is dominated by a
westerly flow. An important component of
this flow is the Jet Stream. The Western
cyclonic disturbances experienced in
North and North Western parts of the
country are brought in by this Westerly
flow.
● Tropical Cyclones The tropical cyclones
generated in Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal
during the South-West monsoon and the
retreating monsoon seasons influence the
weather conditions of the Peninsular India.
● El Nino and La Nina El Nino is a narrow
warm current, which occasionally appears
off the coast of Peru in December by
temporarily replacing the cold Peru current.
● The warming of tropical Pacific waters
affect the global pattern of pressure and
wind systems including the monsoon
winds in the Indian ocean. La Nina is
the reverse of El-Nino. It is a harbinger
of heavy monsoon showers in India.
● Southern Oscillation Whenever the
surface level pressure is high over the
Indian ocean, there is low pressure over
the Pacific ocean and vice versa. This
inter-relation of high and low pressure
over the Pacific and the Indian ocean is
called Southern Oscillation.
Seasons in India
● Indian climate is characterised by
distinct seasonality. Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD) has
recognised the following four distinct
seasons:
(i) The cold season or winter season.
(ii) The hot weather season or
summer season.
(iii) The South-West monsoon season
or rainy season.
(iv) The season of the retreating
monsoon or cool season.

Climatic Regions of India
Trewartha’s Classification
● Dr Trewartha’s scheme has been most prominent of all classifications of the Indian
climatic regions. He presented a modified form of Koppen’s classification.
● Dr Trewartha’s classification divides India into four major regions of the A, B, C and H
types. The A type refers to tropical rainy climate, where high temperatures are
consistent. The B type stands for a dry climate with high temperatures, but little
rainfall. The C type indicates a region with dry winters, where there is low temperature
range between 0°C and 18°C. The H type indicates a mountain climate. The A, B, and
C types are further sub-divided.
Annual Rainfall

AGRICULTURE IN
INDIA
India is essentially an agricultural land.
Two-thirds of its population still lives on
agriculture. Agriculture is a primary activity
which includes farming, animal rearing and
fishing. There are three crop seasons in
India
(i) Kharif Sown in June/July, harvested in
September/October. e.g. rice, jowar,
bajra, ragi, maize, cotton and jute.
(ii) Rabi Sown in October/December,
harvested in April/May e.g. wheat,
barley, peas, rapeseed, mustard,
grains.
(iii) Zaid They are raised between April
and June e.g. melon, watermelon,
cuccumber, toris, leafy and other
vegetables.

ENERGY
● India is a fast growing country and
therefore the demand for energy is
also continuously growing. India is
exploiting almost all the sources of
energy such as hydroelectricity,
thermal energy, nuclear energy,
solar energy and wind energy etc.
● Power development commenced in
India with the commissioning of
Sidrapong hydel power station in
Darjeeling during 1897, followed by
a hydropower station at
Sivasamudram in Karnataka during
1902.
● Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya,
Nagaland, Sikkim and Uttarakhand
are largely dependent upon
hydroelectricity.
● National Hydro Power Corporation
(NHPC) was set-up in 1975, under
public sector for the generation of
hydropower in India.
● National Thermal Power
Corporation (NTPC) was set-up in
1975, for generation of thermal
energy. NTPC has 18 coal based
super thermal power projects and 7
gas/liquid based combined cycle
projects.
● Atomic Energy Institute at Trombay
was set-up in 1954 which was
renamed as Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre (BARC) in 1967.
● Heavy Water Plants are at Baroda,
Tuticorin, Kota, Thal, Hazira and
Manuguru. The first heavy water
plant was set-up in Nangal in 1962.
● The Renewable Energy Programme
started with the establishment of
the Department of
Non-Conventional Energy Sources
in 1982. Indian Renewable Energy
Development Agency was set-up in
1987. In 1992; DNES was
converted into Ministry of

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● Ecology is a science, in which study of
organism is undertaken in relation to
their environment. This science
developed in response to the increasing
awareness of inter- relationships
between plants, animals and their
physical habitats.
● The term ecosystem was first used by
AG Tansley in 1935, who defined
ecosystem as a particular category of
physical system, consisting of organisms
and inorganic components in a relatively
stable equilibrium which is open and of
various sizes and kinds.
Components of Ecosystem
● Abiotic Components are the non-living
components, e.g. air, water, soil,
suspended particulate matter etc.
● Biotic Components includes plants,
animals and micro-organism.
● The living organism in an ecosystem
can be divided into three categories
Producers
● Producers are organisms that can make
organic energy resources from abiotic
components of the environment. They
produce their food themselves.
Consumers
● Consumers are those organisms that
gather energy by consuming organic
material from other organisms. Primary
consumers are those organisms, who
consume mainly producers. Primary
consumers are also known as Herbivores.
● Secondary consumers are those
organisms, who consume mainly
primary consumers. Tertiary consumers
are organisms that consume secondary
consumers. Tertiary consumers are
carnivores. Omnivores feed on both
producers and other consumers.
● Detritovores consume detritus
(dead material of plants and animals).
Decomposers
● Decomposers are organisms that break
down dead or decaying organisms.
Decomposers are heterotrophic which
means that they use organic substrates to
get their energy and carbon and
nutrients for their growth and
development e.g. bacteria and fungi.
Functions of Ecosystem
The main functions of an ecosystem are as
follows:
(i) Materials or nutrient cycle
(ii) Biological or ecological regulation
● Foodchain The flow of energy from of
one organism to another in a sequence of
food transfer is known as a foodchain. A
simple foodchain is like the following
Grass→ Insect→ Frogs→ Snake→ Hawk
● Food Web A network of foodchains or
feeding relationships, by which energy and
nutrients are passed on from one specie of
living organism to another is called food
web.
● Trophic Levels Trophic levels are the
feeding position in a foodchain such as
primary producers, herbivore, primary
carnivore etc. Generally, green plants
form the first trophic level, the
producers, herbivores form the second
trophic level, while carnivores and
omnivores form the third and even the
fourth trophic levels.
● Ecological Pyramid An ecological
pyramid is a graphical representation
designed to show the number of
organisms, energy relationships and
biomass of an ecosystem. They are also
called Eltonian Pyramids after Charles
Elton, who developed the concept of
ecological pyramids. Producer organisms
(usually green plants) from the base of
the pyramid, with succeeding levels
above representing the different tropic
levels.
● Succeeding levels in the pyramid
represent the dependence of the
organisms at a given level on the
organisms at lower level.
● Pyramid of Biomass Biomass is
renewable organic (living) material. A
pyramid of biomass is a representation of
the amount of energy contained in
biomass at different trophic levels for a
particular time.
● It is measured in grams per meter or
calories per meter. This demonstrates the
amount of matter lost between trophic
levels.
● Pyramid of Energy The pyramid of
energy represents the total amount of
energy consumed at each trophic level.
219
ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● An energy pyramid is always upright as the total amount of energy available for
utilisation in the layers above is less than the energy available in the lower levels.
● Biome Biome is a large natural ecosystem, wherein we study the total assemblage of
plant and animal communities. Biosphere is the largest ecosystem on the Earth,
divided into biomes.
● Ecological Niche Organisms in ecosystem get evolved for particular task. This task or
role, which an organism plays in ecosystem is called as ecological niche.

POLLUTION
Environmental pollution is the effect of
undesirable changes in our surroundings
that have harmful effects on plants, animals
and human beings.
Pollutants Pollutants are substances which
cause pollution. They could be in any from
solid, liquid or gaseous.
● A primary pollutant is substance emitted
directly from a source.
● A secondary pollution is not directly
emitted as such, but forms, when other
pollutants (primary pollutants) react in
the atmosphere.
Primary pollutants
● Sulphur dioxide (SO )2
, nitrogen oxides
(NO )2
, carbon monoxide (CO), chlorofluoro carbons (CFCs), carbon dioxide
(CO )2
, Suspended Particulate Matter
(SPM) and Ammonia (NH )3
volatile
organic compounds, toxic metals etc.
Secondary pollutants
1. Particulate matter formed from
gaseous primary pollutants and
compounds in photochemical smog,
such as nitrogen dioxide.
2. Ground level ozone (O )3
formed from
N2
and Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOCs).
3. Peroxyacety l Nitrate (PAN) similarly
formed from NO2
and VOCs.
Air Pollution
It is the contamination of air by a variety of
substances causing health problems and
damaging our environment.
Air Pollutants
Some of the most common air pollutants are
as follows.
● Carbon Monoxide (CO) is produced from
incomplete combustion of fuel such as
natural gas, coal and wood.
● It is also produced in tobacco smoke. It
slows our reflexes and makes us feel
sleepy.
● Carbon Dioxide ( ) CO2
is the principal
greenhouse gas and is primarily
responsible for the greenhouse effect. It
can be formed from all types of common
human activities, such as burning fuels
and even breathing.
● Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were
generally used in great quantities in
industry, for refrigeration and
air-conditioning and in consumer
products.
● Ozone ( )O3
gas occurs naturally in the
upper atmosphere where it shields the
Earth from the Sun’s dangerous
ultraviolet rays. When found at ground
level, it’s a pollutant.
● Nitrogen Oxide and Sulphur Dioxide
are major contributors to smog and acid
rain. These gases both react with
volatile organic compounds to form
smog, which can cause respiratory
problems in humans. Acid rain can
harm vegetation, change the chemistry
of river and lake water by lowering the
pH which is harmful to animal life and
react with the marble statues and
buildings to decompose them.
Controls/Measures of Air
Pollution
● Suitable fuel selection
● Modification in industrial processes
● Correct selection of manufacturing sites
● More efficient engines
● Awareness for using public transport so
that air pollution is minimised
Water Pollution
● It is the contamination of water bodies
(e.g. lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and
groundwater). Water pollution occurs
when pollutants are discharged directly
or indirectly into water bodies without
adequate treatment to remove harmful
compounds.
● Biological Oxygen Demond (BOD) It
is a measurement of amount of
dissolved oxygen that is used by aerobic
micro-organisms when decomposing
organic matter in water. It is an
important water quality parameter and
is an indicator of organic pollution.
Control/Measures of Water
Pollution
● Mass social awareness should be
generated.
● Ground water pollution can be
eliminated by maintaining strict
restrictions regarding waste disposal.
● Industrial effluents should be effectively
recycled, before releasing in water.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography 221
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Geography
● Government Initiatives National Water
Policy, 2002, Water (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Act, 1974,
establishment of pollution control boards,
oil spill response centre etc are some
government initiatives to control water
pollution.
● National River Conservation Plan,
Namami Gange programme have also
been started to cleanup the precious rivers
in India.
Noise Pollution
● Noise can be taken as a group of loud,
non-harmonious sounds or vibrations that
are unpleasant and irritating to ear.
Decibel is the standard for the
measurement of noise.
● Noise pollution creates many diseases
such as hypertension, hearing loss, sleep
disturbances etc. Continuous noise can
create panic situations or even increase
frustration levels. It also impacts the
health of wildlife on land as well as oceans.
● Under the Environment Protection Act,
1986, the Central Government has come
up with rules to curb the noise pollution.
Land Pollution
● It refers to degradation or destruction of
Earth’s surface and soil, directly or
indirectly as a result of human activities. It
explains any activity that lessens the
quality or productivity of the land as an
ideal place for agriculture, forestation,
construction, etc.
Causes of Land Pollution
● Deforestation and soil erosion.
● Agricultural Activities Use of highly toxic
fertilisers and pesticides as well as mining
activities.
● Overcrowded Landfills Garbage which
cannot be recycled become a part of the
landfills.
● Industrialisation Creation of more waste
by industries that needs to be disposed off.
● Nuclear Waste The left over radioactive
material contains harmful and toxic
chemicals that can affect human health.
They are dumped beneath the Earth to
avoid any casuality.
● Sewage Treatment Large amount of solid
waste is leftover once the sewage has been
treated. The leftover material is sent to
landfill site which pollutes the
environment.
Solutions for Land Pollution
● Make people aware about the concept
of reduce, recycle and reuse.
● Practicing organic farming which uses
no chemical pesticides and fertilisers
in agricultural activities.
● Avoid buying packages items as they
will lead to garbage.
● No littering on ground and proper
disposal of garbage.
● Using bio-degradable products.
● Organic gardening and organic food.
e-Waste
It is a term used to cover almost all types
of Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(EEE) that could enter into the waste
stream. Although e-waste is a general
term, it can be considered to cover TVs,
computers, mobile phones, white goods
(e.g. fridges, washing machines, dryers
etc) home entertainment and stereo
systems, toys, toasters, kettles and almost
any households or business item with
circuitry or electrical components with
power or battery supply which have been
discarded.
Radioactive Pollution
● It is the release of any radioactive
material into the environment.
Radioactive pollution can be very
dangerous because radiation mutates
DNA, causing abnormal growth and
possibly cancer and this radiation
remains in the environment for years,
slowly diminishing over time.
Radioactive pollution is mainly caused
by nuclear accidents, nuclear
explosion, accident during production
or use of radioactive materials. There
are techniques used to manage this
pollution, however, we are far from
keeping our planet clean of radioactive
pollution.
Biodiversity
● Biodiversity refers to the variety within
the living world. The term is commonly
used to describe the number, variety
and variability of living organisms.
● Often used as a synonym of Life on the
Earth. It means genetic variation,
species variation or ecosystem
variation within an area, biome or
planet.
222
● Biodiversity is often seen in the terms of
three fundamental and hierarchically
related levels of biological organisation.
● Genetic diversity represents the
heritable variation within and between
population of organisms.
● Species diversity refers to number of
species in a site or habitat.
● Ecosystem diversity refers to diversity
of different organisms at the ecosystem,
habitat or community level.
Biodiversity Hotspots
● A biodiversity hotspot is a bio-geographic
region with a significant reservoir of
biodiversity that is under threat from
humans. The concept of biodiversity
hotspots was given by Norman Myers.
● To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot a
region must meet two strict criterias. It
must contain at least 0.5% or 1500
species of vascular plants as endemics
and it has to have lost at least 70% of its
primary vegetation. India has two
biodiversity hotspots—Western Ghats
and Eastern Himalayas. Indo-Burma
Region and Sundaland (including
Nicobar group of Islands).
Biodiversity Conservation
Conservation is planned management of
natural resources to retain the balance in
nature and retain the diversity. It
emphasises on the wise use of natural
resources by accepting the idea of
sustainable development. Conservation of
biodiversity is carried out in the following
ways.
Method of Conservation
The method of conservation of biodiversity
can be classified into two groups.
In-Situ (On Site)
Conservation include protection of plants
and animals within their natural habitats
or in protected areas. Protected areas are
land or sea dedicated to protect and
maintain biodiversity. Examples are
Biosphere Reserves, National Parks,
Wildlife Sanctuaries, etc.
Ex-Situ (Off Site)
Conservation of plants and animals outside
their natural habitats. These include
botanical gardens, zoos, gene banks of seed,
tissue culture and cryopreservation.
Threatened Species
Threatened species are any species
(including animals, plants, fungi, etc.)
which are vulnerable to endangering in the
near future. Species that are threatened
are sometimes characterised by the
population dynamics measure of critical
depensation, a mathematical measure of
biomass related to population growth rate.
This quantitative metric is one method of
evaluating the degree of danger.
IUCN
The International Union for Conservation
of Nature (IUCN) is the foremost authority
on threatened species, and treats
threatened species not as a single category,
but as a group of three categories,
depending on the degree to which they are
threatened :
● Vulnerable species : A vulnerable species
is one which has been categorised by the
International Union for Conservation of
Nature as likely to become endangered
unless the circumstances threating its
survival and reproduction improve.
● Endangered species : An endangered
species is a species which has been
categorised as indanger and is likely to
become extinct.
● Critically endangered species :
A critically endangered (CR) species is
one which has been categorised by the
International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) as facing a very high risk
of extinction in the wild. It is the highest
risk category assigned by the IUCN Red
List for wild species.
IUCN Red List
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
(also known as the IUCN Red List or Red
Data List), founded in 1964, is the world’s
most comprehensive inventory of the global
conservation status of biological species.

Climate Change
Climate change refers to long-term change
in the earth’s climate, especially a change
due to an increase in average atmospheric
temperature. In the past, Earth’s climate has
gone through warmer and cooler periods,
each lasting thousands of years.
Greenhouse Effect and Global
Warming
● The greenhouse gases (sometimes
abbreviated as GHG) in the atmosphere
absorbs and emits radiation within the
thermal infrared range. The process is the
fundamental cause of the greenhouse
effect. The primary greenhouse gases in
the Earth’s atmosphere are water vapour,
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide
and ozone. In the Solar System, the
atmosphere of Venus, Mars and Titan also
contain gases that cause greenhouse effects.
● Global Warming is the increase of Earth’s
average surface temperatue due to effect
of greenhouse gases, such as carbon
dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels
or from deforestation.
Kyoto Protocol
● The Kyoto Protocol is a protocol to the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aimed at
fighting global warming. The UNFCCC
is an international environmental
treaty with the goal of achieving the
‘‘stabilisation of greehouse gas
concentration in the atmosphere at a
level that would prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the
climate system’’. The protocol was
initially adopted on 11th December,
1997 in Kyoto, Japan and entered into
force on 16th February, 2005. Second
commitment period of this protocol
started in 2013 and will end in 2020.
● The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted
an average global rise in temperature of
1.4°C to 5.8°C between 1990 and 2100.
If successfully and completely implemented, the Kyoto Protocol will reduce
that increase by somewhere between
0.02°C and 0.28°C by the year 2050.

Degradation (REDD) is an effort to
create a financial value for the
carbon stored in forests, offering
incentives to developing countries to
reduce emissions from forested lands
and invest in low carbon paths to
sustainable development.
● ‘REDD+’ goes beyond deforestation
and forest degradation and includes
the role of conservation, sustainable
management of forests and
enhancement of forest carbon
stocks.
● The proper implementation of
REDD+ will contribute to protection
of biodiversity, resilience of forest
ecosystems and poverty reduction.
Ozone Layer Depletion
● The ozone layer is located within the
Stratosphere, about 24 km above the Earth’s
surface.
● The layer consist of ozone gas molecules that
are formed as the sunlight reacts with oxygen.
● The ozone layer is very important as it
protects life on Earth by filtering the Sun’s
dangerous ultraviolet radiation.
● Due to increased pollution on Earth,
chemicals such as Chloro Fluro Carbons
(CFCs) are destroying this protective ozone
layer, which could lead to increased health
risks and damage agricultural and acquatic
ecosystem.
Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer
● It is an international treaty designed to
protect the ozone layer from Chloro Fluoro
Carbons (CFCs).
● The treaty was opened for signature on 16th
September, 1987 and entered into force on
1st January, 1989, followed by a first meeting
in Helsinki, May 1989.

Glossary
Bio Fuels are produced from dry organic
matter or combustible oils from plants such
as alcohol from fermented sugar, black
liquor from the paper manufacturing
process, wood and soyabean oil.
Biogas Gas rich in methane, which is
produced by the fermentation of animal
dung, human sewage or crop residues in an
airtight container.
Biomass Organic material, both above ground
and below ground and living and dead, such
as trees, crops, grasses and roots.
Carbon credit The concept of Carbon Credit
came into existence as a result of increasing
awareness of the need for pollution control.
Carbon credits are certificates awarded to
countries that successfully reduce the
emissions that cause global warming.
Carbon Credits are measured in units of
Certified Emission Reductions (CERs).
Each CER is equivalent to one tonne ofCO2
reduction.
Carbon Footprint The Carbon Footprint is a
measurement of all greenhouse gases in
terms of tonnes or kg of CO2
equivalent.
Carbon Market The Kyoto Protocol allows
countries that have emissions units to spare
the emissions permitted but not ‘used’ to
sell this excess capacity to countries that
are over their targets. This is called the
carbon market, because carbon dioxide is
the most widely produced greenhouse gas
and because of this other greenhouse gases
will be recorded and counted in terms of
their ‘carbon dioxide equivalents’.
Green Tax It is a tax with a potentially positive
environmental impact. It includes energy
tax, transport taxes and taxes on pollution
and resources. They are also called
environmental taxes.
Biomes Biomes are regions of the world with
similar climate (weather, temperature),
animals and plants.
Examples of Aquatic biomes are : Fresh
water, marine, Coral reef and Estuaries.
Examples of Terrestrial biomes are :
Tundra, Rainforest, Savanna, Taiga, Alpine
and Desert etc.
Environment The environment is the
biotic and abiotic surrounding of an
organism or population and includes
particularly the factor that have an
influence in their survival,
development and evolution.
Ecology It is the scientific study of the
relations that living organisms have
with respect to each other and their
natural environment.
Ecosystem An ecosystem is a biological
system consiting of all the living
organisms or biotic components in a
particular area and the non-living or
abiotic components with which the
organisms interact such as air,
mineral soil, water and sunlight.
Biosphere The biosphere is the portion
of Earth, in which all known life
forms exist. If includes a thin layer of
air (atmosphere), water
(hydrosphere) and Earth
(lithosphere).
Geosphere The atmosphere,
hydrosphere, lithosphere and
biosphere are together referred to as
the Geosphere.
Mitigation The structural and nonstructural measures undertaken to
limit the adverse impact of natural
hazards, environmental degradation
and technological hazards.
Sustainable Development
Development that meet the needs of
the present generation without
compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own
needs.
Ecological Pyramid An Ecological
Pyramid is a graphical
representation designed to show the
biomass or biomass productivity at
each Trophic level in a given
ecosystem.
Trophic Level Successive stages of
nourishment as represented by the
links of the foodchain.

PARTS OF THE CONSTITUTION
EVOLUTION OF STATES AND
UNION TERRITORIES
Dhar Commission
The Constituent Assembly appointed the SK Dhar Commission in June 1948, to study the
feasibility of the reorganisation of the states on linguistic basis. It was felt that such
reorganisation would fuel regional sentiments and might threaten national integration
which was precarious in the background of Partition. Thus, the Dhar Commission
categorically rejected the basis of linguistic formation of states.
JVP Committee
● The Congress in its Jaipur Session in 1948, appointed a three member committee to
consider the recommendation of the Dhar Commission. Its members were Jawaharlal
Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Pattabhi Sitaramayya.
● The Committee rejected language as the basis for the reorganisation despite popular
support for it.
First Linguistic State
■
In October 1953, the Government of India was forced to create the First Linguistic State, known as
Andhra Pradesh, by separating the Telugu speaking area from Madras Presidency (after the death of
Sriramulu, a Congress person).
■ Kurnool was the first capital of the Andhra State with High Court at Guntur.

Fazl Ali Commission
After the creation of Andhra State, demand
for creation of states on linguistic basis
intensified and Fazl Ali Commission was
constituted in December, 1953, (also
known as States Reorganisation
Commission) accepted language as the
basis of reorganisations of state but rejected
the theory of ‘one-language-one state’. By
the States Reorganisation Act (1956) and
the 7th Constitutional Amendment Act, the
distinction between states was abolished.
Some of them were merged with adjacent
state and some other were designated as
Union Territories. As a result 14 States
and 6 Union Territories were created on
1st November, 1956.
Reorganisation

Pradesh was elevated to the status of a
state.
● In 1971, Manipur, Tripura and
Meghalaya were granted statehood. In

of the Indian Union. By the
36th Constitutional Amendment Act
(1975), Sikkim became a full fledged
State of the Indian Union.
● In 1986, Mizoram and Arunachal
Pradesh came into being.
● In 1987, Goa came into existence. In
2000, three more new states :
Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and
Jharkhand were created.
● On 2nd June, 2014, Telengana state
came into existence, after
reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh.
● On 31st Oct, 2019, J&K States was
bifurcated in two Union Territory, J&K

and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli
got merged into single UT.
Union Territories
● Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh National
Capital Territory of Delhi, Puducherry,
Andaman and Nicobar are headed by the
Lieutenant Governor.

Haveli have a common administrator.
From 26th of January, both the UTs have
been merged into single UT named
‘Dadra and Nagar Haveli’ and ‘Daman

also governed by an administrator.
● J and K, Delhi and Puducherry have
Legislative Assemblies. There are total
Nine Union Territories-Delhi, Puducherry,

National Capital Territory of India. It
could legislate in certain matters except
land, Police and law and order.
● The Preamble means Introduction or
Preface of the Constitution or essence of
the Constitution. NA Palkivala, an
eminent jurist and Constitutional expert,
called the Preamble as the identity card
of the Constitution. India followed the
USA to include Preamble in the
Constitution. The Preamble of the Indian
Constitution is based on the Objectives
Resolution drafted and moved by
Pandit Nehru and adopted by the
Constituent Assembly.
● The idea of Justice, Social, Economic and
Political have been taken from the
Russian Revolution (1917).

concept of ‘Rule of law’- propounded by AV
Dicey, the British Jurist.

Some of the exceptions are
¡ The President or the Governor is not
answerable to any court for the exercise and

Article 15 Prohibition of discrimination on
certain grounds. It says that the state shall not
discriminate against any citizen on grounds of
religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. This
provision prohibits discrimination both by state

Right to Property as a Fundamental
Right (Article 31).
● The right under Article 30 also includes
the right of a minority to impart
education to its children in its own
language.
Right to Constitutional
Remedies (Article 32)
● Dr BR Ambedkar said, Article 32 is the
heart and soul of the Constitution.
● Supreme Court ruled that Article 32 is a
basic feature of the Constitution.
Hence, it cannot be abridged or taken
away even by way of an amendment to
the Constitution. Under Article 32,
Supreme Court and Article 226, High
Court can issue writs of various forms in
case of violation of Fundamental Rights:
● Habeas Corpus It is a Latin term which
literally means, ‘to have the body of,’. It is
an order issued by the court to a person
who has detained another person, to
produce the body of the latter before it.
The court then examines the cause and
legality of detention. It would set the
detained person free, if the detention is
found to be illegal. This writ may be
addressed to an official or a private
person, who has another person in his
custody.
● Mandamus It literally means ‘we
command’. It is a command issued by
the court to a public official asking him
to perform his official duties that he has
failed or refused to perform. It can also
be issued against any public body, a
corporation, an inferior court, a tribunal
or government for the same purpose.
● Quo-warranto In the literal sense, it
means ‘‘by what authority or warrant’’. It
is issued to enquire into the legality of
claim of a person to a public office.
Hence, it prevents illegal usurpation of
public office by a person. The writ can be
issued only in case of a substantive
public office of a permanent character
244 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity
created by a statute or by the Constitution. It cannot be issued in cases of ministerial
office or private office.
● Prohibition Literally means ‘to forbid’. It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or
tribunal to prevent the latter from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a jurisdiction
that, it does not possess.
Thus, unlike mandamus that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity. The writ
of prohibition can be issued only against judicial and Quasi- Judicial authorities. It is
not available against Administrative Authorities, Legislative Bodies and private
individuals or bodies.
● Certiorari In the literal sense, it means, ’to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’. It is issued
by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a case pending with the
latter to itself or to squash the order of the latter in a case. It is issued on the grounds of
excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or error of law. Thus, unlike prohibition,
which is only preventive, certiorari is both preventive as well as curative.
Limitations on the Enforcement of Fundamental Rights
● Parliament has the power to modify the application of the Fundamental Rights to the
members of the Armed Forces, Police Forces or Intelligence Organisations so as to
ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline among them
(Article 33).
● Certain Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution may remain suspended,
while a Proclamation of Emergency is made by the President under Article 352.
● Article 34 Restriction on Rights conferred by this Part while martial law is in force in
any area.
● Article 35 Legislation, to give effect to the provisions of this part.

LEGISLATIVE
PROCEDURE
IN PARLIAMENT
● The legislative procedure is identical in
both the Houses of Parliament. Every bill
has to pass through the same stages in
each House. A Bill is a proposal for
legislation and it becomes an Act or law
when duly enacted.
● Bills may be classified under four heads
viz, Ordinary, Money, Financial and
Constitutional Amendment Bills. The
Legislative procedure of government bills
and private members bill is same.
● Money Bills cannot be introduced in the
Rajya Sabha. The other bills can be
introduced in either House.
● Every ordinary bill has to pass through
five stages in the Parliament i.e. first
Reading, second Reading, third Reading,
Bill in the second House and Assent of
the President. Finally, the Bill has to be
notified by the Government to enable its
implementation.
Stages of Bills
The different stages in the passage of Bills
other than the Money Bills are as follows
Introduction of the Bill
● It involves introduction of Bill like
provisions of the proposed law,
accompanied by the ‘Statement of
Objects and Reasons’. Private member
must give one month notice to introduce
the Bill.
● After that it is published in the Gazette of
India. The introduction of the Bill and its
publication in the Gazette constitutes the
First Reading of the Bill.
Special Powers of Rajya Sabha
Due to its federal character, the Rajya Sabha
has been given two exclusive or special powers
that are not enjoyed by the Lok Sabha.
■
It can authorise the Parliament to make a law
on a subject enumerated in the State List
(Article 249).
■
It can authorise the Parliament to create new
All-India Services Common for both the centre
and states (Article 312).
Second Reading of the Bill
● In the second reading principles of the
Bill are discussed in details and the
treasury and the opposition members
give their views either in support or
opposition of the Bill.
● The second reading is divided into two
stages, (i) consists of a general
discussion of the principles of the Bill
and (ii) relates to discussion of clauses,
schedules and amendments.
● If the Bill is referred to the Selected
Committee or Joint Committee, it is
expected to give its report within a
specified date.
● The Bill then undergoes long
discussions clause by clause and may
undergo substantial change.
Third Reading of the Bill
● The third reading is the final reading. It
is more or less a formal affair. The
debate is confined to the acceptance or
rejection of the Bill. The Bill is
submitted to the vote of the House and
has to be accepted or rejected
altogether.
Bill in the Second House
● After the Bill has been passed by one
House, it is transmitted to the other
House, where it has to pass through the
same process. The other House has four
alternatives before it.
1. It may pass the Bill as sent by the first
House.
2. It may pass the Bill with amendments
and return it to the first House.
3. It may reject the Bill altogether.
4. It may not take any action and thus
keep the Bill pending.
● In case the Bill is also passed by the
second House or the first House agrees
with the amendmendments made by the
second house, the Bill is sent to the
President for his assent.
● In case the Bill is rejected by the second
House or it is kept by the second House
with it for six months without any action
or the first House disagrees with the
amendments suggested by the second
House, a deadlock is deemed to have
taken place.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity 261
● To resolve a deadlock, the President may
summon a joint-sitting of the two Houses
under Article 108. If the majority of members
present and voting at the joint-sitting pass the
Bill, it is considered as passed by both Houses
of Parliament and is sent for President’s assent.
Assent of the President
● After being passed by both Houses (either
Singles or at Joint Sitting), when the Bill is
presented to the President, he has three
options
1. He may assent to the Bill
2. He may withhold his assent
3. He may return the Bill for the
reconsideration of the Houses.
● If the President gives assents to the Bill, it
becomes an Act.
● If the President withholds his assent, the Bill
ends.
● If the President returns the Bill for
reconsideration and it is passed again by both
the Houses, he has to give his assent after the
second passage.
● Since, the Constitution provides no time limit
for the President to give his assent, he may
keep the Bill in his office without taking any
action and prevent it from becoming an act.
Consolidated Fund
of India (Article 266)
● It is a fund to which all receipts are
credited and all payments are
debited. In other words,
¡ all revenues received by the
Government of India.
¡ all loans raised by the government
by the issue of treasury bills, loans
or ways and means of advances.
¡ all money received by the government in repayment of loans from
the Consolidated Fund of India.
● All the legally authorised payments
on behalf of the government are
made out of this fund. No money
out of this fund can be appropriated
(issued or drawn) except in
accordance with a Parliamentary law.
Contingency Fund of India
(Article 267)
● Article 267 of the Constitution
authorised the Parliament to
establish a ‘Contingency Fund of
India’, into which amounts
determined by law are paid from time
to time. Accordingly, the Parliament
enacted the Contingency Fund of
India Act in 1950.
● This fund is placed at the disposal
of the President and he can make
advances out of it to meet
unforeseen expenditure pending its
authorisation by the Parliament.
● The fund is held by the finance
secretary on behalf of President.
Public Account of India
● Article 266 (2) provides that all
other public moneys (other than
those in the Consolidated Fund of
India) received by or on behalf of
the Government of India or the
Government of a State shall be
credited to the Public Account of
India or the Public Account of the
State, as the case may be. This
account is operated by executive
action and payments from it do not
need Parliamentary approval.
● Moneys in this account include
provident fund deposits, savings
bank deposits, remittances etc.
262 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity
Budget in Parliament
■ The Constitution refers to the budget as the
‘annual financial statement’. In other
words, the term ‘budget’ has nowhere been used in
the Constitution. ‘Annual Financial Statement’ has
been dealt within Article 112 of the Constitution.
■ The budget is a statement of the estimated
receipts and expenditure of the Government of
India in a financial year, which begins on 1st April
and ends on 31st March of the following year.
■ After introduction of the Budget, the Lok Sabha
discusses the demands for grants of various
ministries and departments. All grants voted by the
Lok Sabha and expenditure, charged on the
consolidated fund of India, are then presented in
the form of single Bill called the ‘Appropriation
Bill’. Proposals for taxation (to raise revenue) are
presented in the form of ‘Finance Bill’.
■ The Government of India has two budgets, namely,
the Railway Budget and the General Budget.
■ From 2017, Railway Budget has been merged with
the General Budget on the recommendation of
Bibek Debroy Committee.
Committee System

members of Parliament can discuss and
debate on the working of a certain
department of the government.

the direction of the Speaker and are
essentially committees of the Lok Sabha.
● Committees are classified under two
heads : Standing Committee and Adhoc
Committees. Ad Hoc Committees are
created for a temporary period.
● The Standing Committees are broadly
classified into the following categories :

Since, 1967, a convention has developed
whereby the Chairman of the Committee is
selected invariably from the opposition.
● The origin of the Estimates Committee can
be traced to the Standing Financial
Committee set-up in 1921. The first
Estimates Committee was set-up in 1950.
It has thirty members, all from the Lok
Sabha only. The Rajya Sabha has no
presentation in this committee.
● The Committee on Public Undertakings
was created in 1964 on the recommendations of the Krishna Menon Committee. It
has 22 members (15 from the Lok Sabha
and 7 from the Rajya Sabha).
● In 1993, 17 Department Related Standing
Committees were set-up. In 2004, 7 more
committees were set-up. Thus, total
24 committees exist as of today.
● Members of the Rajya Sabha are
associated with all the committees except
the Estimates Committee.
● The Chairman of all the committees
(except the Joint Committee on
salaries and allowances of MPs) are
appointed by the Speaker from
amongst the members of the
committee.
● In case, Speaker is a member of a
committee, he becomes Ex-officio
Chairman of the committee.

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity 269
HIGH COURT
● Every High Court (whether exclusive or common) consists of a Chief Justice and such
other judges as the President may from time to time deem necessary to appoint. Thus,
the Constitution does not specify the strength of a High Court and leaves it to the
discretion of the President.
● Accordingly, the President determines the strength of a High Court from time to time
depending upon its workload.
● The Constitution of India provides a High Court for each state, but the 7th
Amendment Act of 1956, authorised the Parliament to establish a common High Court
for two or more states or a state and a union territory.
● The territorial jurisdiction of a High Court is co-terminus with the territory of a state.
● As of 2019, there are 25 High Courts in India. Telangana is the 25th High Court.
270 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity
Powers of the State Legislature
● It participates in the election of the President.
● It can remove the Council of Ministers by passing a No-Confidence Motion.
● It controls the executive by various financial committees. It ratifies certain

(except Bihar).
Union-State Relations
The federal system adopted in India
involves division of authority between the
union and the states. Relations between
the union and states can be studied under
the following parts.
A. Legislative Relations (Art.
245-255)
● The Constitution divides the subjects
into the Union List (100 subjects), the
State List (61 subjects) and the
Concurrent List (52 subjects).
Enumerated in the Seventh Schedule
under Article 246. Parliament has
exclusive power to legislate on subjects
mentioned in the Union List. This list
contains subjects like defence, foreign
affairs, atomic energy etc.
● State Legislatures have exclusive power
to legislate on subjects mentioned in the
State List. The State List contains
subjects like health, sanitation, public
order, agriculture etc. Both Parliament
and State Legislatures can legislate on
subjects mentioned in the Concurrent
List. This list contains subjects like
criminal law, forests, education,
marriage and divorce etc.
● Residual Powers (i.e. subjects not
included in any of the list) rest with
Union Government.
Lok Adalat
■ Lok Adalat (People’s Courts), established by the
government, settles disputes through
conciliation and compromise. The first Lok
Adalat was held in Gujrat on 14th March, 1982.
■ The Lok Adalat is presided over by a sitting or
retired judicial officer as Chairman, with two
other member, usually a lawyer and a social
worker. There is no court fee. If the case is
already filed in a regular court, the fee paid is
refunded if the dispute is settled at the Lok
Adalat.
■ Lok Adalat is very effective in settlement of
money claims. Disputes, like partition suits,
damages and matrimonial cases, can also be
easily settled in Lok Adalat, as chances of
compromise through give and take approach
stand high in such cases.
■ Lok Adalat is a boon to the litigant public,
where they can get their disputes settled fast
and free of cost.
■ Lok Adalats have been given the status of a
Civil Court and every award made by the Lok
Adalat is final and binding on all parties and no
appeals lies to any court against its award.
B. Administrative Relations
(Art. 256-263)
The states are expected to comply with the
Laws of the Parliament and not impede the
exercise of the Executive Powers of the
Union (Articles 256, 257). In this regard, the
Union Government can issue necessary
directives to the states. All disputes between
states regarding the use, distribution or
control of water are decided by the centre
(Article 262).
C. Financial Relations (Art. 268-293)
● The states are greatly dependent on the
Central Government for finance. The State
Governments have been provided
independent sources of revenue, but these
are inadequate.
● The Union Government has the power to
borrow from within India or outside,
subject to the limits laid down by the
Parliament, the borrowing power of the
states is subject to several limitations and
the cannot borrow from outside India.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Polity 273

Punchhi Commission
In April, 2007, a new commission was set-up to
re-examine centre-state relations. The
commission was headed by former Chief
Justice of India MM Punchhi.
The major recommendations of the Punchhi
Commission can be summed up as follows
● There should be an amendment in Articles
355 and 356 to enable the centre to bring
specific trouble-torn areas under its rule for
a limited period.
● Inter-State Relation An Inter- State
Council can be established by the President
under Article 263 of the Constitution of
India. The function of the Inter-State
Council is to investigate and discuss
subjects in which states and union have a
common interest. It also makes recommendations for better co-ordination of
policy and action with respect to a subject.
● Under Article 262, Parliament has
constituted the Inter-State Water Disputes
Tribunal for adjudication of disputes
between states for the waters of any
inter-state river or river valley.
● Inter-state river water disputes are
excluded from the jurisdiction of all
courts including the Supreme Court.
● The commission has proposed
‘‘localising emergency provision’’ under
Articles 355 and 356, contending that
localised areas either a district or part
of a district be brought under government rule instead of the whole state.
● The commission supports the
Governor’s right to give sanction for the
prosecution of ministers against the
advice of the State Government.
● There should be changes in the role of
the Governor including fixed five year
tenure as well as their removal only
through impeachment by the State
Assembly.
● It has been proposed that the
appointment of Governor should be
entrusted to a committee comprising
the Prime Minister, Home Minister,
Speaker of the Lok Sabha and Chief
Minister of the concerned state.
Sarkaria Commission
It was set-up in June, 1983, by the Central
Government of India to examine the

INTRODUCTION OF ECONOMICS
INDIAN
ECONOMY
The term economics comes from the ancient
Greek word oikonomia mean management of
a household. Economic is the social science
that studies economic activities to gain
an understanding of the processes that
govern the production, distribution and
consumption of goods and services in an
economy.
Economics includes the study of labour, land
and investments of capital, income and
production and taxes and government
expenditures. Adam Smith, regarded as the
Father of Economics, defines Economics as,
‘‘The science relating to the laws of
production, distribution and exchange.’’
Branches of Economics
The two chief branches are as follow:
Micro Economics
● It is concerned with how supply and
demand interact in individual market and
how these interactions determine the
price level of goods and services.
● It examine the economic behaviour of
individual actor/agent at the level of the
economic entity–the individual firm, the
individual consumer and the individual
worker.
It examine the behaviour of basic elements in
the economy, including individual agents
(such as households and firms or as buyers
and sellers) and market and their interaction.
Macro Economics
It studies the economy as a whole and its
features like national income, unemployment,
poverty, balance of payments and inflation.
It deals with formulation of models
explaining relationship between factors
such as consumption, inflation, savings,
investment, national income and
finance.
ECONOMY
It represents production, distribution or
trade and consumption of goods and
services in a given geographical area by
different agents, which can be
individuals, businesses, organisation or
governments.
The study of economy of any country
helps us to find out the financial
condition of the population as well as the
different working sectors of the economy.
The modern economy is a complex
machine. Its job is to allocate limited
resources and distribute output among a
large number of agents mainly
individuals, firms and governments
allowing for the possibility that each
agent’s action can directly (or indirectly)
affect other agent’s actions. There are
two major type of economies.
Open Economy
An economy said to be open, if it has trade
with other economies. In this economy,
market is mostly free from trade barriers
and where exports and imports from a
large percentage of the GDP.
Degree of openness of an economy
determines a government’s freedom to
pursue economic policies of its choice
and the susceptibility of the country to
the international economic cycles.
Closed Economy
An economy in which no activity is
conducted with outside economies. In
simple language, no imports are brought in
and no exports are sent out in closed
economy.
The goal of such economy is to provide
consumers with everything that they need
from within the economy’s borders and
government act as the arbitrator, articulator
and facilitator.
In India, since independence, the
government has played a major role in
planning economic activities.
Present Status of Indian Economy
■
Indian economy is world’s 5th largest economy
(as per December, 2019) or nominal GDP basis
and the 3rd largest by Purchasing Power Party
(PPP) in 2019.
■ According to CSO-The growth in GDP during
2017-18 is estimated at 6.5% as compared to
the growth rate of 7.1% in 2016-17.
■ During each of the previous two year, 2014-15
and 2015-16, India’s Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) (Base year 2011-12) grew by 7.2% and
7.6% respectively per annum.
■ From 1951 until 2013, India GDP Annual
Growth rate averaged 5.8% reaching an all
time high of 10.2% in December of 1988 and a
record low of 5.2% in December of 1979.
■ On a per capita income basis, India ranked
141th by nominal GDP and 126th by GDP (PPP)
in 2017, according to the IMF.
■ Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory,
which states that exchanges rates between
currencies are balanced, when their purchasing
power is the same in each of the two countries.
Broad Sectors of Indian
Economy
Primary Sector
The primary sector include production of
raw material and includes agriculture,
forestry, fishing, mining and quarrying .
Secondary Sector
The secondary sector of economy is involved
in the production of finished goods. Mining
manufacturing, electricity, gas and water
supply, construction (also called
manufacturing sector).
Tertiary Sector
These sector provides services to the
general population and business.
Business, transport, telecommunication,
banking, insurance, real estate,
community and personnel services (also
called service sector).
Nature of Indian Economy
● Mixed Economy It is an economy,
where both public and private sector
co-exist. The nature of Indian economy
is a mixed economy. The term Mixed
economy was coined by JM Keynes.
Mixed economy are often under
government regulation.
● Developing Economy Following
features shows that Indian economy is a
developing economy
(a) Low per capita income.
(b) Occupational pattern is primary
sector dominated.
(c) Heavy population pressure.
(d) Prevalence of chronic
unemployment and
underemployment.
(e) Steadily improving rate of capital
formation.
(f) Low capital per head.
(g) Unequal distribution of wealth/
assets.
● Agrarian Economy An agrarian
economy is a type of economy that
relies primarily on agricultural industry
including livestock farming or corp
production. It is form of economy
whose major factor of production in the
agricultural land.
NATIONAL INCOME
OF INDIA
● National Income (NI) is the net value
of all the final goods and services
produced by its nationals during a
financial year. It is a flow concept. In
India, the financial year is from
1st April to 31st March. The national
income is calculated annually.
● According to National Income
Committee (1949). “A national income
estimate measures the volume of
commodities and service turned out
290 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy
during a given period counted without
duplication”.
● NI = C + G + I + (X −M) + (R − P)
− Depreciation − Indirect tax +
Subsidies.
C = Total Consumption Expenditure
I = Total Investment Expenditure
G = Total Government Expenditure
X = Export
M = Import
(R-P)= Net Faction Income from abroad.
● When the National Income is measured
at the base year price, it is called
national income at constant price.
● When the national income is measured
at the current year price, it is called
national income at current year price.
● When NNP is calculated at Factor Cost
(FC) it is called National Income. This
measure is calculated by deducting
indirect taxes and adding subsidies in
NNP at Market Price (MP).
● NNPFC= NNPMP – Indirect
Taxes + Subsidies + Government
surplus = National Income.
● NI = NNP + Subsidies − Indirect taxes
● GNP − Depreciation − Indirect taxes +
Subsidies.
● The CSO released the ‘New series’ of
national accounts with base year 2011-12
instead of the base year 2004-05. The
revisions happen every 5 years.
● In India, Central Statistical Organisation
(1949) renamed as Central Statistical
Office (CSO) has been formulating
National Income.
■ National Income is the measurement of
the production power of an economic system
in a given time period.
■ National Wealth is the measurement of
the present assets available at a given time.
Methods of Measuring
National Income
Product Method
In this method, net value of final goods and
services produced in a country during a
year is obtained, which is called total final
product. This represents Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). Net income earned in
foreign boundaries by nationals is added
and depreciation is subtracted from GDP.
Income Method
In this method, a total of net income earned
by working people in different sectors and
commercial enterprises is obtained.
Incomes of both categories of people —
paying taxes and not paying taxes are added
to obtain national income. By income
method, national income is obtained by
adding receipts as total rent, total wages,
total interest and total profit.
Consumption Method
It is also called expenditure method. Income
is either spent on consumption or saved.
Hence, national income is the addition of
total consumption and total savings.
In India, a combination of production
method and income method is used for
estimating national income.
Estimates of National
Income in India
● In 1868, the first attempt was made by
Dadabhai Naoroji in his book ‘Poverty
and Un-British Rule in India’. He
estimated the per capita annual income
to be ` 20.
● The first scientific attempt to measure
national income in India was made by
professor VKRV Rao in 1931-32. He
divided the Indian economy into
13 sectors.
● In 1949, National Income Committee
under the Chairmanship of professor PC
Mahalanobis was constituted. The other
members were professor VKRV Rao and
professor DR Gadgil.
● The Government of India appointed a
National Income Committee under the
Chairmanship of Dr PC Mahalanobis.
This committee gave its first report in
1951 and final report New Series in 1954.
NATIONAL INCOME
AGGREGATES
Gross Domestic Product
(GDP)
It is the total money value of all final goods
and services produced within the
geographical boundaries of the country
during a given period of time.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 291
GDP = C + G + I
Where, C= Consumption expenditure
G = Government expenditure
I = Investment expenditure
But in closed economy, (R - P) = 0, then GDP = GNP where, (R - P) = Net factor income
from abroad.
GDP At Market Price
(GDP MP)
● It refers to the total value of all the goods and services at market price produced during
a year within the geographical boundaries of the country.
● Market price refers to the actual transacted price and it includes indirect taxes such as
Excise Duty, VAT, Service Tax, Customs Duty etc but it excludes government subsidies.
GDP at Factor Cost (GDPFC)
● GDP can be calculated at factor cost. This measure more accurately reveals the
income paid to factors of production.
● The factor cost means the total cost of all factors of production consumed or used in
producing a good or service. It includes government grants and subsidies, but it
excludes Indirect Taxes.
● The difference between Market Price (MP) and Cost Price (CP) is because of the
Indirect Taxes and Subsidies.
● GDPFC = GDP MP − Indirect Taxes + Subsidies
● In terms of value addition, the Gross Domestic Product of the economy is the sum total
of the net value added and depreciation of all the firms of the economy.
Calculation of GDP
● GDP in a country is usually calculated by the National Statistical Agency, which
compiles the information from a large number of sources.
● In case of India, it is Central Statistics Office (CSO), which estimates GDP. However,
most countries follow established international standards for calculating GDP of their
country.
● The international standards for measuring GDP are contained in the System of
National Accounts (SNA), 1993, compiled by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the European Commission (EC), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank.
Source Central Statistics Office
PE = Provisional Estimates (CSO)
Nominal GDP and Real GDP
Nominal GDP is evaluated at current market prices. Therefore, nominal GDP will
include all of the changes in market prices that have occurred during the current year
due to inflation or deflation.
Real GDP is a better measurement of GDP, since it reflects the increase in quantity of
goods and services by adjusting for any increase in prices. Real GDP is generally
measured by using base year prices of goods and services.
Gross Value Added (GVA)
● It is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or
sector of an economy. It national accounts, GVA is output minus intermediate
consumption, it is a balancing item of the national accounts’ production account.
● RBI dumps GVA model in August, 2018 and switches back to GDP to measure
economy.
292 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy
Gross National Product (GNP)
GNP refers to the money value of total
output of production of final goods and
services produced by the national
residents of a country during a given
period of time, generally a year.
Symbolically
GNP = GDP + (X − M) + (R − P)
GNP = C + G + I + (X − M) + (R − P)
X = Exports
M = Imports
(R−P) = Net factor income from abroad
Net National Product (NNP)
It is obtained by subtracting depreciation
value (i.e. capital stock consumption)
from GNP.
Symbolically,
NNP = GNP − Depreciation
National Income = NNP −Indirect taxes
+ Subsidies.
Personal Income (PI)
It is that income, which is actually
obtained by the individual or nationals.
Symbolically,
Personal Income = National Income +
Transfer Payments − Social Security
Contributions − Corportate Tax −
Undistributed Profits.
Personal Disposable
Income (PDI)
When personal direct taxes are
subtracted from personal income, the
obtained value is called personal
disposable income.
Symbolically,
PDI = PI − Direct taxes
National Statistical Organisation (NSO)
was set-up on 1st June, 2005, for
promoting statistical network in the
country. It was then headed by professor
SD Tendulkar. Gross Value Added (GVA)
is a measure in economics of the value of
goods and services produced in an area,
industry or sector of an economy.
GVA = GDP + Subsidies − (direct, sales)
taxes.
CSO and NSSO
■ CSO (Central Statistical Organisation) was
set-up in 1950, constituted to publish national
income data.
■ NSSO (National Sample Survey Organisation)
was set-up in 1950, for conducting large scale
sample survey to meet the data needs of the
country for the estimation of national income
and other aggregates.
■
In May 2019, Ministry of Statistics and
Programme Implementation has merged the
both CSO and NSSO in a single body named as
National Statistical Office.
Measurement of Growth

Human Development Report
The Human Development Report (HDR),
published by the UNDP since 1990, captures
the essence of human development. Human
development report rank countries based on
their ranking on Human Development Index
(HDI). HDI was devised by Pakistani
economist Mahbub ul Haq along with Indian
economist Amartya Sen.
In 2019 HDR, India has been placed at 129th

HPI measures the ecological efficiency with
which human well-being is delivered. It is
calculated by multiplying indices of life
satisfaction (estimated by compiling
responses to international surveys) and life
expectancy and dividing that product by
ecological footprint.

Planning Commission
■ Planning commission was formed on 15th
March, 1950, under the Chairmanship of Pt.
Jawaharlal Nehru. It was to formulate plans
for the economic development of the country
on the basis of the available physical,
capital and human resources.
■ Planning commission was dissolved on

established NITI Aayog (National Institution
for Transforming India) to replace planning
commission.
National Development
Council (NDC)

STRATEGIES
OF PLANNING
Harrod-Domar Strategy
● First Five Year Plan was based on this
strategy.
● This strategy emphasised the role of
capital accumulation’s dual character,
which on the one hand increases the
national income (demand side role) and
on the other hand increases the
production capacity (supply side role).
Nehru-Mahalanobis Strategy
● Second Five Year Plan was based on this
strategy.
● Based on Russian experience, this strategy
is a two sector model, i.e. consumer good
sector and capital good sector.
● The strategy emphasised investment in
heavy industry to achieve industrialisation
for rapid economic development.
Gandhian Strategy
● It was enunciated by Acharya SN Agarwal
in his ‘Gandhian Plan’ in 1944. The basic
objective of the Gandhian Model is to
raise the material as well as cultural level
of the masses so as to provide basic
standard of life.
LPG Strategy
● Liberalisation, Privatisation and
Globalisation (LPG) strategy of planning
was introduced by the Finance Minister
of that time, Dr Manmohan Singh under
Narsimha Rao Government. The strategy
ended the ‘license permit raj’ and opened
the hitherto areas reserved for the public
sector to private sector.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 295
PURA Strategy
● PURA stands for providing Urban amenities in rural areas and was the brainchild of
APJ Abdul Kalam.
● This strategy emphasises on three connectivities—physical, electronic, knowledge and
thereby leading to economic connectivity to enhance the prosperity of cluster of
villages in rural areas.

● Poverty is a social phenomenon where few
section of society is unable to fulfil even basic
necessities of life.
● Planning Commission (Now, NITI Aayog) is
the authority, which publishes the poverty
estimates based on various rounds of National
Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) on
monthly per capita consumption expenditure.
In India, traditionally the poverty line was
defined on the basis of calorie intake.
According to this, 2100 calories a day has
been fixed for urban areas and 2400 calories
in rural areas.
● However, this methodology was changed
considering other requirements of the poors
such as housing, clothing and education etc.
The current estimation of poverty are based
upon the recommendation of Suresh
Tendulkar Committee (2005) that
recommended to shift away from the calorie
based model.
● It stipulated a benchmark daily per capita
expenditure of ` 27 and ` 33 in rural and urban
areas respectively to arrive at a poverty line.
Causes of Rural Poverty
● Rapid Population growth
● Lack of capital
● Lack of alternate employment
opportunities other than
agriculture
● Excessive population pressure on
agriculture
● Illiteracy
● Regional disparities
● Joint family system
● Child marriage
● Lack of proper implementation of
PDS (Public Distribution System)
Causes of Urban Poverty
● Migration from rural areas
● Lack of skilled labour
● Lack of housing facilities
● Limited job opportunities in cities
● Lack of vocational education/
training

Poverty and its Study
in India
Various economists and organisations have
studied the extent of poverty in India. Some
of them are as follows:
Dandekar and Rath’s Study of
Poverty in India
Dr VM Dandekar and Mr Nilkantha Rath
estimated the value of the diet with 2250
calories as the desired minimum level of
nutrition.
They estimated that in 1968-69 about 40%
of the rural population and a little more
than 50% of the urban population lived
below the poverty line.
Montek Singh Ahluwalia’s Study
of Rural Poverty (1977)
MS Ahluwalia studied the trends in
incidence of rural poverty in India for the
period 1956-57 to 1973-74. He used the
concept of poverty line, i.e. an expenditure
level of ` 15 in 1960-61 for rural areas and
` 20 per person for urban areas.
Estimate of Poverty by the
Seventh Finance Commission
(1978)
The Seventh Finance Commission made
an attempt to have a more inclusive
concept of poverty line.
Since, the NSS data cover only household
consumer expenditure, thus, to get a more
inclusive measure of welfare or
deprivation, an estimate of the benefit of
public expenditure was added to private
consumer expenditure norm for
calculating the augmented poverty line.
Tendulkar Committee
Report
This committee moved away from just
calorie criterion definition to a broader
definition of poverty that also includes
expenditure on health, education, clothing
in addition to food. According to this report,
41.8% population in rural areas and 25.7%
population in urban areas was living below
poverty line.
Rangarajan Report on
Poverty
The expert group under the Chairmanship
of Dr C Rangarajan to review the
Methodology for measurement of poverty
in the country constituted by the Planning
Commission in June, 2012 has submitted
its report on 30th June, 2014. The report
retained consumption expenditure
estimates of NSSO as the basis for
determining poverty. On the basis of this, it
pegged the total number of poor in India at
363 million or 29.6% of the population.
This is higher than 269.8 million poor
people or 21.9% pegged by the Suresh
Tendulkar Committee.
Highlights of the Report
The highlights of the report are as follows:
(i) The daily per capita expenditure is
pegged at ` 32 for the rural poor and at
` 47 for the urban poor.
(ii) Poverty line based on the average
monthly per capita expenditure is
pegged at ` 972 for rural areas and
` 1407 for urban areas.
(iii) The percentage of people below the
poverty line in 2011-12 was 30.95 in
rural areas and 26.4 in urban areas.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 303
Unemployment
Unemployment in India
Unemployment refers to a situation,
when a person is able and willing to work
at the prevailing wage rate, but doesn’t get
the opportunity to work. Unemployment
is often used as a measure of the health of
the economy. The most frequently cited
measure of unemployment is
unemployment rate. That is the number
of unemployed persons divided by the
number of people in the labour force.
Estimation of
Unemployment
● B Bhagwati Committee on unemployment estimates (1973) set-up by the
Planning Commission gave three
estimates of unemployment.
These are as follows:
■ Usual Principal Status (UPS)
Persons who remained unemployed
for a major part of the year. This is
also called ‘open unemployment’.
■ Current Weekly Status (CWS)
A person is considered to be
employed if he or she pursues any
one or more of the gainful activities
for at least one hour on any day of
the reference week.
■ Current Daily Status (CDS)
Persons who did not find work on a
day or some days during the
survey week. This is the
comprehensive measure of
unemployment, including chronic as
well as underemployment.
TYPES OF
UNEMPLOYMENT
Generally, unemployment can be
classified into two types
Voluntary Unemployment
This type of unemployment is on account
of people not interested to take the
employment i.e. jobs are available but the
persons are not interested in being
employed.
It is psychological in nature. Therefore, such
types of persons are not included in the
category of unemployed.
Involuntary Unemployment
It refers to a situation in which the persons
are interested to work but the jobs are not
available. Such persons are included in the
categories of unemployed persons. It is also
called open employment.
Cyclical Unemployment
This type of unemployment is due to the
recession in the economy. During recession,
there is less requirement of man-power on
account of the decrease in the level of
economic activities and thus causes cyclical
unemployment. This type of unemployment
is prevalent in the developed countries. This
is also known as Keynesian Unemployment.
Frictional Unemployment
This type of unemployment is caused by
people taking time out of work, being
between jobs or looking for a job.
The one cause of its evolution is decline of
one industry and rise of the other and labour
take some time before moving to the other
industry. This type of unemployment is
short-term in nature.
Seasonal Unemployment
It is an account of the seasonal nature of the
productive activities, i.e., some productive
activities are carried out only for certain
duration of a year. Therefore, the persons
employed in such activities are unemployed
during off-season. This, generally, occurs in
agro-based industries.
Disguised Unemployment
It is a situation, in which more persons are
employed to do a job which can be done with
equal efficiency by less number of workers.
Structural Unemployment
It refers to a mismatch of job vacancies with
the supply of labour available, caused by
shifts in the structure of the economy.
304 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 305
Structural joblessness results from things like skills mismatches and policy to address
such mismatches is inherently longer term in scope, involving education and
encouraging innovation.
Technological Unemployment
Technology has always displaced some work and jobs. Thus, technological
unemployment is a term used to describe the lack or loss of jobs due to technological
changes or innovations. This type of unemployment typically comes from workers either
being replaced by machines or having their jobs made easier and require fewer workers to
accomplish the same task. It is one of the reasons of jobless growth.

goods are accorded weights depending on
their relative significance.

pressures caused by expansion and
contraction of credit.

● Bank Rate It is also called the
rediscount rate. It is the rate, at which
the RBI gives finance to Commercial
Banks. It is currently at 9%.
● Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) It specifies
the fraction of the total deposits of banks
that they are obliged to keep with the
RBI. Since 1962, the RBI has been
empowered to vary the CRR
requirement between 3% and 15% of the
total demand and time deposits.
● Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) It is
the ratio of liquid asset, which all
Commercial Banks have to keep in the
form of cash, gold or government
approved securities before providing
credit to its customers. SLR rate is
determined and maintained by RBI in
order to control the expansion of the
bank credit.
● Repo Rate It was introduced in
December 1992. It is the rate, at which
RBI lends short-term money to the banks
against securities.
● Reverse Repo Rate It is the rate, at

is always 100 base point 1% less than
Repo rate.

the market, it withdraws money
liquidity from the market and thus,
reduces volume of credit leading to
control of inflation.

sure that purpose, for which loan is
given is not misused. It is done
through

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Indian Economy 337
It refers to the management of revenue and
capital expenditure finances of the state.
Hence, Fiscal system includes budgetary
activities of the government that is revenue
raising, borrowing and spending activities.
FISCAL POLICY
It is the means by which a govrnment
adjusts its spending levels and tax rates to
monitor and influence a nations economy. It
is the sister strategy to Monetary Policy
through which a Central Bank influences a
nations money supply.
These uses can affect the following macro
economic variables in an economy
● Aggregate demand and the level of
economic activity;
● The distribution of income;
● The pattern of resource allocation within
the government sector and relative to the
private sector.
Sources of Revenue
Main sources of revenue are customs duties,
excise duties, service tax, taxes on property,
corporate tax, income taxes.
Sources of Expenditure
Plan Expenditure includes agriculture,
rural development, irrigation and flood
control, energy, industry, minerals,
transport and communications etc.
Non-Plan Expenditure It consists of
interest payments, defence, subsidies and
general services.
Public Debt
● Internal Debt It comprises loans raised
from the open market treasury bills issued
to the RBI, Commercial Banks etc.
● External Debt It consists of loans taken
from World Bank, IMF, ADB and
individual countries.
Deficits
In a budget statement, four types of deficits
are mentioned
(a) Revenue (b) Capital
(c) Fiscal (d) Primary
Revenue Deficit
There are various ways to represent and
interpret a government’s deficit. The
simplest is the revenue deficit which is just
the difference between revenue receipts
and revenue expenditures.
Revenue deficit = Revenue expenditure
− Revenue receipts
Capital Deficit
An imbalance in a nation’s balance of
payments capital account in which
payments made by the country for
purchasing foreign assets exceed
payments received by the country for
selling domestic assets.
In other words, investment by the
domestic economy in foreign assets is less
than foreign investment in domestic
assets. This is generally not a desirable
situation for a domestic economy.
Capital deficit = Capital receipts
− Disbursement on capital account
Fiscal Deficit
This is the sum of revenue and capital
expenditure less all revenue and capital
receipts other than loans taken.
This gives a more holistic view of the
government’s funding situation since it
gives the difference between all receipts
and expenditures other than loans taken
to meet such expenditures.
Fiscal Deficit = Difference between
country’s expenditure and earnings
Fiscal deficit = Revenue receipts (Net tax
revenue + Non-tax revenue) + Capital
receipts (only recoveries of loans and
other receipts) – Total expenditure (Plan
and non-plan).
Primary Deficit
Amount by which a government’s total
expenditure exceeds its total revenue,
excluding interest payments on its debt.
Primary deficit = Fiscal deficit − Interest
payments.

part of budget) is passed by end of April, but
government needs money from beginning of
financial year, so government use
vote-on-account to remove money from
consolidated fund of India.
Types of Budgeting
Line Item Budgeting
If emphasises on the items (objects) of
expenditure without highlighting its purpose. It
gives object-wise (Line-item) classification in

PHYSICS
GENERAL
SCIENCE
Physics is the study of nature and its laws. The word physics has been derived from a
Greek word physis which means nature. Physics is one of the academic disciplines,
perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy.
Units
Measurement of any physical quantity
involves comparison with a certain basic
arbitrarily chosen and widely accepted
reference standard called unit.
SI SYSTEM
It is based on the following seven basic
units and two supplementary units

Dimensions of Physical
Quantities
Dimensions of a physical quantity are the
powers, to which the fundamental
quantities must be raised to represent that
quantity completely. There fore, the
dimensional formula of a quantity is
expressed in terms of fundamental
quantities, commonly mass M, length L and
time T. Any physical quantity is either a
scalar or a vector.
e.g. Force =
−
[ ] MLT 2
, Density =
−
[ ] ML 3
Scalar Quantities
Physical quantities which have magnitude
only and no direction are called scalar
quantities. e.g. mass, speed, volume, work,
time, power, energy etc.
Vector Quantities
Physical quantities which have both
magnitude and direction and also obey
triangle law of vector addition are called
vector quantities.
e.g. displacement, velocity, acceleration,
force, momentum, torque etc.
KINEMATICS
It is the branch of mechanics, which deals
with the motion of object.
Distance
● The length of the actual path covered by a
body in a particular time interval is called
distance. It is always positive.
● It is a scalar quantity.
● Its unit is metre.
Displacement
● The difference between the final and the
initial position of an object is called
displacement. It may be positive,
negative or zero.
● It is a vector quantity. Its unit is metre.
● The magnitude of displacement may or
may not be equal to the path length
traversed by an object.
Displacement ≤ Distance
Speed
● Speed is the distance covered by a
moving body in per unit of time interval.
● It is a scalar quantity. It is always equal to
or greater than magnitude of the velocity.
● The average speed of a particle for a
given interval of time is defined as the
ratio of total distance travelled to the
total time taken.

● If a body is moving on a circular path,
then after completing one complete
cycle, its average velocity is zero.
Uniform Velocity
An object is said to be moving with uniform
velocity if it undergoes equal
displacements in equal intervals of time.
Non-Uniform Velocity
An object is said to be moving with nonuniform or variable velocity if it undergoes
unequal displacements in equal intervals
of time.
Relative Velocity
When two bodies are moving in the straight
line, the speed (or velocity) of one with
respect to another is known as its relative
speed (or velocity).
v
AB = velocity of A with respect to B
= − v v A B
Acceleration
● It is the rate of change of velocity. Its SI
unit is m s/ 2
. It is a vector quantity.
● When the velocity of a body increases
with time then its acceleration is positive
and if velocity decreases with time then
its acceleration is negative and is called
retardation or deceleration.
● Acceleration of an object is zero, if
it is at rest or moving with uniform
velocity.

MOTION/REST
If the position of a body or a system of
bodies does not change with time, it is
said to be at rest.
On the other hand, if the position change
with time, it is said to be in motion.
A particle in rest does not have the speed
and acceleration, while a particle in the
motion has its speed and also may have
some acceleration, if the speed changes
with respect to time.

rectangular co-ordinate axis.
Projectile Motion
● When a particle is projected so that it
makes certain angle with horizontal then
the motion of the particle is said to be
projectile. Path of a projectile is parabolic
in nature.
● The initial velocity u of the projectile can
be resolved into two components
(i) u cos θ (horizontal direction)
(ii) u sin θ (vertical direction)

● For maximum range θ = ° 45 .
Therefore, a long jumper takes
jump at an angle of 45°.
● For maximum height θ = ° 90 .
● The horizontal range is the same
when the body is projected at θ or
(90° – θ).
● When a body is dropped freely
from the top of the tower and
another body is projected
horizontally from the same point,
both will reach the ground at the
same time.
● When two balls of different
masses are projected horizontally
they will reach ground at same
time.
Circular Motion
● When an object moves along a
circular path, then its motion is
called circular motion e.g. motion
of top etc. If an object moves along
a circular path with uniform
speed, its motion is called uniform
circular motion. It is accelerated
even if the speed of the body is
constant. The motion of a satellite
is an accelerated motion.
● The acceleration is directed
towards the centre and is given by
a
v
r
=
2
, where v is the speed and r
is the radius. This is called
centripetal acceleration.
FORCE
Force is a push or pull which can change the
position or direction of a body.
Centripetal Force
A body performing circular motion is acted upon
by a force which is always directed towards the
centre of the circle. This force is called centripetal
force. Any of the forces found in nature (such as
frictional force, gravitational force, electrical
force, magnetic force etc) may act as a centripetal
force.
● Cyclist bends his body towards the centre on a
turn while turning to obtain the required
centripetal force.
● Generally, in rain the scooter slips at the
turning of a road because the friction between
tyre and road is reduced. Due to this, necessary
centripetal force is not provided. Roads are
banked at turns to provide the required
centripetal force for taking a turn.
Centrifugal Force
Pseudo Force When we in a non-inertial frame of
reference to apply Newton’s laws, we have to apply
a force on the object equal to mass times in
opposite direction of acceleration or retardation of
the frame. Centrifugal force is such a Pseudo
force. It is always equal and opposite to centripetal
force.
Cream separator, centrifugal drier etc work on the
principle of centrifugal force.
NEWTON’S LAWS
OF MOTION
First Law
● “Every body retains its state of rest or state of
uniform motion, until an external force is
applied on it.” This law is also known as law of
inertia or law of Galileo.
● First law gives the definition of inertia. Inertia
is the virtue of a body due to which it tries to
retain its state.
Inertia is of three types
Inertia of rest
Inertia of motion
Inertia of direction
● A person sitting in a moving car falls forward,
when the car stops suddenly. This is because
the feet of the passenger comes to the rest along
with the car, but the upper part of his body,
tends to remain in motion due to inertia of
motion.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 351
● The dust particle come out from a
carpet, when it is beaten with a stick
due to their inertia of rest.
● Inertial Frame Whenever the frame of
reference is moving with uniform
velocity or is at rest.
● Non-Inertial Frame Whenever the
frame of reference is accelerating or
retarding or rotating is called noninertial frame of reference.
Second Law
● ‘‘The force applied on a body is equal
to the product of mass of the body
and the acceleration produced in it
e.g. F ma = .’’
● The second law of motion gives the
definition of force.
● A force is any influence that causes an
object to undergo a certain change,
either concerning its movement,
direction and geometrical structure.
● SI unit of force is Newton (N).
Linear Momentum
● The product of the mass and the
velocity of a body is called the linear
momentum of the body.
● It is a vector quantity. Its unit is kg-m/s.
∴Linear momentum = × Mass Velocity
● A heavier body has a larger linear
momentum than a lighter body moving
with the same velocity.
● In the absence of external forces, the
total linear momentum of the system
remains conserved.
Application of Conservation of
Linear Momentum
● When a man jumps from a boat to the
shore, the boat slightly moves away
from the shore. Rocket works on the
principle of conservation of
momentum.
● When a bullet is fired from a gun, the
gun recoils or gives a sharp pull in
backward direction.
Impulse
● If a force acts on a body for a very short
time ∆t, then the product of force and
time is called the impulse.
● Impulse = Change in momentum
= × Force Time interval
● Its SI unit is N-s or kg-m/s.
Concept of Impulse
■ A cricketer moves his hands backwards while
catching a ball.
■ A person jumping from a height on a ‘concrete’
floor receives more injury than when jumping
on a spongy floor.
■ Vehicles like cars, buses and scooters are
provided with shockers.
■ Bogies of the trains are provided with buffers to
avoid severe jerks during shunting of trains.
Buffers increase the time-duration of jerks
during shunting. This reduces the force with
which bogies push or pull each other and thus
severe jerks are avoided.
Third Law
● “Every action have equal and opposite
reaction.” Action and reaction always act
on the different bodies.
● On firing the bullet, the gunner is pushed
in backward direction.
● When the boatman is jumped from the
boat, the boat is pushed back.
● In a rocket, gases are ejected with a great
speed from the rocket backwards and
rocket is pushed forwards.
● While swimming, a person pushes the
water backwards (action). The water
pushes the swimmer forward with the
same force (reaction).
Equilibrium
● If the resultant of all the forces acting on a
body is zero, then the body is said to be in
equilibrium. If a body is in equilibrium, it
will be either at rest or in uniform motion.
If it is at rest, the equilibrium is called
static, otherwise dynamic.
● Static equilibrium is of the following two
types
(i) Stable Equilibrium If on slight
displacement from equilibrium
position a body has tendency to regain
its original position, it is said to be in
stable equilibrium.
352 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
(ii) Unstable Equilibrium If on a slight displacement from equilibrium position, a
body moves in the direction of displacement and does not regain its original
position, the equilibrium is said to be unstable equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the
centre of gravity of the body is at the highest position.
Neutral Equilibrium
If on slight displacement from equilibrium position a body has no tendency to come back
to its original position or to move in the direction of displacement, it is said to be in
neutral equilibrium.
● In neutral equilibrium, the centre of gravity always remains at the same height.
Condition for Stable Equilibrium
For stable equilibrium of a body, the following two conditions should be fulfilled
(i) The centre of gravity of the body should be at the minimum height.
(ii) The vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the body should pass through
the base of the body.
Centre of Mass Centre of mass of a body (system of particles) is a point where the entire
mass of the body is supposed to be concentrated. We can define position of centre of mass

are position vectors of constituent particles.
FRICTION
● If we slide or try to slide a body over a surface, the motion is resisted by a bonding
between the body and the surface. This resistance is called frictional force.
● The opposite force that comes into play when one body tends to move over the surface
of another body but actually motion has yet not started is called static friction.
● The maximum value of the static frictional force which comes into play when a body
just begins to slide over the surface of another body is called limiting frictional force.
● When two bodies actually roll on each other (as in case of ball bearing), the rolling
friction comes into play.
● When two bodies actually slide over each other, sliding friction comes into play.
● When a body moves over the other body, then the force of friction acting between two
surfaces in contact in relative motion is called Kinetic Friction.
● µ µ µ s r > >κ
, here µ ,µs κ
and µr
are called coefficient of static, kinetic and rolling friction
respectively.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Friction
● Walking is possible due to friction.
● The transfer of motion from one part of a machine to other part through belts is
possible by friction.
● Brake works on the basis of friction.
● Friction causes wear and tear of the parts of machinery in contact. Thus, their lifetime
gets reduced.
Methods of Reducing Friction
● By polishing, by lubrication, by proper selection of material and by using ball bearing
friction can be reduced to some extent.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 353
Work, Energy and Power
WORK
When a body is displaced by applying a
force on it, then work is said to be done. If a
body is displaced by a distance s on
applying a force F on it, then work done
W F s Fs = ⋅ = cos , θ where ‘θ’ is the angle
between the force and the direction of
displacement. It is a scalar quantity. Its unit
is joule (J).
Positive Work Done
● Positive work means that force is applied
along the direction of displacement. e.g.
when a horse pulls a cart on a level road,
when a body falls freely under
gravitational pull.
Negative Work Done
Negative work means that force is opposite
to displacement. e.g. when a positive
charge is moved towards another positive
charge, when a body is made to slide over a
rough surface.
Zero Work Done
If the force is perpendicular to the
displacement and if either the force or the
displacement is zero, work done is zero. e.g.
when a body is moved along a circular path
with the help of a string, when a coolie
travels on a platform with a load on his
head and when a person does not move
from his position but he may be holding any
amount of heavy load.
ENERGY
● It is defined as capacity of doing work. Its
unit is joule in SI and erg in CGS system.
● Mechanical energy is in two forms;
kinetic energy and potential energy.
Kinetic Energy
● It is the energy possessed by a body by
virtue of its motion.
● If a body of mass m is moving with
velocity v, then kinetic energy
KE = mv

where, p is the linear momentum.
● When momentum is doubled, kinetic
energy becomes four times.
● Kinetic energy of air is used to run wind
mills.
● Kinetic energy of running water is used
to run the water mills.
● A bullet fired from a gun can pierce a
target due to its kinetic energy.
● If a body is moving in horizontal circle
then its kinetic energy is same at all
points, but if it is moving in vertical
circle, then the kinetic energy is
different at different points.
Potential Energy
● It is the energy possessed by a body by
virtue of its position.
● Suppose a body is raised to a height h
above the surface of the earth, then
potential energy of the body = mgh.
● When a body is falling downwards, then
its potential energy goes on changing to
kinetic energy.
● The potential energy of the wound
spring of a clock is used to drive the
hands of the clock.
● The potential energy of water in dams
is used to run turbines in order to
produce electric energy using the
generators.
Conservative and
Non-conservative Forces
A non-dissipative force is known as
conservative force e.g. gravitational force,
electrostatic force. Non-conservative
forces are dissipative forces e.g. frictional
forces, viscous force.
Law of Conservation of Energy
● According to the law of conservation
of energy, ‘‘Energy can neither be
created nor be destroyed but it can only
be transformed from one form to
another.”
● The sum of all kinds of energies in an
isolated system remains constant at all
times.
354 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Transformation of Energy
● In a heat engine, heat energy changes
into mechanical energy.
● In the electric bulb, the electric energy
is converted into light energy.
● In burning coil, oil etc., the chemical
energy changes into heat energy.
● In solar cell, solar energy changes into
electrical energy.

changes into sound energy.
● In battery, chemical energy changes
into mechanical energy.
● In electric motor, electrical energy
changes into mechanical energy.
● In candle, chemical energy changes
into light and heat energy.
POWER
● Rate of doing work by a body is called
power.
i.e. Power =
Work done
Time taken
P
W
t
=
● SI unit of power is watt (W) or joule per
second and it is a scalar quantity.
1 W = 1 J/s
1 kW = 103 W
1 MW = 106 W
1 Horse Power (HP) = 746 W
1 watt/second (W-s) = 1J
1 watt/hour (W-h) = 3600 J
1 kilowatt hour (kW-h) = × 3.6 106
J
Torque
● The turning effect of a force on a body
is known as the moment of the force or
torque. Torque is a vector quantity.
i.e. Torque, Z F. d =
Where, F = force
d = perpendicular distance of force from
the axis of rotation.
Simple Machines

It is based on moment of force.
■ Lever, inclined plane, screw guage etc. are
simple machine.
■ Scissors, sea saw, brakes of cycle, hand pump,
plass are lever of first kind.
■ Nut cracker and waste carrying machine are
lever of second kind.
■ Tong, man’s hand and tiller are lever of third
kind.
GRAVITATION
In 1686, Newton stated that in the universe
each particle of matter attracts every other
particle. This universal attractive force is called
gravitation.
Gravitational Force
● It is always attractive in nature.
● It is the weakest force but is a long range
force.
● Mathematically it is represented as
F
GMm
r
G =
2
where, FG
is gravitational force, G is
gravitational constant, M is the mass of first
particle, m is the mass of second particle
and r is the distance between them.
● This is called Newton’s universal law of
gravitation.
● The value of G is 6.67 10 N m / kg 11 2 2 ×
−
-
Gravity
● It is the force by which the Earth attracts
a body towards its centre.
● The acceleration due to gravity is the rate of
increase of velocity of a body falling freely
towards the Earth. It is represented by
g
GM
R
e
e
=
2
where, Me
is the mass of the Earth and Re
is
the radius of Earth.
● The value of g at the surface of Earth is
9.8 m/ s2
.
● The Earth is surrounded by an
atmosphere of gases due to gravity. The
value of g on the Moon is 1/6th of that on
the Earth surface.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 355
Variation in the Value of g
● When we go above the surface of the
Earth, the acceleration due to gravity
goes on decreasing.
● When we go below the surface of the
Earth, the acceleration due to gravity
goes on decreasing and becomes zero
at the centre of the Earth.
● Decreasing the rotational motion of
Earth, the value of g increases.
● When we go from the equator towards
the poles, the value of g goes on
increasing.
● If Earth stops its rotation about its own
axis, then at the equator the value of g
increases and consequently the weight
of body lying there increases.
● The value of g is maximum on the
surface of the Earth.
Centre of Gravity
● The centre of gravity of a body is that
point at which the whole weight of the
body appears to act.
● It can be inside the material of the
body or outside it.
● For regularly shaped body, the centre
of gravity lies at its geometrical
centre.
Mass
● The mass of a body is the quantity of
matter contained in it.It is a scalar
quantity and its SI unit is kg.
● Mass is measured by an ordinary
equal arm balance.
● Mass of body does not change from
place-to-place and remains constant.
Weight
● The weight of a body is the force with,
which it is attracted towards the
centre of the Earth. It is a vector
quantity and its SI unit is Newton
(N).
● It is measured by a spring balance.
● It is not constant and it changes from
place to place.
Weight of a Body in a Lift
■
If lift is stationary or moving with uniform speed
(either upward or downward), the apparent
weight of a body is equal to its true weight.
■
If lift is going up with an acceleration, the
apparent weight of a body is more than the true
weight. If lift is going down with an acceleration,
the apparent weight of a body is less than the
true weight.
■
If the cord of the lift is broken, then it falls freely.
In this situation, the weight of a body in the lift
becomes zero. This is the situation of
weightlessness.
■ While going down, if the acceleration of lift is
more than acceleration due to gravity, a body in
the lift goes in contact of the ceiling of lift.
SATELLITE
● The heavenly body which revolves around
the planets is called satellite. Moon is a
natural satellite of Earth.
● The speed of a satellite does not depend
upon the mass of the satellite.
● A satellite revolving very close to Earth’s
surface has a period of revolution about 84
min and its speed is nearly 8 km/s.
● Every body inside the satellite is in a state of
weightlessness. Total energy of the satellite
is negative.
● Artificial satellites are of two types
Geostationary and Polar satellites
(i) The satellite whose time period is 24 h, is
called geostationary satellite. It is used
to reflect TV signals and telecast TV
programs from one part of the world to
another. This satellite revolves around
the Earth at a height of 36000 km.
INSAT-2B and INSAT-2C are
geostationary satellites of India.
(ii) Polar satellites revolve around the
earth in polar orbits at a height of
approximately 800 km. The time period
of these satellites is approximately 84
minute. These satellites are used in
weather forecasting, in studying upper
region of the atmosphere, in mapping
etc. PSLV Series Satellites are Polar
Satellites of India.
356 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Escape Velocity
● The minimum velocity that should be
given to the body to enable it to
escape away from Earth’s
gravitational field is called escape
velocity. It is given by
v
acceleration
due to gravity Radius of
theEarth
e =
×
×
2
Its value on the Earth’s surface is
11.2 km/s.
● The value of the escape velocity of a
body does not depend on its mass. Its
value on the moon surface is
2.38 km/s. So, there is no
atmosphere around the moon.
● Escape velocity is 2times the orbital
velocity.
● Satellites are launched with the
escape velocity as needed.
Kepler’s Laws
● All planets move around the Sun in elliptical
orbits having the Sun at one foci of the orbit.
● The areal speed of a planet around the Sun
is constant.
● The square of the period of revolution ( ) T of
any planet around the Sun is directly
proportional to the cube of its mean distance
from the Sun (a) i.e. T a 2 3 ∝ .
Quick Digest
■ The Earth rotates on its axis from West to East.
This rotation makes the Sun and the stars appear
to be moving across the sky from East to West.
■ The response of plants to gravity is called
geotropism.
■ We are able to see a live telecast of cricket
matches or other programmes with the help of a
communication satellite, which is a
geostationary satellite.

General Properties of Matter
Matter It is the substance that occupies
definite space and mass which is perceptible
to sense.
ELASTICITY
● It is that property of the material body by
virtue of which the body opposes any
change in its shape or size when deforming
forces are applied to it, and recovers its
original state as soon as the deforming
forces are removed.
● Steel is more elastic than rubber.
● Elastic Limit The maximum limit of the
external force upto which elasticity of the
body is maintained.
Plasticity
● The property of a body by virtue of which it
does not regain its original configuration
even after the removal of deforming force
is called plasticity.
● Putty, paraffin wax are nearly perfectly
plastic bodies.
Stress
The internal restoring force acting per unit
area of cross-section of the deformed body is
called stress. Its unit is N m2
/ or pascal.
Strain
● The change in length, volume, shape
of the body per unit of the original
value under the application of the
deforming force is called strain. Strain
is unit less quantity.
● Hooke's law and Modulus of
Elasticity The ratio of stress to strain
is a constant for the material and is
called modulus of elasticity.
E =
Stress
Strain
● It is also called Hooke’s law, which
states that within the limit of elasticity
the strain produced in a body is directly
proportional to the stress applied to it.
● Young’s Modulus If strain is
longitudinal, then the modulus of
elasticity is called Young’s modulus.
● Bulk Modulus If under the effect of
uniform pressure, the volume of the
body changes it is called the bulk
modulus of elasticity.
● Modulus of Rigidity The ratio of
tangential stress to shearing strain is
called modulus of rigidity.
MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS
PRESSURE
● It is defined as force acting normally on unit
area of the surface.
Pressure =
Normal force
Area
● Its unit is N m/
2
also called pascal. It is a
scalar quantity.
● Pressure in a liquid is given by p h g = ρ
where, h is the height, (ρ) is density of the
liquid and g is acceleration due to gravity.
● Atmospheric pressure of 1 atm
= × 1.01 10 N/m 5 2
= 760 torr
● Atmospheric pressure decreases with
altitude. This is why (i) it is difficult to cook
on the mountain, (ii) the fountain pen of a
passenger leaks in aeroplane at height.
● Atmospheric pressure is measured by
barometer. The slow rise in the barometric
reading is the indication of clear weather.
● Sudden fall in barometric reading is the
indication of storm.
● Slow fall in barometric reading is the
indication of rain.
DENSITY AND
RELATIVE DENSITY
● The density of a substance (ρ) is defined as
the ratio of its mass (M) to its volume (V).
i.e. Density Mass
Volume
=
Its unit is kg/ m3
.
● Density of water is maximum at 4°C.
● The relative density is defined as the ratio
of the density of the substance to the
density of water at 4° C i.e.
Relative density
=
°
Density of substance
Density of water at 4 C
● Relative density has no unit.
● Relative density is measured by hydrometer.
● Ice floats on water surface as its density
(0.92 g/cm3
) is lesser than the density of
water (1 g/cm3
).
● The density of human body is less than the
density of water but the density of head is
greater than the density of water.
● Therefore, during swimming a person
displaces the water with hands and
legs and thus total weight of displaced
water becomes equal to the weight of
the body.
● If ice floating in water in a vessel
melts, the level of water in the vessel
does not change.
● The density of sea water is more than
that of normal water. This explains
why it is easier to swim in sea water.
Pascal’s Law
● The pressure exerted anywhere at a
point of confined fluid is transmitted
equally and undiminished in all
directions throughout the liquid.
● Hydraulic lift, hydraulic press,
hydraulic brake work on the basis of
Pascal’s law.
BUOYANCY
● The upward force exerted by a fluid on
the immersed body is called buoyant
force or upthrust. The upthrust acts at
the centre of gravity of the liquid
displaced by the submerged part of the
body that is called the centre of
buoyancy.
● Buoyant force depends on the density
of the fluid and not on the density of
body and acts on centre of gravity of
displaced fluid.
Archimedes’ Principle
● When a solid body is immersed wholly
or partially in a liquid, then there is
some apparent loss in its weight. This
loss in weight is equal to the weight of
the liquid displaced by the body.
Law of Floatation
● Whenever a solid body is dipped into a
fluid, the fluid exerts force of
buoyancy on it, if the force of
buoyancy equals to weight of the solid,
the solid will remain in equilibrium.
This is called floatation.
● If density of material of body is equal
to density of liquid, the body floats
fully submerged in liquid in neutral
equilibrium.
358 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
● When body floats in neutral
equilibrium, the weight of the body is
equal to the weight of displaced
liquid. The centre of gravity of the
body and centre of gravity of the
displaced liquid should be on one
vertical line for the condition.
SURFACE
TENSION ( )T
● It is the force (F) acting normally to
an unit length (l) of an imaginary line
drawn on the surface of liquid.
i.e. T
F
l
=
● Its unit is N/m.
● Cohesive force It is the
intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of the
same substance.
● Adhesive force It is the
intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of
different substance.
● The surface tension decreases with
rise in temperature and becomes zero
at the critical temperature.
● Due to the surface tension, rain drops
are spherical in shape.
■ Warm soup is tasty because at
high temperature its surface
tension is low and consequently
the soup spreads on all part of the
tongue.
■ When kerosene oil is sprinkled on
water, its surface tension
decreases.
Some Phenomena Based on
Surface Tension
● Small drops of mercury are
spherical, while large ones are flat.
● Formation of lead shots.
● Floatation of needle on water.
● Dancing of camphor on water.
● Bigger bubbles can be formed from
the soap solution easily than from
water.
● Detergent helps in cleaning the
clothes.
CAPILLARITY
● Capillary tube A long glass tube of very fine
(hair like) bore is called capillary tube.
● The phenomenon of rise or fall of liquids in a
capillary tube is called capillarity.
● The liquids which wet glass and for which
the angle of contact is acute rise up in the
capillary tube, while those which do not wet
glass, for which the angle of contact is
obtuse are fall down in the capillary tube.
Note The angle of contact is zero for pure water
and clean glass. It is 90° for water and
silver, 8° for ordinary water and glass and
135° for mercury and glass.
Some Practical Examples of
Capillarity
■ The kerosene oil in a lantern and the melted
wax in a candle, rise in the capillaries formed in
the cotton wick and thus they are burnt.
■ Writing nib is split in the middle so that a fine
capillary is formed in it. When it is dipped in ink
the ink rises in the capillary.
■ The water given to the fields rises in the
innumerable capillaries formed in the stems of
plants and trees and reaches the branches and
the leaves.
■ The farmers plough their fields after rains so
that the capillaries formed in the soil are broken
and the water remains in the lower layers of the
soil.
VISCOSITY
● It is the property of the liquid by virtue of
which it opposes the relative motion
between its adjacent layers.
● Viscosity of an ideal fluid is zero.
● Viscosity is the property of both liquids and
gases. With rise in temperature, viscosity of
liquids decreases and that for gases
increases.
● Viscosity of gases is much less than that of
liquids.
● Viscosity of liquid increases with increase in
pressure.
● Viscosity of a fluid is measured by
its coefficient of viscosity. Its SI unit is
(N sm−2
) or pascal-second (Pa-s).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 359
Terminal Velocity
● When a body falls in a viscous medium, its
velocity first increases and finally becomes
constant. This constant velocity is called
terminal velocity.
● Terminal velocity of a spherical body falling in
a viscous medium is proportional to the square
of radius of the body.
● When a liquid flow through a pipe, its speed is
maximum near axis and minimum near the
walls of the pipe.
● According to the equation of continuity the
speed of fluid flow becomes faster in the
narrow pipe.
● Stream Line Flow or Steady Flow In this
flow velocity at every point in the fluid will
remains constant.
● Turbulent Flow In this flow, the speed of
water is quite high, then the flow becomes
irregular.
● Critical Velocity The limiting velocity of a
liquid above which flow will become turbulent.
● Principle of Continuity For a tube of flow,
between two points having area of
cross-section A1
and A2
and velocities v1
and
v2
, between two points Av = Constant, ⇒
A v A v 1 1 2 = 2
Bernoulli’s Theorem
● When an incompressible and non-viscous
liquid (or gas) flows in streamlined motion
from one place to another, then at every point
of its path the total energy per unit volume
(pressure energy + kinetic energy + potential
energy) remains constant.
i.e. p gh v + + = ρ ρ
1
2
2
constant
where, p= pressure, ρ = density of fluid, v =
velocity of flow, h= height of the tube of flow
● Venturimeter, Pitot tube, Bunsen’s burner,
atomizer, filter pump and magnus effect are
based upon the Bernoulli’s theorem.
SIMPLE HARMONIC
MOTION
● If a body moves to and fro on a straight line
about a fixed position, then its motion is called
simple harmonic motion.
When a particle executing SHM passes through
the mean position, then
■ no force acts on the particle.
■ velocity is maximum.
■ acceleration is zero.
■ kinetic energy is maximum.
■ potential energy is zero.
When a particle executing SHM is
at the extreme end, then
■ velocity of particle is zero.
■ acceleration of the particle is
maximum.
■ kinetic energy of particle is zero.
■ potential energy is maximum.
■ restoring force acting on the
particle is maximum.
Note
● In case of spring block system the
restoring force F kx = −
where, x is displacement of the block
from mean position and k is spring
constant.
● In case of spring block system, time
period of oscillation is given by
T
m
k
= 2π , where m is mass of the
block.
Periodic Motion
● Any motion which repeats itself
after a regular interval of time is
called periodic or harmonic
motion and the period of repetition
is called time period.
● Motion of hands of a clock, motion
of Earth around the Sun, motion of
the needle of a sewing machine are
the examples of periodic motion.
Oscillatory Motion
● If a particle repeats its motion after
a regular time intervals about a
fixed point, motion is said to be
oscillatory or vibratory.
● Motion of piston in an automobile
engine, motion of balance wheel of
a watch are the examples of
oscillatory motion.
Simple Pendulum
● It is a heavy point mass suspended
from a rigid support by means of an
elastic inextensible string.

where, l is the length of simple
pendulum and gis the acceleration due
to gravity.
● The maximum time period of a simple
pendulum is 84.6 min.
● A pendulum clock goes slow in
summer and fast in winter.
● If a simple pendulum is suspended in
a lift descending down with
acceleration, then time period of
pendulum will increase. If lift is
ascending, then time period of pendulum
will decrease.
● If a lift falling freely under gravity, then the
time period of the pendulum will be
infinite. At Moon, the time period of simple
pendulum increases, because acceleration
due to gravity at Moon decreases.
Resonance
■
It is a phenomenon that occurs when a vibrating
system or external force drive another system to
oscillate with greater amplitude at a specific
preferential frequency.
Wave Motion
WAVES
● A wave is a disturbance which
propagates energy from one place to
the other without the transport of
matter.
● These are of two types
(i) Mechanical waves
(ii) Electromagnetic waves
Mechanical Waves
● The waves which require material
medium (solid, liquid or gas) for their
propagation are called mechanical
waves or elastic waves.
● These are of two types
1. Longitudinal waves
2. Transverse waves
Longitudinal Waves
● If the particles of the medium vibrate
in the direction of propagation of wave
motion, the wave is called longitudinal
wave. Waves on springs or sound
waves in air are examples of
longitudinal waves.
Transverse Waves
● If the particles of the medium vibrates
perpendicular to the direction of
propagation of wave, the wave is called
transverse wave. Waves on strings
under tension, waves on the surface of
water are examples of transverse waves.
Electromagnetic Waves
● The wave which do not require medium for
their propagation i.e. which can propagate
even though the vacuum are called
electromagnetic wave. They propagate as
transverse wave.
● The wavelength range of electromagnetic
wave is 10−4 m to 104m .
● Cathode rays, canal rays, α-rays, β-rays are
not electromagnetic waves. Light and heat
waves are examples of electromagnetic
waves.
Important Terms
Related to Waves
● Amplitude Maximum displacement of a
vibrating particle of medium from its mean
position is called amplitude.
● Phase The position of a point in time
(instant) on wave form cycle.
● Wavelength Wavelength is the distance
between any two nearest particle of the
medium, vibrating in the same phase.
● Frequency Frequency of vibration of a
particle is defined as the number of
vibrations completed by the particle in one
second.
Frequency ( ) f =

SOUND WAVE
● It is longitudinal mechanical waves.
● The longitudinal mechanical waves
which lie in the range 20 Hz to
20,000 Hz are called audible or sound
waves.
● These are sensitive to human ear.
● The longitudinal mechanical waves
having frequencies less than 20 Hz,
called infrasonic.
● These are produced by earthquakes,
volcanic eruption, ocean waves and
elephants and whales.
● The longitudinal mechanical waves
having frequencies greater than
20000 Hz are called ultrasonic waves.
● Human ear cannot detect the ultrasonic
waves. But certain creatures like dog,
cat, bat, mosquito can detect these
waves. Bat produce ultransonic waves.
● Ultrasonic waves are used for sending
signals, measuring the depth of sea,
cleaning clothes and machinery parts of
clocks, removing lamp shoot from
chimney of factories and in
ultrasonography.
Speed of Sound
● Speed of sound is maximum in solids
and minimum in gases.
● Speed of sound in air is 332 m/s, in
water is 1483 m/s and in iron is 5130
m/s. Speed of sound basically depends
upon elasticity and density of medium.
● When sound enters from one medium
to another medium, its speed and
wavelength changes but frequency
remains unchanged.
● Speed of sound remains unchanged by
the increase or decrease of pressure.
● The speed of sound increases with the
increase in temperature of the
medium. The speed of sound in air
increases by 0.61 m/s when the
temperature is increased by 1°C.
● The speed of sound is more in humid air
than in dry air because the density of
humid air is less than the density of
dry air.
● The speed of sound in air is very slower as
compared to the speed of light in air.
Therefore, in rainy season, the flash of
lightning is seen first and the sound of
thunder is heard a little later.
● The speed of sound in a medium is given
by v
E
=
ρ
, where, E is modulus of
elasticity of the medium, ρ = density
For gases, v
p
=
γ
ρ
Where, p is pressure and γ is ratio of
specific heats.
Characteristics
of Sound Waves
Intensity
● Intensity of sound at any point in space is
defined as amount of energy passing
normally per unit area held around that
point per unit time. SI unit of intensity is
W/m2
.
● Intensity of sound at a point is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
of point from the source and directly
proportional to square of amplitude of
vibration, square of frequency and density
of the medium.
● The loudness depends on intensity as well
as upon the sensitivity of the ear.
Pitch
● It is that characteristic of sound which
distinguishes a sharp sound from a grave
sound.
● Pitch depends upon frequency of sound
waves.
● The pitch of female voice is higher than
the pitch of male voice.
● The pitch of sound produced by roaring of
lion is lower, whereas the pitch of sound
produced by mosquito whisper is high.
Quality
It is that characteristic of sound which
enables us to distinguish between sounds
produced by two source having the same
intensity and pitch.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 363
Shock Waves
● A body moving with supersonic speed
in air leaves behind it a conical region
of disturbance which spreads
continuously. Such a disturbance is
called shock wave.
● These waves carry huge energy and
may even make cracks in window
panes or even damage a building.
● The speed of supersonic wave is
measured in mach number. One Mach
number is the ratio of speed of source
to the speed of sound.
Mach number =
Velocity of source
Velocity of sound
● If Mach number > 1, body is called
supersonic.
● If Mach number > 5, body is called
hypersonic.
● If Mach number < 1, body is said to be
moving with subsonic speed.
Reflection
of Sound Wave
● When sound waves incidence on any
rigid surface, it returns to its original
medium, this is called reflection of
sound wave.
Echo
● The repetition of sound due to
reflection of sound waves, is called an
echo. To hear echo, the minimum
distance between the observer and
reflector should be 17.2 m. Persistence of
ear is 1/10 s.
● At the Moon the echo is not heared due
to absence of atmosphere.
● A group of soldiers on a bridge are
advised not to walk in steps because
their movement causes the bridge to
vibrate. If they walk in step, the
frequency of vibration may match the
natural frequencey of the bridge
structure and thus causing resonance.
This resonance of frequencey can
cause the bridge to collapse.
● When a gun is fired at a visible
distance, the sound heard a little after
the smoke is seen because the velocity
of light is much higher than that of
sound.
Sonar
● It stands for sound navigation and
ranging. It is used to measure the depth of
a sea, to locate the enemy submarines and
shipwrecks .
● The transmitter of a sonar produces pulses
of ultrasonic sound waves of frequency of
about 50000 Hz.
● The reflected sound waves are received by
the receiver.
DOPPLER’S EFFECT
● If there is a relative motion between
source of sound and observer, the
apparent frequency of sound heard by the
observer is different from the actual
frequency of sound emitted by the source.
This phenomenon is called Doppler’s
effect.
● When the distance between the source
and observer decreases, the apparent
frequency increases and vice-versa.
Uses
(i) By police to check over speeding of
vehicles.
(ii)At airport to guide the aircraft.
(iii)To study heart beats and blood flow in
different parts of the body.
HEAT
● It is a form of energy which flows from
hotter to colder body by virtue of
temperature difference.
● It is due to the kinetic energy of the
molecules constituting the body.
● Its units are calorie (cal), kilocalorie (kcal)
or joule (J).
● 1 cal = 4.18 J, 1 kcal = 1000 cal
TEMPERATURE
● It is the measurement of hotness or
coldness of a body.
● An instrument used to measure the
temperature of a body is called a
thermometer.
● The normal temperature of a human body
is 37° C or 98.4°F.
● − ° 40 is the temperature at which Celsius
and Fahrenheit thermometers read same.
364 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
● The clinical thermometer reads from
96°F to 110°F.
● Triple point is the state at which all the
three states of matter coexist. The
triple point of water is 273.16 K.

● The temperature at which Celsius and
Reaumur scale read the same is zero.
● Freezing point of mercury is − ° 39 C.
Hence, to measure temperature below
this temperature, alcohol thermometer
is used. Freezing point of alcohol is
115°C.
Pyrometer
● Pyrometer measures the temperature
of a body by measuring the radiation
emitted by the body.
● It cannot measure temperature below
800°C because at low temperature
emission of radiation is very small and
cannot be detected.
SPECIFIC HEAT
● It is the amount of heat required to
raise the temperature of a unit mass of
the substance by 1°C. Its unit is J/kg-°C.
● It is given by S
Q
m
=
∆θ
, where m is the
mass Q is amount of heat given to the
substance and ∆θ is change in
temperature.
● Specific heat of water is 4200 Jkg− − °
1 1 C
or 1
1 1 calg− − oC which is high in
comparison to most other substances.
Therefore, water is used as coolant in
radiator of vehicle.
● For most substances, the specific heat
increases with rise in temperature and
assumes a constant value at high
temperature.
● The specific heat of water, however
decreases with rise in temperature from
0°C to about 4°C after which it
increases with temperature.
● Mercury has low specific heat.
● Latent Heat of Vaporisation It is the
amount of heat required to change the
phase of the substance at constant
temperature.
● Hot water burns are less severe than that
of steam burns because steam has high
latent heat.
● Latent heat of fusion of ice is 80 cal/g.
● Latent heat of vaporisation of steam is 536
cal/g.
● Its SI unit is J/kg. Ice at 0°C appears
colder than that water at 0°C, because ice
takes more heat.
● Molar Heat Capacity at Constant
Pressure (CP
) It is the amount of
heat required to raise the temperature of 1
mole of gas by 1 K at constant pressure.
● Molar Heat Capacity at Constant
Volume (CV
) It is the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature of
1 mole of gas by 1 K at constant volume.

Thermodynamics
● Zeroth law of Thermodynamics If two
bodies A and B are separately in thermal
equilibrium with the third body C, then A
and B will be in thermal equilibrium with
each other.
● First Law of Thermodynamics The
amount of heat given to a system is used
up in two ways, first to increase the
internal energy and second to do the
external work.
● i.e. dQ dU = (internal energy) + dW
(work done).
● Second Law of Thermodynamics The
second law of thermodynamics is the
outcome of human experience under
which heat energy can be converted into
mechanical energy.
● Kelvin-Planck’s Statement It is
impossible to construct a device which
operates in a cycle that will take heat from
a body and convert it completely into the
work without producing any other effect.
● Clausius Statement It is impossible to
construct a self acting device which
operates in a cycle that will transfer heat
from a cold body to a hot body without
expenditure of work.
● Change in entropy at temperature T.
When ∆Q amount of heat exchanged is
∆

Thermal Expansion
● It is the increase in size of the body on
heating.
● A solid can undergo three types of thermal
expansions
1. Linear expansion (expansion in
length).
2. Superficial expansion (expansion in
area).
3. Cubical expansion (expansion in
volume).
Note Almost every liquid expands with the
increase in temperature. But when
temperature of water is increased from 0°C
to 4°C, its volume decreases, after this its
volume increases.
Relation between the coefficients of linear,
superficial and cubical expansions:
α β γ : : : : = 1 2 3
Practical Applications
of Thermal Expansions
■ Telephone wires are given enough gap to
allow the wires for contraction in winter.
■ An ordinary pendulum clock runs faster in
winter but slower in summer, because in
summer the length of pendulum increases,
while in winter it decreases.
■
In the construction of bridges, ends of
steel girders are not fixed but placed on rolls to
allow free expansion and contraction in summer
and winter respectively to avoid any damage to
the bridge.
■ A gap is provided between the iron rails of the
railway track so that rails can easily expand
during summer and do not bend.
Humidity
● The amount of water vapour in air is called
as humidity.
● The amount of water vapour present in 1 m
3
air is called its absolute humidity.
● The ratio of amount of water vapour ( ) m
actually present in a certain volume of air
at a given temperature to the amount of
water vapour ( ) M required to saturate it, is
called Relative Humidity ( ) RH .
● Relative humidity is measured by
hygrometer.
● Relative humidity increases with the
increase of temperature.
Transmission of Heat
Transfer of heat from one place to other
place is called transmission of heat.
There are three processes, by which
transmission of heat takes place.
● Conduction
● Convection
● Radiation
Conduction
● In this process heat is transferred
without actual movement of the
particles of medium.
● In this process path of heat transfer is
irregular. In solid, transmission of
heat takes place by conduction
process.
● Mercury though a liquid is heated by
conduction and not by convection.
Convection
● In this process, heat is transferred by
the actual movement of particles of
the medium due to difference in
densities of different parts of the
medium.
● In liquid and gases transmission of
heat takes place by convection
process. This process is also slow.
● The chimney used in kitchen or in a
factory is based on the convection.
In rooms ventilators are provided to
escape the hot air by the process of
convection.
Radiation
It is the quickest way of transmission of
heat in which there is no need of
medium for transfer of heat. Heat from
the Sun reaches the Earth by radiation.
In this process, heat is transferred at the
speed of light.
Kirchhoff’s Law
● Kirchhoff’s law signifies that good
absorbers are good emitter.
● If a shining metal ball with some black
spot on its surface is heated to a high
temperature, the shining ball becomes
dull but the black spots shines brilliantly
because black spot absorbs radiation
during heating and emit in dark.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 365
366 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Perfectly Black Body
● A perfectly black body is one which
absorbs completely all the radiations
falling on its surface, whatever be the
wavelength.
Note Since perfectly black body is a perfect
absorber, hence according to Kirchhoff’s
law, it will also be a perfect radiator.
Stefan’s Law
● The radiant energy emitted by unit area
of perfectly black body per unit time is
directly proportional to the fourth power
of its absolute temperature.
E T ∝
4 ⇒ E T = σ 4
where, σis Stefan’s constant and its value
is 5.67 ×
− − − 10 8 2 4 Wm K
Newton’s Law of Cooling
● The rate of loss of heat by a body is
directly proportional to the difference in
temperature between the body and its
surrounding.
● Cooking utensils are made of
aluminium, brass and steel because
these substances have low specific heat
and high conductivity.
● In deserts day temperature are very high
and night temperature are extremely low
because the specific heat of sand is very
low. Therefore it absorbs the heat readily
and its temperature raises by a large
degree during the day. At night sand
radiates the heat equally readily making
the temperature loss.
● Human breath is visible in winter but not
in summer because in winter air is cold
and so water vapours present in the
human breath condense, making it
visible.
● A thick glass tumbler often cracks when
very hot liquid is poured into it because
the inner surface of the thick glass
tumbler coming in contact with the hot
liquid expands more in comparison with
the outer surface which has relatively
lower temperature. This unequal
expansion of inner and outer surfaces
causes the tumbler to crack.
● Water from a hand pump is warm in
winter and cold in summer because in
winter outside temperature is low and in
summer outside temperature is higher
as compared to the temperature of water
obtained from underground which
remains practically unchanged due to
Earth being bad conductor of heat.
LIGHT
● It is the radiation which makes our eyes
able to see the object. Its speed is
3 108
× m s/ .
● It is the form of energy. It is a transverse
wave.
● It takes 8 min 19 s to reach on the Earth
from the Sun.
● The light reflected from Moon takes
1.28 s to reach Earth.
● It represents the phenomenon of
reflection, refraction, interference,
differaction, scattering and polarisation.
Reflection of Light
● The return of light into the same
medium after striking a surface is called
reflection.
Laws of Reflection
There are two laws of reflection
(i) The angle of incidence is always
equal to angle of reflection.
(ii) The incident ray, normal and
reflected ray all lie in the same
plane at point of incidence.
Reflection from
Plane Mirror
● Size of image is always equal to size of
object.
● The image in a plane mirror appears as
far behind the mirror as the object is
infront of it.
● If the object is displaced by a distance a
towards or away from the mirror, then its
image will be displaced by a distance a
towards or away from the mirror.
● The minimum size of the mirror
required to see the full image of an
observer is half the height of the
observer.
● If the plane mirror is rotated in the
plane of incidence by an angle θ, then
the reflected ray rotates by an angle 2θ.
● Focal length of plane mirror is infinity. i.e.
power of the plane mirror is zero.
● Linear magnification produced by plane
mirror is 1.
● When two plane mirrors are kept facing
each other at an angle θ and an object is
placed between them, then

Reflection at Spherical
Surface
● Spherical mirrors are the mirrors in
which reflecting surface side is spherical.
There are two types of spherical mirrors
(i) Convex mirror
(ii) Concave mirror

Uses of Mirrors
1. Plane mirrors are used as looking
glass.
2. Concave mirror is used as shaving
mirrors, used by doctors, shades of
table lamp, for search lights.
3. Convex mirror is used as back view
mirrors in vehicles, in street lamps etc.
Refraction of Light
● When a ray of light passes from
one medium to other, it bends from
its path. This phenomenon of
bending of light ray is called as
refraction of light.
● When a ray of light travels from one
medium to another the wavelength and
velocity of light changes, but the
frequency does not change.
Laws of Refraction
There are two laws of refraction
(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray
and the normal at the point of
incidence all lie on the same plane.
(ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of
incidence to the sine of the angle of
refraction is a constant for a given

368 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
● Twinkling of stars is based upon
refraction.
● Due to refraction, rivers appear shallow,
coin in a beaker filled with water appears
raised, pencil in the beaker appear
broken.
● At sunset and sunrise, due to refraction,
Sun appears above horizon, while it is
actually below horizon.
● The duration of day appears to be
increased by nearly 4 min due to
atmospheric refraction.
● Writing on a paper appears lifted when a
glass slab is placed over the paper.
● The refractive index of a medium is
maximum for violet colour of light and
minimum for red colour of light.
● Refractive index decreases with rise in the
temperature.
Total Internal Reflection
of Light
● When a light ray goes to rarer medium
from denser medium, then as we increase
the angle of incidence, angle of refraction
also increases. The angle of incidence for
which the angle of refraction becomes 90°
is called critical angle.
● If the angle of incidence in denser
medium is greater than critical angle (C),
then the ray is reflected back into the
denser medium, this phenomenon is
called total internal reflection. It is
necessary for the total internal reflection
of light to occur that the light ray should
go to rarer medium from denser medium.
● Angle of incidence in denser medium
should be greater than critical angle.
● In desert, the phenomena of mirage
occurs due to total internal reflection.
● The air bubbles in glass paper weight
appear silvery white due to total internal
reflection. Sparkling of diamond is due to
multiple total internal reflection taking
place inside the diamond.
Scattering of Light
● When light ray passes through a medium
in which particles are suspended, whose
sizes are of the order of wavelength of
light, then light on striking these
particles, deviated in different directions.
This phenomenon is called scattering
of light.
● Red colour of light is scattered least and
violet colour of light is scattered most.
Therefore, danger signals are of red
colour.
● Blue colour of sky is due to scattering of
light. The brillant red colour of rising
and setting Sun is due to scattering of
light.
● Clouds appear white due to scattering
of light.
Optical Fibre
It is a device based on total internal
reflection by which a light signal can be
transferred from one place to the other
with a negligible loss of energy.
It is used in testing the internal organs of
human body i.e. endoscopy.
Lenses
● Lens is a transparent medium bounded
by two curved surfaces. Lenses are of
two types
(i) Concave or divergent lens.
(ii) Convex or convergent lens.

If the lens is immersed in a medium having
refractive index more than that of lens, then the
nature of the lens changes i.e. convex lens
behaves as convave lens and vice-versa.

If the lens is immersed in a medium having
refractive index equal to that of the lens, the
lens behaves as a plane glass plate.

Power of Lens
● It is the reciprocal of focal length of lens. It
is measured in metre.
P
f m
=

( )
● Its unit is dioptre ( ) D .
Prism
● It is a uniform transparent refracting
medium bounded by two plane surfaces
inclined at certain angle.
Dispersion of Light
● When a narrow beam of light is
incident on a prism, the emergent
beam is not only deviated, but at the
same time splits up into a coloured
band of seven colours. This
phenomenon is called dispersion of
light.
● The seven colours of band are violet,
indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and
red.
● Violet colour deviates through maximum
angle and red colour deviates through
the minimum angle.
● Red, green and blue are called primary
colours or basic colours.
Mixing of Colours
● Red + Green + Blue = White
● Red + Blue = Magenta
● Blue + Green = Peacock blue
(or Cyan)
● Red + Green = Yellow
● If all the colours of white light are
reflected back from the object, then it
appears white.
● And if all the colours of white light is
absorbed by an object, then it appears
black.
● Polarisation is the only phenomenon
which proves that light is a transverse
wave.
● The layer of kerosene oil over water
surface appear coloured in the
presence of sunlight due to proper
interference of light.
HUMAN EYE
● It is an optical instrument just like a
photographic camera. It forms the real
image of the object on retina of the
eye.
● For the normal eye, the range of vision
is from 25 cm to infinity.
Defects of Vision Myopia
● In this case, the person cannot see the
distant object clearly.
● Image is formed before the retina.
Concave lens is used for correcting
myopia.
370 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Hypermetropia
● In this case, the person cannot see near
object clearly.
● Image is formed behind the retina.
● Convex lens is used for correcting
hypermetropia.
Astigmatism
● In this case, the curvature of cornea becomes
irregular and image is not clear. Cylindrical
lens is used for correcting astigmatism.
Presbyopia
● In old age the power of accommodation of
the eye lens decrease, therefore, neither near
nor distant objects are clearly seen.
Presbyopia can be removed by using bifocal
lenses.
Cataract
● In this defect, an opaque, white membrane is
developed on cornea due to which a person
loses power of vision partially or completely.
● This defect can be removed by removing this
membrane through surgery.

small objects.

● It consists of two convex lenses.
● In a compound microscope the focal
length of the objective lens is short

Electricity
Electric Charge
● It is something that a body attains when it
loses or gains the electrons.
● The positive and negative labels and sign for
electric charges were chosen arbitrarily by
Benjamin Franklin.
● Similar charges repel each other while
opposite charges attract each other.
● Charge is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is
coulomb C.
● Electricity is associated with the charge.
● The proton possesses positive charge (+e)
and electron possesses an equal negative
charge (−e),
where, e C = ± × −
1.6 10 19
● Conductors are those substances
which allow passage of electrical
charge to flow through them and
have very low electrical resistance.
● Metals like silver, iron, copper are
conductors.
● Human body and Earth act like a
conductor. Silver is the best
conductor.
● Insulators are those substance
which do not allow passage of charge
through themselves. Rubber, wood,
mica, glass, ebonite are insulators.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 371
Coulomb’s Law
The force of attraction or the force of
repulsion acting between the two point
charges is proportional to the product of the
magnitudes of the two charges and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them.

Electric Field
● The region around an electric charge
in which the electric effect can be
experienced is called the electric field.
Electric Field Intensity (E)
The electric field intensity at any point is
the force experienced by a unit positive
charge placed at that point.
i.e. Electric field intensity (E) =
F
q0
where, q0
is positive test charge
● Electric field intensity inside a charged
hollow conductor is zero.
● Electric Field Lines of Force Electric
field at a place is pictorially represented
by these lines. These originate at
positive charge and terminate at
negative charge.
Electric Potential
● Electric potential at any point of the
electric field can be measured by the
amount of work done in bringing a unit
positive charge from infinity to that
point.
● Its unit is volt and it is a scalar quantity.
● The electric potential inside a
spherical surface is same at each point
and is equal to the potential on the
surface.
● Electrical potential on Earth is
considered to be zero.
● Work done in bringing a unit positive
charge from one point to other point is
the potential difference between the
two points.
● The work done in moving charge on
equipotential surface is zero, because
potential remains same throughout the
surface.
ELECTRICAL CAPACITY
● When a conductor is given a charge, its
potential rises in proportion to the charge
given, the constant of proportionality is
called capacitance (C) i.e. C

■ A lightning conductor is fixed to tall building to
protect them from the distructive effect of the
lightning.
■ The filament of an electric bulb is made of
tungston because it has a high melting point and
can be heated to a high temperature to emit light.
■ An electric bulb makes a bang when it is broken
because there is a vacuum inside the electric
bulb, when the bulb is broken air rushes in at
great speed from all sides to fill the vacuum. The
rushing of air produces a noise generally referred
to as the bang.

close together, they exert force on each
other.
● Similar poles repel each other and
dissimilar poles attract each other.
● The area surrounding the magnet in
which, another magnet experience a force
on it is called magnetic field. The unit of
magnetic field is newton/ampere- metre or
weber/ metre2
or tesla.
● Magnetic lines of force are imaginary
lines in the magnetic field, which shows
the direction of magnetic field
continuously.
● The magnetic lines of force outside the
magnet always travel from North pole to
South pole and inside the magnet from
South pole to North pole.

100 nanometre in at least one dimension,
and involves developing materials or
devices within that size.
● The term nanotechnology was defined by
Tokyo University of Science Professor

follows: “Nanotechnology mainly consists
of the processing, separation,
consolidation, and deformation of
materials by one atom or by one
molecule.”

describes engineered nanosystems
(nanoscale machines) operating on the
molecular scale. Molecular
nanotechnology is especially associated

that can produce a desired structure or
device atom-by-atom using the principles
of mechnosynthesis.
■ Air bubble rises up in water because of
upthrust and its potential energy decreases.
■ When two protons are brought towards
each other they repel each other being similar
charges, thus work is done by us in bringing
them close. So, potential energy increases.
■ When the energy of the satellite is
negative, it moves in either a circular or an
elliptical orbit. When the energy of satellite
is zero, it escapes away from its orbit and its
path becomes parabolic.
■ When the energy of a satellite is positive,
it escapes from the orbit following a
hyperbolic path. When the height of the
satellite is increased, its potential energy
increases and kinetic energy decreases.

● They are very dense as compared to liquid
and gas. e.g., wood, stone, iron, etc.
Melting Point
● It is a temperature at which a substance
converts from its solid state to liquid
state. Melting point of ice is 0° C.
● Melting point decreases in the presence
of impurity.
Sublimation
● It is the process of conversion of a
substance from the solid state to the gas
state without passing through an
intermediate liquid phase.
● It is used to separate a sublimate
(substance undergoing sublimation like
camphor, naphthalene, ammonium
chloride, etc) from non-sublimate.
Liquids
● They have definite volume but no definite
shape. They take the shape of the vessel
in which they are kept.
● They can flow, hence, considered as
fluids e.g., milk, water, mercury, etc.
Boiling Point
● It is a temperature at which vapour
pressure of a liquid becomes equal to
atmospheric pressure and at which a
substance converts from its liquid state
to gaseous state.
● It is different at different places.
● Boiling point of water at normal
conditions is 100° C.
● It usually decreases at high altitudes,
that’s why, at high altitudes, the boiling
point of water is less than 100°C and
more time is required to cook a food.
● Boiling point of water in pressure cooker
is high due to high pressure and hence,
less time is required to cook the food.
● Boiling point increases in the presence
of impurity.
Evaporation
● It is the process of conversion of a liquid
into vapours at any temperature below
its boiling point. It increases with
increase in surface area and
temperature.
● It produces cooling. That’s why we feel
cool when some nail polish remover or
spirit is kept on our palm.
Gases
● They have neither definite volume nor
definite shape. They take the shape and
volume of the container in which they
are filled.
● They are highly compressible.
● They can flow so considered as fluids,
e.g., air, oxygen and nitrogen.
Condensation
● It is the process of conversion of gas into
liquid or liquid into solid
● Solids, liquids and gases are inter
convertible by changing the conditions
of temperature and pressure.

less than proton, the atom carries positive
charge and if electrons are more than
proton, the atom carries negative charge.
Discovery of Nucleus
● The model known as Rutherford’s
Model, was based upon α-particle
scattering experiment and suggests that
most of the part of an atom is empty.
● It also suggests that the entire mass of
an atom is concentrated on its centre at
the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded
by electrons that move around the
nucleus with a very high speed in
circular paths called orbits.
● It contains protons and neutrons which
are collectively called nucleons.

Niels Bohr Model
This model suggests that the electrons are
confined into clearly defined, quantised
orbits and could jump between these, but
could not freely spiral inward or outward in
intermediate states.
Planck’s Quantum Theory
According to this theory

absorb energy only in the form of
discrete packets of energy called quanta.

fermions (particles with half-integer
spin) may occupy the same quantum
state simultaneously.
or
● Only two electrons may exist in the same
orbital but these electrons must have
opposite spin.
RADIOACTIVITY
● It was discovered by Henry Becquerel but
term radioactivity was given by Madam
Curie. It is the process of spontaneous
disintegration of nucleus and is
measured by Geiger counter.
● It is a nuclear phenomenon, thus
remains unaffected by external factors
like temperature, pressure, etc.
Radioactive Rays
Radioactivity involves emission of α β, and
γ rays or particles and has units Curie,
Becquerel, Rutherford.
Alpha ( ) α Rays
● These rays consist of positively charged
helium nuclei (He ) ++ . They have +2unit
charge and 4 u mass.
● They have low penetrating power but
very high ionising power and kinetic
energy.
● An α-emission reduces the atomic mass
by 4 and atomic number by 2, thus, the
new nuclei formed occupy a position two
places left to the parent nuclei in the
periodic table (Soddy Fajans group
displacement law).
Beta ( ) β Rays
● These rays consist of negatively charged
electrons ( ) − 1
0
e and have − 1 unit charge
and zero mass.
● These are more dangerous than α-rays.
● These have high penetrating power as
compared to α-rays.
● A β-emission increased the atomic
number by one with no change in atomic
mass, thus, the new nuclei obtained
occupy a position one place right to the
parent nuclei in the periodic table
(Soddy Fajans group displacement law).
Gamma ( ) γ Rays
● These are electromagnetic radiation and
have very high penetrating power.
● These have low ionising power and
kinetic energy.
● Their emission does not affect the
position of nuclei in the periodic table.
Half-Life Period
It is the time in which a radioactive
substance remains half of its original
amount.
Nuclear Fission
● It is a process in which a heavy nucleus
is broken down into two or more lighter
fragments.

Sun is also a result of a series of nuclear
fusion reactions.
Hydrogen Bomb
It contains a mixture of deuterium oxide
(D O) 2
and tritium oxide (T O) 2
in a space
surrounding an ordinary atom bomb.

CHEMICAL BONDING
● It is formed by elements to complete
eight electrons in their outer shell i.e., to
complete their octet.
● It results in decrease in energy and
increase in stability.
Ions
These are of two types : cation and anion.
Cations are formed by the loss of electrons
and carry positive charge, e.g., Na +
, Mg2+
.
Anions are formed by the gain of electrons,
and carry negative charge e.g.,Cl –
, F
–
, etc.
Electrovalent Bond
or Ionic Bond
● It is a type of chemical bond formed
through an electrostatic attraction
between two oppositely charged ions.
● It is formed between a cation, which is
usually a metal, and an anion, which is
usually a non-metal, e.g.,

Ionic Compounds
● They can conduct electricity in molten
state or in solution, but not in solid state.
● They have a high melting point and tend
to be soluble in water. Examples of such
compounds are limestone (CaCO )3
,
common salt (NaCl), lime (CaO),
magnesium oxide (MgO), etc.
● The energy required to separate the ions
of an ionic compound is called lattice
energy.
Covalent Bond
● It is a type of chemical bond that is
characterised by the sharing of electrons
between two atoms.
● It may be a single bond (), formed by
sharing of two electrons i.e., one electron
from each atom, double bond
(==), formed by sharing of four electrons
i.e., two electrons from each atom, or
triple bond (≡≡), formed by sharing of six
electrons i.e., three electrons from each
atom.
● The geometry of few covalent molecule
H2O (water) – Bent, NH3
(ammonia) –
pyramidal, CH4
(methane)–tetrahedral,
CO2
(carbon dioxide) –linear.
● Single bond contains only 1 σ-bond;
double bond contains 1 σ and 1π-bond;
and triple bond contains 1σ and
2π-bonds.

Covalent Compounds
1. They are non-conductor of
electricity.
2. They have low thermal
conductivity.
3. They are insoluble in water, but
soluble in non-polar solvents like
benzene, acetone, ether, etc.
4. They have low melting and boiling
points (diamond and graphite
have very high melting point.)
5. They are directional. So, have
definite geometry.
Coordinate or Dative Bond
● It is a special type of covalent bond
in which both the electrons for
sharing (i.e., shared pair of
electrons) are given by only one
atom.
● Coordinate compounds have
properties in between the ionic and
covalent compounds.
● Examples of coordinate compounds
are
Hydrogen Bond
● It is the attractive interaction of a
hydrogen attached to highly
electronegative atom (such as N, F,
O) with another electronegative
atom, such as nitrogen, oxygen or
fluorine.
● It is stronger (has energy 5 to
30 kJ/mol) than a van der Waals’
interaction.
● It occurs in both inorganic
molecules such as water and
organic molecules such as DNA.
● Ethanol, amine (except 3° amine),
etc., can form H-bond with water,
so these are soluble in water
although these are covalent
compounds.
van der Waals’ Interaction/Force
The attractive forces among the non-polar
molecules in solid or liquid states. These are
relatively weaker compared to normal chemical
bonds.
The ability of Geckos which can hang on a
glass surface using only one toe-to climb on sheer
surfaces has been attributed to the van der Waals’
forces between these surfaces and spatulae or
microscopic projections, which cover the hair-like
setae found on their footpads.
CHEMICAL REACTION
The process in which substances (reactants)
react to form new compounds (products), is
known as chemical reaction.
Types of Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions are of following types

Reactions occurring between the ions
or ionic compounds are very fast.
Exothermic Reactions
These are those reactions in which
energy is released, e.g., burning of
natural gas, respiration, decomposition
of vegetable matter into compost,
combustion reactions etc.
Endothermic Reactions
These are those reactions in which
energy is consumed, e.g., digestion,
photosynthesis, evoporation of water,
melting of an ice, etc.
Redox Reactions
In such reactions, oxidation and
reduction occurs, simultaneously.
These are called disproportionation
reaction when the same element is
oxidised as well as reduced.
Oxidation
● It involves addition of oxygen or any
other electronegative element like
fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), nitrogen
(N), etc.
● It involves removal of hydrogen ( )H
or any other electropositive element
like sodium (Na). It involves loss of
electrons i.e., increase in the
positive charge of ion.
Reduction
● It involves addition of hydrogen or
any other electropositive element.
● It involves removal of oxygen or any
other electronegative element. It
involves gain of electron, i.e.,
decrease in oxidation state.
Oxidising Agent or Oxidant
These are the substances that have the ability to
oxidise other substances, e.g., H O2 2, MnO4
−

or elec- tronegative
elements (O , F , Cl , Br ) 2 2 2 2 etc.
Reducing Agent or Reductant

reduce other substances, transfer electrons to
another substance; e.g., electropositive element,
metals such as lithium, sodium, magnesium,
iron, zinc, and aluminium, hydride transfer
reagents, such as NaBH4
and LiAlH4

● It was discovered by Berzelius.
● It is a term, used for the reactions/ processes
which occur in the presence of certain
substances that increase the rate of the
reaction without being consumed. Such
substances are called catalysts.

Periodic Properties
and their Trends
Periodic properties are those which
shows a regular trend along a period
and a group.
Atomic Size
● It generally increases on moving
down the group because number of
shells increases.
● It decreases along a period from left
to right. Thus, size of alkali metal is
largest and that of halogens is
smallest in a period.
● Smallest atom is hydrogen and
largest atom is cesium.
● Most poisonous metal is plutonium.
Valency
● It is the combining capacity of an
element.
● It increases from 1 to 7 along a period
with respect to oxygen whereas with
respect to hydrogen, it first increases
from 1 to 4 and then decreases to 0.
● For alkali metal (i.e., sodium,
potassium, etc.,) it is 1, for alkaline
Earth metals (i.e., magnesium,
calcium, etc.,) is 2, for aluminium, it
is 3 and for nitrogen it is 3. It remains
the same in a group.
● For s-block elements, all the elements
in a group have same valency.
● For p-block elements, they show variable
valencies [P(3, 5), S(4, 6) but tendency to
show higher valency decreases when we
move down in a group due to inert pair
effect.
● For d-block elements Fe(2, 3), Cu (1, 2) the
elements of same group may have different
valencies, and the element itself exhibit
different valencies.
Oxidation State
● It is the hypothetical charge that an atom
would have if all bonds of atoms of different
elements were removed.
● It is typically represented by integers, which
can be positive, negative or zero.
● It is + 1 for hydrogen, − 2 for oxygen (except
in peroxide i.e., − 1 and in F O2
i.e., + 2), + 1
for sodium and potassium and + 2 for
magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium
(Sr).
● It is − 1for fluorine (always).
● It is zero for a neutral molecule.
Example : Calculation of oxidation number of
Mn in KMnO4
.
Let the oxidation number of Mn is X.
KMnO4 = 1 + 4 X + ( ) − = 2 0
Therefore, the oxidation number of Mn in
ΚM On 4
is + 7.
Metallic Character
● It is the tendency of an element to form
cation by the loss of electrons.
● It decreases along a period from left to right
and increases in a group on moving
downwards.
Ionisation Energy
● It is the energy required to remove an
electron from the outermost shell of an
isolated gaseous atom.
● It generally increases along a period
from left to right but ionisation energy of Be,
Mg, Ca, Sr is larger than the ionisation
energy of B, Al, In, Tl, respectively.
Moreover, ionisation energy of N, P is larger
than ionisation energy of O, S respectively.
● It generally decreases in a group on moving
downwards.
Electron Affinity (EA)
● It is defined as the energy liberated when an
extra electron is added to an atom.
394 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Newly Discovered Element
Ununseptium, recently discovered, a
superheavy chemical element with atomic
number 117, is a member of group-17 in the
periodic table below the five halogens
(fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and
astatine). Its synthesis was claimed in
Dubna, Russia by a joint Russian-American
collaboration. In 2014, the GSI Helmholtz
Centre for Heavy lon Research in Germany
also claimed to have successfully repeated
original experiment. Ununseptium is a
temporary systematic name that is
intended to be used before a permanent
one is established. It is commonly called
element-117, instead of ununseptium.
● It increases across a period from left to
right but EA of II(2), 15 group and 0
group is 0 or positive.
● It decreases on moving down a group.
● It is highest for chlorine.
Electronegativity
It is the tendency of an atom in a molecule
to attract the shared electrons towards itself.
It increases regularly along a period from left
to right and decreases on moving down a
group. It is highest for fluorine.
Metals and their Properties
● These are the elements which are hard,
lustrous, ductile, malleable, sonorous
and conductor of heat and electricity in
their solid as well as molten state.
● These form oxide with air. These oxides
are generally basic, but oxides of zinc
and aluminium are amphoteric, i.e.,
have acidic as well as basic properties.
● These evolve hydrogen gas when reacts
with water and acids.
● Metals which are highly reactive
displace the less reactive metals from
their salts. The order of reactivity is :
potassium (K) > calcium (Ca) >
sodium (Na) > magnesium (Mg) >
aluminium (Al) > zinc (Zn) > iron (Fe)
> lead (Pb) > hydrogen (H) > copper
(Cu) > mercury (Hg) > silver (Ag) >
gold (Au) (Thus, gold is less reactive
metal).
e.g., When iron nails are kept in copper
sulphate solution (blue), iron being more
reactive displaces the copper from copper
sulphate solution and thus, the blue
colour of solution disappears.
● Mercury (metal) is liquid at room
temperature.
● Metal with lowest density is lithium.
● Tungsten is the metal having highest
melting point.
● Reactivity of metals increases while that
of non-metals decreases on moving
down the group.
● Sodium and potassium are soft and
highly reactive metals. These react with
air and water. That’s why these are kept
in kerosene oil. Silver, gold and
platinum do not react with air even on
strong heating.
● Sodium and potassium burn in water
while calcium floats over it.
● Copper (Cu) is the first metal used by
man.
● Pb (lead) is a bad conductor of electricity.
● Ti (Titanium) is called strategic metal.
Non-Metals and their Properties
● These may be solid, liquid or gas
(bromine is the only liquid non-metal).
● These are soft, non-lustrous, brittle,
non-sonorous and non-conductor of heat
and electricity.
● These have low melting and boiling
points.
● These form oxides with oxygen which are
generally acidic.
● Examples are noble gases [i.e., helium
(He), neon-(Ne), argon (Ar), krypton
(Kr), xenon (Xe) and some other p-block
elements].
● Diamond is the hardest substance known.
Iodine is lustrous. Melting point is very
high for diamond and graphite.
● The order of hardness of some
substances is : diamond > corundum >
topaz > quartz.
Helium
● It is a noble gas (discovered by Lockyear
and Janssen).
● It is used for filling balloons and other
lighter aircrafts. Helium, when mixed
with Oxygen, is used by deep-sea divers
for breathing and for respiratory patients.
● It is used as a heat transfer agent in gas
cooled nuclear reactors.
Neon
It was discovered by Ramsay and Travers. It is
used in neon signs.
Argon
It was discovered by Rayleigh and Ramsay. It
is used to generate inert atmosphere for
welding and to fill incandescent light bulbs.
A mixture of mercury vapours and argon gas
is filled in tube lights.
Xenon
It is called stranger gas. Xe, when mixed
with Kr, used in high intensity, short
exposure photographic flash tubes.

● It is an amorphous or transparent
solid, also called supercooled liquid.
● It contains mainly silica (SiO ) 2
.
It can be of the following types
1. Soda or Soft Glass is sodium
calcium silicate (Na O CaO 2
⋅ ⋅6SiO )2
It is the ordinary glass and used for
making bottles, window panes, etc.
2. Potash Glass or Hard Glass
contains potassium (from K CO ) 2 3 .

Cement or Portland
Cement
● It is a complex material containing the
silicates and aluminates of calcium
with small amount of gypsum.
● It has the following composition
Calcium oxide (CaO) 50 60% = −
Silica (SiO ) 20 25% 2 = −
Alumina (Al O ) 5 10% 2 3 = −
Magnesium oxide (MgO) 2 3% = −
● It is manufactured from limestone and
clay. If cement contains excess lime,
cracks during settings can occur and if
lime is less, cement is of weak strength.
● Gypsum decreases the rate of setting of
cement.
● A paste of sand, cement and water is
called mortar and is used for joining
bricks and plastering walls.
● A mixture of stone chips (gravel), sand,
cement and water is known as concrete
and is used for flooring and making
roads.
● Concrete with steel bars and wires is
called Reinforced Concrete ( C) R and
used for constructing roofs, bridges and
pillars.
Medicines
These are the chemicals used for the
treatment of diseases and reduce
suffering from pain. These are classified
as
● Analgesics are used to reduce pain.
e.g., aspirin, paracetamol, morphine,
etc.
● Antipyretics is used to reduce body
temperature during high fever, e.g.,
paracetamol, aspirin, phenacetin,
analgin and novalgin.
● Tranquilisers are used to treat stress,
mild and severe mental disease. These
are also called psychotherapeutic
drugs. e.g., equanil, valium, veronal,
serotonin, chlorodiazepoxide,
meprobamate, etc.
● Antiseptics prevent the growth of
microorganisms or kill them but are not
harmful to living tissues. e.g., dettol,
savlon, iodine tincture, boric acid,
hydrogen peroxide, etc.
● Dettol is a mixture of chloroxylenol and
α-terpineol. Chloroxylenol is responsible
for its antiseptic property.
● Antibiotics are obtained from
microorganisms and used to destroy the
other microorganisms e.g., penicillin,
(discovered by A. fleming in 1929)
ampicillin, amoxycillin (all are narrow
spectrum), ofloxacin, tetracycline,
chloramphenicol (all are broad
spectrum).
● Antimalarial are used to treat malaria.
e.g., chloroquine.
● Sulpha drugs are alternatives of
antibiotics, e.g., sulphanilamide,
sulphadiazine, etc.
● Antacids are used as a remedy for acidity.
e.g., magnesium hydroxide, sodium
bicarbonate (baking soda), etc.
● Pesticides are used to destroy the
organisms that harm the crop.
These are of the following types
1. Insecticides e.g., DDT, aluminium
phosphate, gammexane.
2. Fungicide e.g., bordeaux mixture.
3. Herbicides e.g., benzipram,
benzadox.
4. Rodenticides e.g., aluminium
phosphide.
Polymers
They are made up of many repeating units
known as monomers. Some important
polymers such as plastics, fibres and rubber
are discussed below.
Plastics
● These are cross-linked polymers (a
substance having high molecular weight
and repeating unit) and are very tough.
● Lac is a natural plastic (polymer).
These are of two types
1. Thermoplastics are the polymers which
can be easily softens on heating and hard
on cooling e.g., polythene, polystyrene,
polyvinyl chloride, teflon etc.
2. Thermosetting plastics are the
polymers which undergo permament
change on heating due to excessive
cross-linking. These cannot be reused,
e.g., bakelite.

Natural Rubber
It is an elastomer. It is a polymer of isoprene
(2-methyl-1, 3 butadiene). It is also called
cis-polyisoprene. Synthetic rubber
(neoprene) is a polymer of chloroprene.
● It is insoluble in water, dilute acids and
alkalies, absorbs a large amount of water
and has low tensile strength and
elasticity.
● It is heated with sulphur compounds at
373K in the presence of ZnO to improve
the properties. This process is called
vulcanisation of rubber.
● If it is vulcanised with 5% S, it is used for
making tyres and if with 30% sulphur, it is
used in making battery cases.
● Trans-polyisoprene is called
gutta-purcha.
● Thiokol rubber is a polymer of ethylene
chloride and sodium polysulphide and is
used in the manufacture of hoses, tank
lining, engine gaskets and rocket fuel.
Explosives
Some examples of explosives are
trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitroglycerine or
trinitroglycerine (TNG), cyclotrimethylene
trinitroamine (RDX, also called cyclonite).
AIR, WATER
Air or Atmosphere
● Air is a homogeneous mixture of
different gases.
● It has the following composition : 78%
nitrogen; 21% oxygen, 0.03-0.05%
carbon dioxide (CO ), 2
argon, etc.
● An atmosphere is a layer of these gases
surrounding a planet or other material
body of sufficient mass that is held in
place by the gravity of the body.
Constituent of Atmosphere
It has different density at different heights
from sea level. Thus, several layers are
formed. These layers are
Troposphere
● It is the lowest layer of atmosphere,
extend upto a height of 18 km from sea
level.
● It is a turbulent and dusty zone which
contains air (N , O , CO ) 2 2 2 much water
vapours and clouds.
Stratosphere
● It lies between 18-60 km above sea level.
● It is the layer which contains ozone
layer (protects us from harmful UV rays
coming from the Sun), so called
ozonosphere.
Mesosphere
● It extends from 60-85 km above sea
level.
● Its temperature decreases with height
and reaches to − ° 100 C. That’s why
when any meteors enter in mesosphere,
it burns up.
Thermosphere
● It extends up to 10-50 km above sea
level.
● In this region, the temperature can rise
to 1500°C, a person would not feel warm
because of the extreme low pressure.
● The international space station orbit is
also in thermosphere.
408 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Exosphere
● It lies between 500-1600 km above sea
level.
● This region contains ionised gases.
● Beyond this region, interstellar space is
present.
Major Gases in Air
Oxygen( ) O2
● It was discovered by K Scheele.
● It is obtained during photosynthesis.
● It is colourless, odourless, neutral gas
which gets adsorbed over alkaline
pyrogallol.
● It is non-combustible, but helps in
combustion. It form oxides with metals
and non-metals.
● It is used for artificial respiration and in
oxy-hydrogen flame and, oxygen-ethylene
flame and oxygen-acetylene flame (used
for welding) and as a rocket fuel.
● Metal oxides are generally basic but
alumina (Al O ), 2 3 zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin
oxide (SnO )2
are amphoteric oxides.
● Carbon dioxide (CO2
) is acidic while
carbon monoxide (CO) is neutral.
Ozone (O )3
● It is an allotrope of oxygen.
● It is used as an insecticide, in purification
of water, to preserve food, to synthesise
artificial silk and camphor, act as a
bleaching agent.
Nitrogen (N2
)
● It was discovered by Rutherford (in 1771).
● It is a colourless, odourless,
non-combustible, non-poisonous gas.
● It is neutral and lighter than air
containing N2
.
● It is filled in sealed packets and bulbs to
create inert atmosphere.
● Living beings die in an environment of
nitrogen.
● Soil contains several pores filled with air
containing N2
. At the time of raining these
pores get filled with water. That’s why
earthworm come at the surface to breath.
Carbon Dioxide (CO )2
● It is used by plants for photosynthesis.
● It is 1.5 times heavier than water.
● It turns the lime water milky which
disappears in the excess of CO2 due to
conversion of milky calcium carbonate
(CaCO ) 3
into soluble calcium
bicarbonate.
● It is used to extinguish fire and for
artificial respiration when mixed with
oxygen (carbogen).
● It is dangerous to have charcoal fire
burning in a closed room because it
produces carbon monoxide gas, which
is suffocating.
● Plants respire at night and releases
CO2 which reduces oxygen content of
air required for breathing, so it is
dangerous to sleep under trees at night.
● Eno (fruit salt) produces effervescence
if dissolved in water due to evolution of
CO2
gas.
Water( ) H O2
● It contains two elements : hydrogen and
oxygen (H O) 2
. It constitute about 70%
part of Earth.
● It is a universal solvent and maintains
the body temperature due to its high
specific heat.
● It has boiling point 100 C° and freezing
point 0 C. ° Its density is maximum at
4°C.
Types of Water
There are different types of water
Soft water Soft water easily form lather
with soap due to absence of soluble salts,
calcium and magnesium.
Hard water It does not form lather with
soap due to presence of Calcium and
magnesium salts.
It is of two types
Temporary Hard Water
● It contains bicarbonates of calcium and
magnesium.
● It is converted into soft water by boiling
or by adding calculated quantity of
calcium hydroxide (Clark’s process).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 409
Permanent Hard Water
● It contains sulphates and chlorides of
calcium and magnesium.
● It is converted into soft water by
adding sodium carbonate (Na CO ), 2 3 or
calgon or zeolite.
Heavy Water
It is deuterium oxide,D O2
(molecular mass
20). It is used as a moderator in nuclear
reactors, in the study of mechanisms of
chemical reactions involving hydrogen and
its compounds, etc.
POLLUTION
Pollution is the contamination of
material particles or energy into the
natural environment. It causes adverse
effects on the ecosystem.
Types of Pollution
Air Pollution
● It occurs when any harmful gases,
dust, smoke enters into the
atmosphere and make it difficult for
plants, animals and humans to
survive.
● Common respiratory diseases such as
asthma, bronchitis can occur.
Water Pollution
● It is due to the presence of foreign
substances like sewage, algae, soluble
salts, etc., in water.
● It can also be due to presence of
metals in water. This pollution causes
following diseases.
Metal Disease
Chromium and
Arsenic
Cancer
Cadmium Itai-itai disease
Mercury Minamata disease
● For a healthy aquatic life, dissolved
oxygen (DO) is 5-6 ppm.
● For clean water, BOD (biochemical
oxygen demand) is less than 5 ppm
while for highly polluted water, it is 17
ppm or more.
Soil Pollution
It is alteration in soil. It is caused by
pesticides, insecticides (e.g., DDT, BHC etc)
herbicides (e.g., sodium chlorate), fungicides
(e.g., organomercury compounds).
Hazardous Effect of Pollution
Greenhouse Effect
It is the heating of Earth and its objects
because of the trapping of IR radiations by
carbon dioxide ( ), CO2 methane ( ) CH4
, nitric
oxide (NO), ozone (O3
), chlorofluoro carbons
(CFCs) and water vapours.
Global Warming
● It is a result of increased concentration of
greenhouse gases.
● It may result in melting of ice caps and
glaciers, spreading of several infectious
diseases like malaria, sleeping sickness,
etc.
Acid Rain (By Robert Augus)
● It has pH less than 5. It is due to the
presence of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur
in air that dissolve in rain water and forms
nitric acid and sulphuric acid.
● It damages the buildings and other
structures made up of limestone and
results in several diseases such as skin
infections.
● pH of normal rain water is 5.6.
Pollutants
These are the substances that contaminate the
environment and of two types
Primary Pollutants
These persist in the environment in the form
in which they are produced e.g., sulphur
dioxide (SO ), 2 nitrogen dioxide (NO2
), etc.
Secondary Pollutants
● These are the products of reaction of
primary pollutants e.g., PAN
(Perocyacylnitrates), ozone ( ), O3
aldehyde,
etc.
● The order of different pollutants to cause
pollution is carbon monoxide (CO), SO2 >
hydrocarbon > particulates > nitrogen
oxides.
410 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
● It is formed by incomplete combustion.
● It is a colourless, odourless gas.
● It contain a triple bond and are fairly
polar, resulting in a tendency to bind
permanently to haemoglobin molecules,
displacing oxygen, which has a lower
binding affinity.
Particulates
These are minute solid particles and liquid
droplets dispersed in air. e.g., mists, dusts,
smoke, fumes, etc.
Disease Cause
Pneumoconiosis Due to inhalation of coal
dust.
Silicosis Due to inhalation of free
silica (SiO ). 2
Black lung disease Found in workers of coal
mines.
White lung disease Found in textile workers.
Byssinosis Due to inhalation of
cotton fibre dust.
Smog
It is a consequence of particulate pollution
and is of two types
Classical Smog
● It is also called London type smog.
● It is reducing in nature.
● It is formed in cool humid climate when
carbon soot particles combine with
gaseous oxides of sulphur.
Photochemical Smog
● It is also called Los Angeles smog.
● It occurs in warm, dry and sunny climate
by the action of sunlight on unsaturated
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide.
● It is oxidising in nature.
Tropospheric Pollution
Presence of undesirable solid or gaseous
particles in the air. Gaseous air pollutants
are S, N and C, H S, 2 hydrocarbons, ozone
and other oxidants. Particulate pollutants
are dust, mist, fumes, smoke, smog, etc.
Stratospheric Pollution
● Stratospheric pollution means depletion
of ozone layer (ozone hole) by certain
compounds like chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), oxides of nitrogen (which are
released into upper atmosphere from
engines of supersonic transport planes).
● CCl 4
, halons and methyl chloroform also
deplete ozone layer.
● Depletion of ozone layer can cause skin
cancer, sunburn, ageing of skin, cataract
or even blindness and also increases the
evaporation of surface water.

it does not get oxygen which helps in
burning.
Phosphorus catches fire if kept in air but
it is unreactive with water, so it is kept in
water.
When sugar is heated above 200°C, it
decomposes into carbon and water.
Therefore, gets charred.
While making ice cream, salt is mixed

(2014), for the smart work of surpassing
the limitations of the light microscope,
which has brought optical microscopy into
the nano dimension. By this achievement,
scientists can visualise the roadways of
individual molecules in the living cells.
Now this can be seen that how molecules
produce synapses between nerve cells in
the brain. Also they can find proteins
involved in different diseases like
Parkinson, Alzheimer and Huntington as
well as in fertilised eggs.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2015) was
awarded jointly to Tomas Lindahl, Paul
Modrich and Aziz Sancar. “for mechanistic
studies of DNA repair”.

INTRODUCTION
● Biology is a natural science
concerned with the study of life and
living organisms, i.e., plants and
animals. It is classified into two part:
Botany and zoology.
● Study of plants is called Botany and
study of animals is called Zoology.
Zoology and Botany are collectively
called Biology. The term ‘Biology’
was coined by Lamarck and
Treviranus.
● The scientist who gave his thought
for the first time about the life of
plants and animals was Aristotle.
That’s why he is known as the Father
of Biology. He is also known as the
Father of Zoology.
● Theophrastus is known as Father of
Botany.
CHARACTERISTIC OF
LIVING ORGANISMS
● They have cellular organisation and also
respire, i.e., take in O2
and evolve CO2
.
● Metabolism is one of the most important
characteristic feature of living organism. It
comprises two phases that are anabolism
(constructive phase) and catabolism
(destructive phase.)
● They take nutrition for their growth.
● They have tendency to reproduce.
● They have the ability to respond to changes
in both internal and external environment
i.e., they have sensitivity. Their survival
chances are maximum.
● They move from place to place as animals or
some bacteria. Plants cannot move but
some movement can occur in plants.
The Cell
● The Cell is the basic structural and
functional unit of all known living
organisms. It is the smallest unit of
life and is often called the building
block of life.
● The branch of biology which deals
with the study of cell, is called
Cytology.
● Robert Hooke coined the term cell
when he saw honey-comb like
structure in the section of cork.
However, he only discovered cell wall.
● The first living cell was discovered by
Leeuwenhoek.
Types of Cells
These are of two types
1. Prokaryotic Cells
(Pro=primitive, karyos=nucleus)
These are primitive cells, lacking a
well defined nucleus and most of
the other cell organelles, e.g.,
bacterial cell.
2. Eukaryotic Cells (Eu = true, karyos =
nucleus) These have a well defined
nucleus and membrane bound cell
organelles. These are present in
unicellular and multicellular plant and
animal cells.
Prokaryotic Cell Eukaryotic Cell
Simplest and
primitive in nature.
Developed and
comparatively complex in
nature.

envelope
Nucleus is present with
elaborate nuclear envelope
Membrane bound
cell organelles are
absent.
Membrane bound cell
organelles are present.
Single naked
chromosome
present.
Many chromosomes are
present.
Cell division is
direct.
Cell division occurs by
mitosis or meiosis.

Facts about Cell
■ The largest known cells are unfertilised Ostrich
egg cells (size 6 inch diameter).
■ The smallest cell is of PPLO (Mycoplasma
gallisepticum of size 0.1-0.3µm).
■ Human nerve cell is the longest animal cell.
■ Largest unicellular plant is Acetabularia (10 cm)
and animal is Amoeba (1 mm).
■ The largest human cell is the female ovum and
the smallest human cell is the red blood cell.
Parts of Cell and their
Functions
A typical cell consists of cell wall and
protoplasm.
Protoplasm of Cell
It is the living fluid matter present inside the
plasma membrane. The fluid present outside
the nuclear membrane is called cytoplasm and
the fluid present inside the nuclear membrane
is called nucleoplasm. Deutoplasm is the
non-living matter of the cell.
Cell Wall
It is present in plant cells, bacteria, fungi, algae
and some archaea. It is composed of cellulose
in plants and chitin in fungi. It is non-living. Its
main function is to provide shape and rigidity to
the cell.
Plasma Membrane
The cell is enclosed by a thin membrane called
the cell membrane or plasmalemma. It is
composed of proteins and phospholipid
molecules. It is elastic, living and selectively
permeable, i.e., provide passage for various
substances.
Mitochondria
● It was discovered by R Altman in
1880 and the term mitochondria
was coined by Carl Benda.
● It is bounded by a double membrane. The inner membrane has
many folds, called the cristae. Fluid
(called matrix) is present on interior,
which contains many enzymes and
coenzymes. It is a semi- autonomous
(can form its own copies) organelle
and is called power house of the
cell because in it, stepwise oxidation
of fuel occurs which results in
release of chemical energy. This
energy is stored in the form of ATP.
Plastids
● These are present only in plant cells
and are of three types– chloroplasts
(green), leucoplasts (white) and
chromoplasts (of various colours
except green). Chloroplast is the site
of photosynthesis as it contains
chlorophyll, while leucoplasts are
storage plastids. Chloroplast is called
the kitchen of the cell.
● The red colour of tomatoes is due to
the presence of lycopene pigment,
i.e., chromophore.
● The colour of carrot is due to
carotene pigment.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It was discovered by KR Porter. These
are hollow membranous system having
ribosomes (thus called Rough ER) or
no ribosomes (thus called Smooth
ER).
Rough endoplasmic reticulum is
the site of protein synthesis, while
smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the
site of synthesis of steroids and
detoxification.
Golgi Apparatus
It was discovered by Camillo Golgi. It
is made up of sac-like flattened
structures and play an important role
in secretion, transportation and
acrosome formation.

Nobel Prize in Physiology and
Medicine 2013
The Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine 2013 was
awarded jointly to James E Rothman, Randy W
Schekman and Thomas C Sudhof for their
discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic, a
major transport system in our cells. In general, we
call it Golgi body. Randy Schekman discovered a set
of genes that were required for vesicle traffic.
James Rothman discovered machinery that allows
vesicle to fuse with their targets to deliver the
stored matter..
Ribosomes
Ribosomes were discovered by GE Palade.
These are minute, non-membranous particles,
composed of RNA and protein. 70 S type of
ribosomes are found in prokaryotes, while 80 S
type in eukaryotes. These are the site of protein
synthesis.
Lysosomes
● Lysosomes were discovered by de Duve.
These are polymorphic organelles having
hydrolytic enzymes. These enzymes function
at (acidic) pH ~ 5. These are sometimes
called suicidal bags of the cell.
● Lysosome helps in carcinogenesis, i.e.,
conversion of a normal cell into cancerous
cell.
Centrosome
It was discovered by T Boveri. It is composed of
two set of centrioles and participate in the
formation of mitotic spindle during cell division.
Vacuoles
These are non-living reservior, bounded by
a membrane called tonoplast. Pigment
anthocyanin is present in the cell vacuole,
which provide colour to flowers. It stores toxic
metabolic waste and helps in osmoregulation.
Nucleus
It was discovered by Robert Brown. It contains
nucleoplasm, nucleolus and chromatin
material. Nucleolus is rich in protein and RNA.
All this material is covered up by a nuclear
membrane. Chromatin is the controlling
centre of cell as it form chromosomes.
Chromosome
Chromosome is thread-like structure,
found in the nucleus. Bead-like
structures found on chromosome are
called genes, which are made up of
DNA and are the carrier of genetic
information from generation to
generation. Chromosomes are units of
inheritance. In some viruses e.g.
retrovirus, RNA is the genetic
material.
Plant Cell Animal Cell
It has cell wall. Cell wall is usually
absent.
Plastids are found. Plastids are usually
absent.
Centrioles and
centrosome are
absent.
Centrioles and
centrosomes are
found in all cells.
A big vacuole is
present.
Vacuole is absent
or very small in
size.
Nucleic Acids
These contain the genetic
instructions used in the development
and functioning of all known living
organisms.
These are of two types : DNA and RNA.
Deoxyribonucleic
Acid (DNA)
● DNA was discovered by James
D Watson and Francis Crick, who
got Nobel Prize for this discovery.
● It is a long polymer made from
repeating units called nucleotides.
● Each nucleotide consists of a
nucleoside (i.e. nitrogenous base
and deoxyribose sugar) and a
phosphate group, joined together by
phosphodiester bonds.
● It has four bases, i.e. adenine,
guanine, cytosine and thymine.
● Adenine and guanine are the
purine bases; cytosine and thymine
are pyrimidine bases.
416 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)
● It is also made up of a long chain of
nucleotides.
● Each nucleotide consists of a
nitrogenous base, a ribose sugar, and
a phosphate group.
● It contains uracil in place of thymine.
● RNA is of three types—
mRNA (messenger RNA)
rRNA (ribosomal RNA)
tRNA (transfer RNA)
These three RNA’s take part in protein
synthesis.
Cell Division
● It is the process by which a cell
increase in number. It is essential for
the growth, development and repair
of the body.
● It is of two types – Mitosis and Meiosis
(i) Mitosis It occurs in unicellular
organism during asexual reproduction.
Each mitotic cell division results in the
formation of two daughter cells having
number of chromosomes equal to the
parent cell.
Tumour or cancer is a result of
uncontrolled mitosis.
(ii) Meiosis It occurs in reproductive cells
and is called reduction division because of
the presence of single set of chromosomes
(i.e., half of the parent chromosomes). It
results in the formation of four daughter
cells.
● Exchange of genetic material occurs
between chromatids (branches of
chromosome) of a diploid set during
pachytene stage of meiosis and is known as
crossing over.
BIOMOLECULES
Biomolecules are the substances that
are essential for a living being to
perform the basic functions,
e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids
(fats), nucleic acids and vitamins.
Carbohydrates
● It was believed that these are the
organic compounds which have carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of
1 : 2 : 1 but starch (C H O 6 10 5)n
and
some others are exceptions. So this
definition has been changed. According to
modern definition, these are the
polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones or their
derivatives.
● These are the source of energy and about
50-75% energy is obtained by the oxidation
of carbohydrates.
● The main end product of carbohydrate
digestion is glucose, which is called blood
sugar. It oxidises to give energy along with
CO2
and H O2
.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 417
DNA RNA
It usually occurs inside nucleus and in some
cell organelles like mitochondria and
chloroplast.
Very little RNA occurs inside nucleus. Most of it
is found in the cytoplasm.
DNA is the genetic material except in some
viruses.
RNA is not the genetic material except in
certain viruses, e g. ., HIV, reovirus.
It is double stranded with the exception of
some viruses like φ × 174.
RNA is single stranded with the exception of
some viruses, e g. ., double stranded in T2
, T4
,
T6 bacteriophage.
DNA shows regular helical coiling. There is no regular coiling except in parts of
RNA.
It contains deoxyribose sugar. It contains ribose sugar.
Nitrogen base thymine occurs in DNA along
with other three i.e. adenine, cytosine and
guanine.
Thymine is replaced by uracil in RNA. The
other three are adenine, cytosine and guanine.
It replicates to form new DNA molecules. It cannot replicate itself except in RNA-RNA
viruses.
DNA controls heredity, evolution, metabolism,
structure and differentiation.
RNA controls only protein synthesis.
● 1 gm glucose provides about 17 kJ energy
or 4.2 kcal energy.
● Carbohydrates are better fuel as
compared to proteins and fats as they
readily decompose to give energy.
● Main sources of carbohydrates are wheat,
maize, rice, potato etc.
The carbohydrates are categorised into
following three types
Monosaccharides
● These are simple sugars, which cannot be
hydrolysed further, e.g., ribose, glucose,
fructose, galactose etc.
● In human beings, blood glucose level is
100-120 mg/mL. Extra glucose, if any, is
converted into glycogen in the liver by a
process called glycogenesis.
● D-fructose is the sweetest of all sugars
and is found in fruit juice, honey etc.
Oligosaccharides
● They release 2-10 monosaccharides on
hydrolysis, like disaccharides, e.g.
sucrose, lactose maltose etc and
trisaccharides, like raffinose etc.
● Sucrose is also called invert sugar. It
gives glucose and fructose when
subjected to hydrolysis.
Polysaccharides
● They release more than ten
monosaccharides on hydrolysis. These
are non-sugars, i.e., do not have sweet
taste, e.g., cellulose, glycogen and starch.
● Cellulose is found in plant cell wall and is
digested by ruminants (like cow, goat,
buffalo, etc), but not by carnivorous or
omnivorous animals like human beings.
Thus, it acts as roughage in case of
human beings.
Function of Carbohydrates
● Carbohydrates provide energy, that acts
as reserve food, help in the synthesis of
nucleic acid and form exoskeleton of
animals. Excessive intake of carbohydrate
results in digestive problems and obesity.
Proteins
These are found in all living cells. These are
the compounds of carbon (C), hydrogen
(H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and sulphur
(S). These form 15% part of human body.
Snake venom, ricin of castor and bacterial
toxins are proteinaceous in nature. Main
sources of protein are groundnuts,
soyabean, pulses, fish etc.
Function of Proteins
● These are important for the growth and
repair of the body (75% of our body is
protein only). However, in the
deficiency of carbohydrates, these acts
as the source of energy. Protein also
control the development of genetic
characters.
● Deficiency of protein causes
Kwashiorkor (a disease in which hands
and legs of children get slimmed and the
stomach comes out) and Marasmus (a
disease in which muscles of children are
loosened). Kwashiorkor occurs in
children between 1 to 5 years of age and
marasmus in children below 1 year.
Lipids (Fats)
● These are also the compounds of carbon
(C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O).
Chemically, these are the ester of
glycerol and fatty acids. These are
present in cytoplasm, cell wall etc.
● The main source of fats are ghee, butter,
almond, cheese, egg yolk, meat,
soyabean etc.
● Fats are digested by enzymes called
lipases in the small intestine. Generally,
at 20°C, these are in solid state but if
their state is liquid at this temperature,
these are termed as oils.
● Fatty acids are of two types- Saturated
and Unsaturated. Saturated fatty acids
are found in coconut oil and palm oil,
while unsaturated fatty acids are found
in fish oil and vegetable oil.
● Excess of saturated fats raises the level
of blood cholesterol and may cause
arteriosclerosis. This may lead to
heart attack.
Function of Lipids
The main functions of lipids are
● These provide twice the energy than
that from carbohydrates.
● These remain under the skin and
prevents the loss of heat from the body.
418 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Malnutrition Effects
● Deficiency of fat results in dryskin and weight
loss.
● If fat is in excess, the body gets fatty and
result in several heart diseases and high
blood pressure.
● The skin fat, in case of whales and seals,
forms a thick layer called the blubber. It acts
as reserve food and also maintains the body
temperature.
Vitamin
● It was first discovered by FG Hopkin.
However, the term vitamin was coined by C
Funk.
● Vitamin is an organic compound, which
cannot be synthesised in sufficient quantities
by an organism and must be obtained from
the diet.
● They provide no calories, they only regulate
chemical reactions occurring in the
metabolism of the body.
These are divided into two groups
1. Fat soluble vitamin, viz. vitaminA, D, E and K.
2. Water soluble vitamin, viz.
vitamin-B and C.
● Vitamin-B12 contains cobalt.
Vitamin-D is synthesised in our skin
by the action of ultraviolet rays of
the sunlight. Vitamin-K is
synthesised in our colon by the
bacteria.
● Water soluble vitamins normally do
not show hypervitaminosis (this
disease occurs due to excess intake
of vitamins) as excess of these
vitamins is normally excreted
through urine.
● In balanced diet, all the important
nutrients (like carbohydrate,
protein, fats, vitamins etc.) are
available in sufficient quantity.

Biological Evolution
Origin of Universe
● The universe is made up of matter and
energy. Scientists believe that it was
formed about 10 to 13 billion years ago
as a vast, dense, red-hot and rotating
gaseous cloud of cosmic dust called the
“primaeval matter or ‘ylem’.
● Two hypothesis i.e., Big -Bang
(universe formation through a very big
explosion) and Nebular (universe
formation by the condensation of
gaseous cloud) were given to explain
origin of Earth.
ORIGIN OF LIFE
● Life originated on Earth about 3.5
billion years ago. Some philosophical
theories like special creation,
spontaneous generation, Biogenesis,
panspermia (life originated in the form
of pansperms from some unknown
part of the universe) or cosmozoic and
catastrophism (life orginated suddenly
from inorganic matter) were given to
explain origin of life.
● The first scientific account of the
origin of life was given by Russian
scientist AI Oparin in his book ‘Origin
of life’.
● The primitive atmosphere contained
hydrogen, methane, ammonia and
water vapour. In it, oxygen and ozone
were absent. Thus, it was believed that
life is originated from inorganic
substances by a series of complex
reaction.
● Hydrogen atoms were most numerous
and most reactive in the primitive
atmosphere. First, these combined
with all available oxygen atoms,
forming water and leaving no free
oxygen atoms. Thus, the primitive
atmosphere was ‘reducing’ unlike the
present ‘oxidising’ atmosphere. This
was also supported by Miller and Urey
in 1953.
● In Miller-Urey experiment, a mixture
of water, hydrogen, methane and
ammonia was cycled through an
apparatus and the organic compound,
amino acids were obtained.
Organic Evolution
More and more creation of organism by
gradual changes from low category animal to
higher animal is called organic evolution.
There are several evidences regarding
organic evolution.
Evidences from morphology
and anatomy
On the basis of morphology (outer
appearance) and anatomy (inner structure),
several evidences have been described as
follows
Homologous Organs
● The organs which are similar in basic
structure and origin but dissimilar in
function are called homologous organs,
e.g., wings of bat, cat’s paw, front foot of
horse, human’s hand and wings of birds.
● These show divergent evolution.
Analogous Organs
(Homoplastic)
● The organs which are similar in shape and
function but dissimilar in their origin and
development. e.g., wings of insects, birds
and bats, eyes of octopus and mammals.
● They show convergent evolution.
Vestigial Organs
● These are degenerate, non-functional
organs which were functional earlier.
● Human body has been described to possess
about 90 vestigial organs. Some of these
are muscles of ear pinna, canine teeth and
third molar teeth, body hairs, vermiform
appendix, nictitating membrane of eye,
caudal vertebral (coccyx or tail bone) etc.
Atavism or Reversion
It is the sudden reappearance of some
ancestral features. Appearance of thick body
hair, large canines, monstral face, short
temporary tails, extra nipples etc are
examples of atavism.
Evidence from Connecting
Links
Connecting link is one which exhibit
characteristics of more than one groups.

THEORIES OF
EVOLUTION
Lamarckism (1809)
● Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck gave the idea that
an organism can pass on characteristics that it
acquired during its lifetime to its offspring
(also known as heritability of acquired
characteristics).
● Lamarck’s theory of evolution was published
in Philosophie Zoologique and had four
propositions, viz
1. Living organisms and its parts tend to
increase in size due to internal force of life.
2. Formation of new organs is the result of a
new need and new involvement.
3. Individuals lose characteristics that they do
not require (or use) and develop
characteristics that are useful.
4. Individuals inherit the traits of their
ancestors.
Darwinism (1859)
● Darwin’s theory of evolution was Origin of
Species by Natural Selection.
● The theory consists of five propositions, they
are
1. Overproduction or enormous fertility
2. Struggle for existence
3. Variation and heredity
4. Survival of the fittest or natural selection
5. Origin of species.
Mutation Theory
● Hugo de Vries proposed the theory
of mutation, while working on
Oenothera lamarckiana plant.
● Mutations are discontinuous
variations.
● Mutations are due to changes in
chromosomes, genes and DNA.
● These may or may not be inherited.
Synthetic Theory
According to it, the five basic factors
are
1. Gene mutation
2. Changes in chromosome
structure and number
3. Genetic recombination
4. Natural selection
5. Reproductive isolation
First three factors are responsible for
genetic variablity.
■ Devonian period is known as Age of
fishes.
■ Mesozoic era is known as Age of
Reptiles.
■ Coenozoic era is known as Age of
Mammals.
Classification of
Organisms
In Linnaeus time, a two kingdom
system of classification with Plantae
and Animalia kingdom was developed.
The system did not distinguish
between the eukaryotes and
prokaryotes, unicellular and
multicellular and photosynthetic
organisms.
Five Kingdom System
RH Whittaker (1969) proposed a five
kingdom classification. The kingdom
named were Monera, Protista, Fungi,
Plantae and Animalia.
Classification of
Animalia Kingdom
Storer and Usinger classified
animals into following phylums
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 421
Phylum–Protozoa
● These are unicellular animals, i.e., made
up of only one cell.
● In these, all the metabolic activity like
digestion, respiration, excretion and
reproduction takes place in unicellular
body.
● Respiration and excretion take place
through diffusion.
e.g., Amoeba, Plasmodium, Euglena etc.
Phylum–Porifera
● These are found in marine water and have
porous body. The pores are called ostia.
These are multicellular animals.
● Their skeleton is made up of minute
calcareous or siliceous spicules.
e.g., Sycon, Sponge etc.
Phylum–Coelenterata
● These are aquatic animals, have thread-like
structures called tentacles around the
mouth which help in holding the food.
● They have specialised cnidoblast cell to
help in catching the food.
● Phenomenon of polymorphism (many
forms) and metagenesis (alternation of
generation) are associated with
coelentrates.
e.g., Hydra, Jelly fish, Sea Anemone etc.
● Hydra has a tendency of regeneration of
body organs.
Phylum– Platyhelminthes
● Animals of this phylum have
alimentary canal with single opening,
anus is absent.
● Excretion takes place by flame cells.
● There is no skeletal system such as,
respiratory system, circulatory system
etc.
● These are hermaphrodite animals
(males are not separated from
females).
e.g., Planaria, Liver fluke, Tape worm
etc.
Phylum–Aschelminthes
● These are long, cylindrical,
unsegmented worms.
● Their alimentary canal is complete in
which mouth and anus both are
present.
● There is no circulatory and respiratory
system but nervous system is
developed. Excretion takes place
through protonephridia.
● They are unisexual.
● Most forms are parasitic but some are
free living in soil and water.
e.g., Ascaris, Threadworm, etc.
¡ Threadworm is found mainly in the
anus of child. Due to which children
feel itching and often vomits. Some
children urinate on the bed at night.

¡ Eyes of octopus are similar to chordate
eyes.
Phylum– Echinodermata
● All the animals in this group are marine.
They have water vascular system.
Brain is not developed in nervous
system.
● They have a special capacity of
regeneration.
● These are the only invertebrate animals
which contain proper bone like
structures (ossicles).
e.g., Star fish, Sea urchin, Sea cucumber
etc.
Phylum-Chordata
● They have notochord. A dorsal hollow
tubular nerve cord and paired
pharyngeal gill slits at some stage of their
life span.
● In advanced forms, notochord changes
to vertebral column, nerve cord develops
to brain and spinal cord and pharyngeal
gill slits to structures of jaw attachment.
● This phylum is sub-divided into two
sub-phylum, i.e., Protochordata and
Vertebrata.
Some main classes of phylum– Chordata
are as follows
Pisces
● These are aquatic animals (cold-blooded
animals). Their heart pumps only
impure blood and have two chambers.
● Respiration takes place through gills.
e.g., Trygon, Scoliodon, Torpedo etc.
Amphibia (First land
vertebrates)

● Respiration takes place through lungs.
● They have 3
1
2
chambered heart (four
chambered in crocodile).
● Their eggs are covered with shell made up
of calcium carbonate.
e.g., Lizard, Snake, Tortoise, Crocodile,
Turtle, Sphenodon etc.
¡ Cobra is the only snake which makes
nests.
¡ Heloderma is the only poisonous lizard.
¡ Sea snake is also called Hydrophis
belcheri. It is the world’s most poisonous
snake.
Aves (Aerial Vertebrates
Birds)
● The animals of this group are
warm-blooded tetrapod vertebrates with
flight adaptation.
● Their fore-feet are modified into wings to
fly.
● They respire through lungs.
● Birds have no teeth, beak helps in feeding.
● They have a single ovary and pneumatic
bones. e.g., Crow, Peacock, Parrot etc.
¡ Flightless birds are Kiwi and Emu.
¡ Largest bird is Ostrich.
¡ Smallest bird is Humming bird.
¡ Largest zoo in India is Alipur (Kolkata)
and the largest zoo of the world is Cruiser
National Park in South Africa.
Mammalia
● These are warm-blooded animals.
● Tooth comes twice in these animals
(diphyodont).
● There is no nucleus in their red blood cells
(except in camel and llama).
● Skin of mammals contains hair.
● External ear is present.
Mammalia is divided into three
sub-classes
● Prototheria It lays eggs, e.g.,
Echidna.
● Metatheria It bears the immature
child, e.g., Kangaroo.
● Eutheria It bears the well developed
child, e.g., Humans.
They give birth to young ones, but
Echidna and Platypus are the egg
laying mammals.
SYSTEMS OF
HUMAN BODY
Integumentary System
The human skin (integumentary) is
composed of a minimum of three major
layers of tissue, the epidermis, dermis
and hypodermis.
Epidermis
The top layer of skin is made up of
epithelial cells and does not contain
blood vessels.
Dermis
● It gives elasticity to the integument,
allowing stretching and conferring
flexibility, while also resisting
distortions, wrinkling and sagging.
● Nails grow 1 mm per week on an
average.
● Protein, keratin stiffens epidermal
tissue to form finger nails.
Hypodermis
● It is made up of adipose tissue.
It performs several important functions
1. Protect against invasion by
infectious organisms.
2. Protect the body from dehydration.
3. Maintain homeostasis.
4. Act as a receptor for touch, pressure,
pain, heat and cold.
5. Protect the body against sunburns by
secreting melanin.
6. Generate vitamin-D through
exposure to ultraviolet light.
7. Store water, fat, glucose and
vitamin-D.
424 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Animal Nutrition and
Digestion
Animals are not able to synthesise their
own food, therefore they obtain it from
outside environment for their nutritional
requirements.
Mineral Nutrients
● These are metals, non-metals and their
salts other than the four
elements—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
and oxygen and constitute about 4% of
total body weight.
● Milk, eggs, meat, fruit, food, vegetables
etc are the sources of minerals.
Minerals are of two types
1. Macronutrients These are required in
large amount, e.g., calcium (Ca),
phosphorus (P), potassium (K) etc.
2. Micronutrients These are required in
very small amount (less than 1 g), e.g.,
iodine (I), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) etc.

Water
About 70% of the human body consists of
water. Two-third of water exists inside
cells, the other one-third is outside the
cells in tissue fluid and blood plasma. It is
essential for digestion, transportation,
excretion and to regulate body
temperature.
Many factors affects the health of human
body. One of them is adulteration.
Food Adulteration
Addition of undesirable, cheap and
harmful substances in the food is called
food adulteration.
Indian Standards Institution (ISI) Mark
and Agmark (Agricultural marketing) are
given by the Bureau of Indian Standards
after testing the purity and quality of

HUMAN DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM
The human digestive system consists of
alimentary canal and digestive glands.
The alimentary canal consists of mouth,
(having teeth and tongue) oesophagus,
stomach, small intestine and large
intestine.
Teeth
● With the help of teeth the food is
chewed. Teeth are of four types
Incisors (for cutting)
Canines (for tearing)
Premolars (for chewing)
Molars (for chewing and grinding)
● The number of teeth are different in
different animals. These are represented
by dental formula as
I C Pm M – Upper half jaw
I C Pm M – Lower half jaw
Where, I − Incisors, C − Canines,
Pm − Premolars and M − Molars.
● Premolars and molars are called cheek
teeth. Milk teeth do not include molar
teeth.
● In humans, first teeth come in between
6 and 8 months. By the age of 6, milk
teeth are gradually replaced by permanent
teeth.
● Hardest part in the body is tooth enamel.
● In elephants, the tusks are the incisors of
upper jaw.
● Maximum number of teeth are present in
horse and pig.

Tongue
● Saliva, secreted by the salivary glands, is
mixed with the chewed food by the
tongue.
● Tongue also contains taste buds due to
which we sense bitter, sour, salty or sweet
taste.

Functions of the
Digestive System
Splitting of complex food materials into
simpler molecules by hydrolysis so that
they can be easily absorbed by the
intestine is the main function of
digestive system.
● Man and other animals have holozoic
nutrition i.e., solid form of food.
Complete digestion process takes place in
following four steps
Ingestion of Food
● Ingestion takes place in buccal cavity.
● Saliva lubricates the food and binds the food
particles together to form bolus.
● Salivary gland have starch spitting enzyme
ptyalin.
● Parotid gland is the largest salivary gland.
Digestion of Food
Digestion in Mouth
In mouth, salivary amylase acts on
starch.
Starch
(Complex form)
Maltose
(Simple
Ptyalin
→
form)
Digestion in Stomach
● The food passes down through the
oesophagus into stomach.
● Now food is mixed with gastric juice
and hydrochloric acid which
disinfect the food and creates acidic
medium.
● Pepsin digests proteins and converts
them into peptones.
● Rennin convert milk into curd.
● Digested food now is called chyme.
Digestion in Duodenum
● Chyme moves to duodenum.
● Food is mixed with bile (liver) to breakdown
fats into smaller globules.
● Trypsin acts upon proteins and break them
into polypeptides. Amylase converts starch
into simple sugar.
● Lipase convert fats into fatty acids and
glycerol.
Digestion in Intestine
● Food passes into ileum and mixes with
intestinal juice, where
¡ Maltase converts maltose into glucose
¡ Lactase converts lactose into glucose
and galactose
¡ Sucrase converts sucrose into glucose and
fructose
¡ Trypsin digests the peptides into amino
acids

Absorption and Assimilation of
Digested Food
● Ileum’s internal surface has finger-like
folds called villi.
● It helps in absorption of food.
● Intestinal juice is alkaline in nature.
● pH of saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic
juice and intestinal juice is respectively
6.8, 2.0, 7.0 and 8.5.
Ejection of Unwanted Food
● Digested food passes into large intestine.
● Large intestine cannot absorb food, but
absorbs much of the water.
● The remaining semi solid waste is called
faeces and is passed into rectum.
● It is expelled out through anus.
Roughage
● Roughage is another term for dietary
fibres e.g., Natural food, dalia etc.
● It does not provide energy but only helps
in retaining water in the body.
SOME DIGESTIVE
GLANDS
Liver
● It is the largest gland of the human body
and secretes bile juice, which is stored in
gall bladder.
● It regulates the quantity of glucose in the
blood by converting extra glucose (if any)
into glycogen or glycogen (during
deficiency of glucose) is converted into
glucose.
● It destroys dead RBC and regulates body
temperature. It converts excess of amino
acid into ammonia (which is converted
into urea by Ornithine cycle). Urea
comes out from the body through kidney.
● If there is any obstruction in bile duct,
liver cells stop taking bilirubin from the
blood, consequently it spreads
throughout the body which is called
jaundice.
● Liver is an important body organ in
investigation of a person’s death that has
been due to poison in food.
Pancreas
● It is the second-largest gland of the
human body and contains islets of
Langerhans and exocrine part secreting
enzymes for carbohydrate, protein and
nucleic acid digestion.
● The most common is the β-cells, which
secretes insulin, a hormone deficiency
of which causes diabetes melitus.
● Excess of insulin causes hypoglyaemia,
in which one loses the reproducing
capacity and vision.
Intestinal Glands
Crypts of Lieberkuhn and Brunner’s
glands are intestinal glands and secrete
intestinal juice which is alkaline in nature.
RESPIRATORY
SYSTEM
Respiration is a catabolic process in
which the respired oxygen is used in the
oxidation of food resulting in the release of
energy. It is brought about by respiratory
organs.

Human Respiratory System
● Overall passage of air in humans is as
follows:
Nostrils → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea
→ Bronchi → Bronchioles → Alveoli →
Cells→ Blood.
● The human respiratory system is shown
in the following diagram.
Types of Respiration
Aerobic Respiration
● The respiration taking place in the
presence of oxygen is known as aerobic
respiration.
● This respiratory oxygen oxidises the
substance into carbon dioxide, water
and energy, as follows
Glucose + O2 →Carbon dioxide
+ Water + Energy.
● In this process, each glucose molecule is
converted into two molecules of pyruvic
acid by the process, called glycolysis. It
takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell.
The pyruvic acid formed, releases energy
with the formation of carbon dioxide and
water (in Kreb’s cycle which occur in
mitochondria).
Anaerobic Respiration
● The respiration taking place in the
absence of oxygen is known as
anaerobic respiration.
● It is found in endoparasites like
roundworm. In this process, the
respiratory substances are incompletely
oxidised to carbon dioxide and alcohol.
Glucose →
yeast
Carbon dioxide +
ethyl alcohol
muscles +Energy (in plants)
Glucose → Lactic acid
+ Energy (in animals)
PHASES OF AEROBIC
RESPIRATION
External Respiration
(Breathing or Ventilation of
Lungs)
● It involves inspiration and expiration of
air.
● Inspiration is the process of intake of air.
During inspiration, muscles of the
diaphragm contract and diaphragm
flattens.
● The lower ribs are raised upward and
outwards. The chest cavity enlarges, the
air pressure in the lungs gets decreased
and air rushes into the lungs.
● Expiration is breathing out of air. During
expiration, relaxation of muscles of the
ribs and diaphragm takes place.
● Diaphragm again become dome-shaped.
Chest cavity is reduced and air is
forced outwards through nose and
trachea.
● Breathing rate in humans is 18 20 - times
per min.
● The exchange of gases, i.e., oxygen and
carbon dioxide takes place due to the
difference in their partial pressures.
Internal Respiration
(Oxidation of Food)
● It is a complex process in which food is
broken down to release energy.
● Transportation of oxygen takes place by
haemoglobin of blood. Whereas
transportation of only 10-20% carbon
dioxide takes place by haemoglobin of
blood.
● Approximately 400 ml water is lost
through breathing everyday.

Human Respiratory System
■ Respiration being a catalytic process, also
reduces the weight of the body.
■ Larynx or voice box or Adam’s apple
produces sound. It has a small flap of
cartilage called the epiglottis, which
prevents the food from entering the trachea.
■ Purring sound in cats is due to the
vibration of false vocal cord.
■
In hippopotamus, true vocal cord is absent.
■ Total Lung Capacity (TLC) = 6000 mL
■ Residual Volume (RV) = 1200 mL
■ Tidal Volume (TV) = 500-600 ml
CIRCULATORY
SYSTEM
● It is a transport system that supplies the
useful material and removes the waste
from the body cells.
It consists of heart, blood vessels and
blood.
HEART
● Heart is a thick, muscular, contractile,
automatic pumping organ of blood
vascular system.
● The chamber which receives the blood
from body tissues are called auricles and
the chambers of heart which pump blood
to body tissues are called ventricles.
● There is a thin two layered sac around
the heart known as pericardium, filled
with a watery fluid called pericardial
fluid, which allows frictionless
movements of heart and protects it from
mechanical shocks.
● Fishes have only two-chambered heart
(one auricle and one ventricle).
● In amphibians, heart is
three-chambered.
● In crocodile, birds and mammals, the
heart is divided into four chambers (two
auricles and two ventricles).
● Reptilian heart is structurally threechambered but is functionally fourchambered (i.e., incomplete fourchambered) except in crocodile.
● A new born baby’s heart weight is about
20 g.
● The average weight of heart in men
is 280-340 g, while in women is
230-280 g.

Human Heart
Angina pectoris Pain in heart muscles, appearing as chest pain. It is caused due to
obstruction in coronary artery.
Tachycardia Increased rate of heartbeat.
Bradycardia Decreased rate of heartbeat.
Heart attack Breathlessness, palpitations, pain in the chest, unconsciousness
appear suddenly (Nitroglycerine is used for the treatment).
Heart block When heart beat is not passed to the ventricles properly. This is the
defect of conducting system of the heart.
Coronary thrombosis Due to the formation of clot in coronary artery.
Myocardial infarction It is the death of a part of heart muscle following cessation of blood
supply to it. It is acute heart attack.
● The circulation of blood through the whole
body can be shown as
● To pump out blood, the heart chamber
undergoes alternate contraction called
systole and relaxation called diastole. The
regular sequence of these systole and
diastole causes the heart sound Lub and
Dub.
● Arteries carry pure blood from the heart
while veins carry impure blood to the heart.
● Human heart beat is myogenic in nature,
i.e., initiated by a patch of modified heart
muscles itself without requiring an external
stimulation. This patch is called SA node
(sino-auricular node) or pacemaker.
● When SA-node becomes defective, i.e., it
does not generate cardiac impulses, it can
be cured by surgical grafting of an artificial
pacemaker (an electric device) in the chest
of the patient. It stimulate the heart
electrically at regular intervals.
● The normal rate of heartbeat at rest is
about 70-72 times per minute. In a newly
born baby, heartbeat rate is about 140 per
minute.
● During heavy exercise it may be high as
170-200 times per minute.
BLOOD
● Blood is a fluid connective tissue and
composed of blood corpuscles, plasma and
platelets.
● It is slightly alkaline is nature (pH 7.4).
● Its volume in an adult is 5.8 L.
● The oxygenated or pure blood is bright red
while the deoxygenated blood is purple
coloured (Darker shade of red).
● People who live at high altitudes have more
blood than those who live in low regions.
This extra blood supplies additional
oxygen to body cells.
● During blood clotting fibrinogen
changes into fibrin by thrombin
which is obtained from thromboplastin in the presence of Ca2+.
● The haemoglobin content of adult
female varies from 13.5-14.5%
whereas in adult male its amount
varies from 14.5-15.5% Haemoglobin
count is highest in the foetus and is
about 23 g per 100 mL of blood at
birth.
Blood Vessels
Blood vessels are of three types
Arteries
● These are thick walled blood vessels
which carry the blood away from the
heart to various body parts. These are
deep seated in the body and have no
valves in them.
● These carry oxygenated blood except
the pulmonary artery which carries
deoxygenated blood to the lungs. In
arteries, blood flows at a high
pressure and a higher speed.
Veins
● These are thin walled blood vessels
and carry blood away from various
body parts towards the heart. These
have valves in them to prevent
back flow of blood in them. Blood
flows at low pressure and at a lower
speed.
● These carry deoxygenated blood
except the pulmonary vein which
carries oxygenated blood to the heart.
Capillaries
● These are the thinnest blood vessels
and connect arteries to the veins.
● These help in exchange of materials
like the nutrients, gases, waste
products etc., between blood and
cells.

Blood Cells
Erythrocytes (RBCs)
● Red blood cells contain the blood’s haemoglobin
and distribute oxygen.
● RBCs are the most abundant cells.
● Mature red blood cells lack a
nucleus and organelles in
mammals. However, in camel
and llama it is nucleated.
● One RBC contains about 280
haemoglobin molecules.
Leukocytes (WBCs)
These are part of the body’s
immune system; they destroy and
remove old or aberrant cells and
cellular debris, as well as attack
infectious agents and foreign
substances. These are much less
in number than RBCs (1 : 600).
Thrombocytes
(Platelets)
It is responsible for blood clotting
(coagulation). It changes
fibrinogen into fibrin.
Blood Pressure (BP)
● The pressure created by the blood on the walls of
the blood vessels due to the repeated pumping of
heart is called blood pressure. It is measured by
sphygmomanometer.
● It can be felt at certain places in our body viz,
wrist of the hands etc.
● Blood pressure is recorded as systolic/diastolic.
Blood pressure in a normal person is 120 80/
mmHg. Factors affecting blood pressure are age,
cardiac output, total peripheral resistance etc.
● If a person has persistent high
blood pressure then it is called
hypertension and persistent
high blood pressure is 150/90
mm Hg. Factors responsible are
over eating, fear, worry, anxiety,
sorrow etc. Hypotension is
condition of low blood pressure,
i.e., persistent 100/50 mm Hg.
● Electrocardiograph (ECG) is
used to check proper working of
heart by using electrodes.
432 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Plasma Lymph
It contains 92% water, 8% blood plasma
proteins and trace amounts of other materials
Lymph contains a variety of substances
including proteins, salts, glucose, fats, water
and WBCs.
It is cell free part of blood, contain salts,
considerable amount of proteins as well as
more or less all constituents of body.
It is modified tissue fluid, contains cells like
lymphocyte and monocytes, salt and small
amount of proteins. It is colourless.
It flows within blood vessels. It flows within lymphatic vessels.
It takes part in nutrition, excretion, respiration,
etc., by transporting various materials and helps
in the defence mechanism of the body by
producing antibodies.
It supplies nutrition to tissue devoid of blood
supply, takes part in fat absorption and
defence mechanism of the body.
It can coagulate because it contains fibrinogen
and prothrombin.
It can coagulate but very slowly because it
contains these two in small quantities.
SKELETAL SYSTEM
The human skeleton consists of both fused
and individual bones supported and
supplemented by ligaments, tendons,
muscles and cartilage.
It is divided into two parts
Axial Skeleton (80 Bones)
● It includes skull, vertebral column and
bones of chest (ribs and sternum).
● Vertebral column is responsible for the
upright position of the human body.
● Most of the body weight is located at the
back of the vertebral column. It provides
flexibility to the neck and protection to
spinal cord.
Appendicular
Skeleton (126 Bones)
Their function is to make locomotion
possible and to protect the major organs of
locomotion, digestion, excretion and
reproduction.

● Tendons join the muscles and bones.
● The muscles which join bone to bone are
called ligaments.
Diseases of Skeletal System
● Hard tissue deposits over articular
cartilage along with higher secretion of
synovial fluid causing pain and stiffness
lead to rheumatoid arthritis. (An auto
immune disease).
● Tearing of articular cartilage and
development of bony lumps at places
causing pain, stiffness and permanent
bending lead to osteoarthritis.
● Osteoporosis is loss of bone density due
to excessive absorption of calcium and
phosphorus from the bone.
● Osteopetrosis is a hereditary disease
marked by abnormally dense bone and by
the common occurrence of fractures of
affected bone.
● Birds have spongy bones with air filled
spaces, called pneumatic bones.
● Rigor mortis is the state of body
stiffening after death.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 433
● Chronic fatigue is the inability of a
muscle to contract due to depletion
of its chemicals and lactic acid
accumulation by repeated contraction.
A completely fatigued muscle refuses to
respond to nervous stimuli.
Muscular System
● Human body has about 639 types of
muscles.
● Muscles specialised to contraction are
of three types, i.e., striated, unstriated
and cardiac.
● Striated muscles Also called skeletal
muscles or voluntary muscles. They are
present in limbs, tongue, pharynx etc.
● Unstriated muscles These are
involuntary muscles and present in
urinary bladder, in walls of large blood
vessels and alimentary canal.
● Cardiac muscles They are involuntary,
striated and non-fatigued fibres which
are found in the wall of heart, where
they form myocardium. They generate
their own wave of excitation.
EXCRETORY SYSTEM
The process of removal of nitrogenous
wastes from the body is called excretion.
The organs of excretion are called
excretory organs.
Excretory Organ Animal

Ammonotelic Animals
These animal excrete nitrogen in the
form of ammonia, e.g., aquatic
invertebrates Amoeba, Hydra, Prawn,
Pila, and freshwater fishes, bony fishes,
Frog’s tadpole.
Ureotelic Animals
They excrete nitrogen in the form of urea,
e.g., mammal (man), frogs, toads, other
amphibians and cartilaginous fishes like
sharks.
Uricotelic Animals
They excrete the nitrogenous wastes in the
form of uric acid, e.g., Reptiles, snakes,
lizards, crocodiles and birds.
Human Excretory System
The human excretory system includes—the
kidneys (two), ureters (two), urinary bladder
(one) and urethra (one).
Kidney
● It is bean-shaped, chocolate brown organ
lying in the abdomen, one on each side of
the vertebral column just below the
diaphragm.
● The left kidney is placed a little higher
than the right kidney (but reverse in
rabbit).
● These form the urine and controls
osmotic pressure within the organism with
respect to external environment.
● Nephrons are the functional and
structural unit of kidney. Each nephron is
made up of Bowman’s capsule and renal
tubule. Renal tubule is made up of
Proximal Convolutid Tubule (PCT),
Henle’s loop, Distal Convoluted Tubule
(DCT) and Collecting Tubule (CT).
Ureters
These bring the urine downward and open
into urinary bladder.
Urinary Bladder
● It temporarily stores the urine.
● It can hold about 0.5-1.0 L of urine.
● It is absent in birds. In both reptiles and
birds, ureters and rectum, opens into a
common sac called cloaca.
Urethra
● It is a muscular and tubular structure
which extends from neck of bladder to
outside. In females, this tube is small and
serves as a passage of urine only.
● In males, it is long and functions as a
common passage for urine and spermatic
fluids.
434 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Urine
● It is a pale yellow coloured fluid due to
presence of urochrome pigment.
● It is acidic in nature (pH 6.0) and is slightly
heavier than water.
● It has a faint aromatic odour due to urinoid.
Daily urine output in normal adult is
1.5-1.8 L.
● Chemical composition of urine : water is
95-96%, urea is 2% and some other substance
like uric acid, creatinine, etc., are 2-3%.
● The urine on standing gives a pungent smell.
It is due to conversion of urea into ammonia
by bacteria.
● Haemodialysis is the process of removal of
excesss urea from the blood of patient using
artificial kidney.
● Kidney stone are generally calcium oxalate
crystals.
NERVOUS SYSTEM
● The nervous system provides the fastest
means of communication within the body so
that suitable response to stimuli can be made
at once.
● Nervous system is found only in animals and
absent in plants.
● In most animals, the nervous system consists
of two parts—central and peripheral nervous
system.
Central Nervous
System (CNS)
Brain
● Brain lies in the cranium of skull.
● Cerebrospinal fluid is present in brain and
spinal cord.
The functions of brain parts are as
follows
Forebrain
● Cerebrum leads to consciousness,
storage of memory having
information.
● Thalamus deals with touch, visual
system, sleep and wakefulness.
● Hypothalamus deals with water
balance in body, behavioral patterns
of sex, sleep, stress emotions etc. It
also regulates pituitary hormones
and metabolism of fat,
carbohydrate water and maintain
body temperature (homeostasis).
Midbrain
It deals with visual analysis, auditory
etc.
Broca’s area is present in brain and
is related with speech production, while
Wernick’s area of brain is related
with understanding of speech.
Hindbrain
● Cerebellum controls coordination
of accurate movements and
balancing.
● Medulla oblongata is long
connecting part of brain to spinal
cord. It deals with control of heart
beats, blood vessels, breathing,
salivary secretion and mostly reflex
and involuntary (uncontrolled)
movements.
Nobel Prize in Medicine 2016
The Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine 2016 was awarded to
Yoshinori Ohsumi “for his discoveries of
mechanisms for autophagy.
The word ‘autophagy’ originates from
the Greek words auto, meaning ‘self and
phageil meaning to ‘eat’. It is an
evolutionarily conserved process in
which the eukaryotic cell can recycle
part of its own content.

blinking of the eye when an object comes
near to our eyes suddenly, rapid
withdrawal of hand while coming near to
heat, knee jerk reflex etc.
Acquired reflex action is also called
conditioned reflex as dependent on past
experience, training and learning.
It was first demonstrated by Ivan Petrovich
Pavlov e.g. learning, dancing, cycling,
swimming, singing and driving etc are
controlled by spinal chord. It is under
cerebral control during learning.
Peripheral Nervous
System (PNS)
● It is a collective term for the nervous
system structures that do not lie within
the CNS.
● It is composed of cranial and spinal
nerves. There are 10 pairs of cranial
nerves in fishes and amphibians and
12 pairs in rest of the higher chordates.
● There are 10 pairs of spinal nerves
found in fishes and amphibians and
31 pairs in humans.
● The PNS is divided into two divisions:
Somatic Nervous System (SNS) and
Autonomous Nervous System (ANS).
● It is a part of peripheral nervous system
that relays impulses from the CNS to
skeletal muscles.
Autonomous Nervous
System (ANS)
It is also a part of peripheral nervous
system that transmits impulses from the
CNS to involuntary organs and smooth
muscles of the body. Autonomic nervous
system consists of two divisions
1. Sympathetic Nervous System
increases defence system of body
against adverse conditions. It is active
in stress condition, e.g., pain, fear and
anger.
2. Parasympathetic Nervous System
provides relaxation, comfort, pleasure
at the time of rest. It helps in the
restoration and conservation of
energy.
● Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test
that measures and records the electrical
activity of our brain.
SENSE ORGANS
Eye
Eyes are the sensitive detectors of light. The
human eye can distinguish about 10 million
colours. It consists of three parts
Sclerotic Layer
It is the outermost, bony layer, which
includes
● Cornea the clear, dome-shaped tissue,
covering the front of the eye.
● Conjunctiva, the continuation of upper
eyelid.
Choroid Layer
It is the middle layer and consists of
1. Pupil is the black hole in the centre
of the iris. It changes size as the
amount of light changes.
2. Ciliary muscles regulates the lens
curvature.
3. Iris is the coloured part of the eye. It
controls the amount of light that enters
the eye by changing the size of the
pupil.
4. Lens is a biconvex transparent
circular solid located just behind the
iris. It focuses light onto the retina.
Retina
● Light sensitive tissue that lies at the
back of the eye. It contains millions of
photoreceptors (rods and cones) that
convert light rays into electrical impulses
that are relayed to the brain via the optic
nerve.
● The image formed on retina is real and
inverted.

The Eye
● Rods are highly sensitive to dim light and
contain a reddish purple pigment called
rhodopsin. Night vision involves mostly rods
(not cones).
● Cones are sensitive to bright light, hence
differentiate the colours.
● The fovea centralis is the area of sharpest
vision due to high concentration of cones.
● The blind spot (optic disc) has no rods and
cone cells, hence no image is form in this
region.
Eye Defects
Nearsightedness (Myopia)
● A condition in which nearby objects are seen
more clearly than distant objects because
light is focused in front of the retina, not on it.
It can be corrected by using concave glasses.
Farsightedness (Hypermetropia)
● A condition in which distant objects are seen
more clearly than nearby objects because light
is focused behind the retina, not on it.
● It can be corrected by using convex glasses.
Astigmatism
● A condition in which the lens is warped,
causing images not to focus properly on the
retina.
● The cylindrical glass can correct the defect.
● Colour blindness also called Daltonism is
caused due to deficiency of cones. While
night blindness is due to deficiency of
rhodopsin in rods.
● Retina of Owl contains only rods while fowl
contains only cones.
● The eyes of carnivores like cat, dog, iron sea
etc, glow in night due to tapetum lucidum.
Eyes are most sensitive to yellow green
colour. Bees can see ultraviolet light.
Presbyopia
● It is a reduction in pupil size and the loss of
accommodation or focusing capability with
age, leading to a substantial decrease in light
received at the retina.
● Bifocal lens can correct the defect.
● Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of
conjunctiva by bacteria.

● Ears are meant for both balancing
and hearing.
● It can be divided into three parts
as External ear (pinna +
external auditory canal), Middle
ear (tympanic cavity) and Internal
ear (bony and membranous
labyrinth).
● Hearing is controlled by auditory
area of temporal lobe of cerebral
cortex.
● Human ear can receive the sound
ranging between 60-80 decibel.
● Human ear is sensitive to sounds
frequency 50-20,000 cycles/sec.
● Defects of ear are : Otalgia ear,
ache (Pain in ear); Othitis media
(Acute infection of middle ear)
Labyrithine disease (malfunction
of inner ear).
Nose
● Nose is a sense organ for smell or
olfaction. It contains
1. Olfactory cells which are more
chemosensitive than taste cells.
2. Olfactory stimuli such as,
chloroform and ammonia are
irritating and can cause tearing.
● Dogs have an acute olfactory sense.
They can trace people because they
can distinguish between the odours
of different persons.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 437
REPRODUCTIVE
SYSTEM
● The process by which new individuals are
produced from their parents is called
reproduction and the organs which are
used for this process, collectively
constitute the reproductive system.
● Reproduction is of two types, i.e., asexual
and sexual.
● In asexual reproduction, only one parent
is involved and sex cells are not involved.
● In sexual reproduction, two parents are
involved and formation and fusion of
gametes takes place.
Mode of
Reproduction
Organism
Fission (asexual) Amoeba, bacteria,
flatworm etc.
Budding (asexual) Hydra, yeast and sponge
etc.
Syngamy (sexual) Cockroach, frog and
human being etc.
Male Reproductive System

more active.
Cowper’s gland 2 Secrete an alkaline
white lubricating fluid.
Penis (have rich
blood supply)
2 Pass urine and
deposit sperm in
female genital tract.
● Males can produce spermatozoa
(sperm) throughout their life from age
of 13-14 years. The growth of hairs on
body is due to masculine hormones.
Female Reproductive

Female Reproductive System
● After maturity the ovary releases an
ovum (egg cell) after every 28 days.
● The connection between developing
embryo and mother is made by
placenta. It supplies blood, organic and
inorganic nutrients, hormones,
antibodies etc.
● The embryo develops for nine months in
uterus. It is called gestation period.
● Child is delivered after its development
and mother produces milk to nourish
the child (lactation).
● The first milk which comes out from the
mother’s mammary gland just after
child birth is called colostrum.
● This milk is rich in protein, antibodies
which imparts immunity to new born
baby.
Menstrual Cycle
● Reproductive period of a human female
extends from puberty (10-14 years) to
menopause (40-50 years).
● The release of the first menstrual flow or
period is called menarche.
● Menarche marks the onset of
reproductive life and onset of puberty in
females.
● Menopause is stopping of ovulation and
menses. It normally occurs between the
age of 45 to 55. This stage onwards,
woman lose the ability to reproduce.
● The periodic vaginal bleeding during
menstrual cycle is called menstruation.
● On an average menstural cycle is
completed in 28 days.
● It is absent during pregnancy, may be
suppressed during lactation and
permanently stops at menopause. About
13 mature eggs are released from two
ovaries of female in a year.
● Menstrual cycle is controlled by FSH,
LH, oestrogen and progesterone
hormones.
Birth Control Methods or
Contraception Methods
● The prevention of union of sperm and
ovum is known as contraception. The
various methods used for it are
diaphragm, contraceptive pills,
tubectomy, vesectomy, copper-T etc.
● Amniocentesis or amniotic fluid test is
technique of finding out sex and disorder
of foetus.

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
● It includes endocrine or ductless glands.
Their secretion is known as hormones.
● Different types of hormones are
● Steroids, e.g., oestradiol, testosterone,
androsterone, aldosterone, cortisol and
cortisone.
● Peptides, e.g., insulin, glucagon,
pituitary hormones, parathormone and
relaxin.
● Amino acid derivatives, e.g., adrenaline,
noradrenaline and thyroid hormones.
Various glands are:
Hypothalamus
It is a part of forebrain and regulates the
pituitary glands and maintains body
temperature (homeostasis).
Pituitary Gland or
Hypophysis
● It governs other endocrine glands like
thyroid, adrenal and gonads.
● Pituitary gland is also known as master
gland.
Thyroid Gland
● It is the largest endocrine gland and
located in neck region.
● It is the ‘pace setter’ of the endocrine
system. It secretes
1. Thyroxine, which regulates BMR
(Basal Metabolic Rate), physical,
mental and sexual development.
2. Thyrocalcitonin secreted by the
C-cells and regulates the calcium
homeostasis (lowers calcium level).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 439
Pancreas
It is both an exocrine and endocrine gland.
The islet of Langerhans (endocrine) have
three major types of cells
1. Alpha-Cells secretes glucagon hormone
which increases blood sugar level.
2. Beta-Cells secretes insulin, which
decreases the amount of sugar in the
blood.
3. Delta-Cells secretes somatostatin
which is an anti-growth factor.
Adrenal Gland
● It is also known as emergency gland.
(a) Cortex (outer layer)
(b) Medulla (inner layer) It secretes two
important hormones— Epinephrine or
adrenaline and nor-epinephrine or
noradrenaline
● It increases the blood glucose level, blood
pressure and cardiac output.
Pineal Gland
● It is situated in the brain and also known
as clockwork gland.
● It regulates the ovaries and has an effect
on the biological rhythm.
GONADS
These secrete steroid hormones.
Ovarian Hormones
(Oestrogens)
It helps in the development of primary and
secondary sexual characters (oestradiol,
oestriol and estrogen). Hypersecretion of
androgenic steroids in female results in
stopping of menstruation, hairs on face and
breasts.
Testicular Hormones
(Androgens)
These are produced by Leydig cells of
testes.It stimulate growth, maturation and
maintenance of male gonads and
development of secondary sexual characters,
e.g., testosterone, androsterone etc.
HEALTH
Health is the functional or metabolic
efficiency of a living being. In human, it is
the general condition of a person’s mind,
body and spirit, usual meaning, to be free
from illness, injury or pain.
DISEASES
It is a condition of the body or its part in
which functions are disturbed. The
diseases may be broadly classified into
two types, i.e., congenital and acquired.
Congenital Diseases
These are anatomical or physiological
abnormalities present from birth.
They may be caused by
● A single gene mutation (alkaptonuria,
phenylketonuria, albinism, sickle-cell
anaemia, haemophilia and colour
blindness).
● Chromosomal aberrations (Down’s
syndrome, Klinefelter’s syndrome and
Turner’s syndrome).
● Environmental factors (cleft palate
and harelip). Unlike the gene and
chromosome induced congenital
defects, environmentally caused
abnormalities are not transmitted to the
children.
Acquired Diseases
These diseases develop after birth.
They are further of two types, i.e.,
communicable and non-communicable.
1. Communicable (infectious)
diseases are caused by pathogenic
micro-organisms, such as bacteria,
viruses, parasites or fungi; the
diseases can be spread, directly or
indirectly, from one person to
another. Infectious diseases, are also
known as transmissible diseases.
2. Non-communicable (noninfectious) diseases are not passed
by organisms among people, but
come from genetic or lifestyle
factors.
440 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
COMMUNICABLE
DISEASES
These are the diseases which may pass or
carried from one human or animal to
other.
Communicable diseases are illness caused
by germs such as bacteria, viruses and
spread by an infected person, animals or
object to other persons.
Viral Diseases
Viruses are parasitic and causes a number
of diseases.
Bird Flu( ) H N5 1
Bird flu (Avian influenza) is a disease
caused by an influenza virus-A, that
primarily affect birds.
The following persons may be on higher risk
for developing the bird flu
● Farmers and others, who work with
poultry.
● Travellers, visiting affected countries.
● Those who have touched an infected
bird.
● Those who eat raw or undercooked
poultry meat, eggs from infected birds.
Symptoms
Fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and
eye infection (conjunctivitis).
Treatment
Treatment with the antiviral medication
oseltamivir (tamiflu) or zanamivir (relenza)
may make the disease less severe.
Oseltamivir may also be prescribed for
persons, who live in the same house as
those diagnosed with avian flu.
Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS)
It is a serious form of pneumonia. It is
caused by a virus that was first identified in
2003. Infection with the SARS virus causes
acute respiratory distress (severe breathing
difficulty) and sometimes death.
Symptoms
Cough usually starts 2-3 days after other
symptoms like Fever, headache and muscle
aches.
Treatment
Antibiotics to treat bacteria that
cause pneumonia. Antiviral medications.
High doses of steroids to reduce swelling in
the lungs. Oxygen, breathing support
(mechanical ventilation) or chest therapy.
Hepatitis
Hepatitis is a swelling and inflammation of
the liver. It is not a condition, but is often
used to refer a viral infection of the liver.
Hepatitis can be caused by
● Immune cells in the body attacking the
liver and causing autoimmune hepatitis.
Infections from viruses (such as
hepatitis-A, B or C), bacteria or
parasites. Liver damage from alcohol,
poisonous mushrooms or other poisons.
● Medications, such as an overdose of
acetaminophen, can cause harm or death
also.
Symptoms
Abdominal pain or distention. Breasts
development in males. Dark urine and
pale or clay coloured stools. Fatigue,
general itching, fever, usually low-grade
jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
and loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and
weight loss.
AIDS
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) is a disease of the human immune
system caused by the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). AIDS was
first recognised by the Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981.
HIV Infection
AIDS is a condition caused by HIV
infection. The condition gradually
destroys the immune system, which
makes it harder for the body to fight
infections.
Transmission
HIV can be spread by the following
● Through sexual contact i.e. oral, vaginal
and anal sex.
● Through blood transfusions, accidental
needle sticks or needle sharing.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 441
● From mother to child: A pregnant woman
can transmit virus to her foetus through
their shared blood circulation or a nursing
mother can pass it to her baby through
breast’s milk.
Test for AIDS
● Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay/
Enzyme Immuno Assay (ELISA/EIA)
● Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay/ Indirect
Fluorescent Antibody Assay (RIP/IFA)
● Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
● Western Blot Confirmatory Test.
NON-COMMUNICABLE
DISEASES
There are various kinds of
non-communicable diseases, which affect
the health of human beings. Some of the
common non- communicable diseases are
Diabetes
Diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too
much glucose (sugar) in the blood. There are
two main types of diabetes
Type 1
Diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t
produce enough insulin to function properly or
the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. This is
known as insulin resistance.
Type 2
Diabetes is far more common than type 1
diabetes, which occurs when the body doesn’t
produce any insulin at all.
Symptoms
Symptoms common to both types of diabetes
include
(i) Feeling very thirsty.
(ii) Urinating frequently, particularly at night.
(iii) Feeling very tired.
(iv) Weight loss and loss of muscle bulk.
Cancer
It is uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in
the body. Some diseases cause emergence of
tumours in body. These are called neoplastic
diseases. This includes from a minor role to a
lethal cancer.
Causes of Cancer
● Cancer is induced by physical,
chemical and biological factors or
agents. These are called carcinogens
or cancer causing agents. Ionising
radiations such as X-rays, γ-rays and
non-ionising radiations such as
ultraviolet (UV) damage the DNA
leading to neoplastic transformation.
● Tobacco smoke contains chemical
carcinogens that causes lung cancer.
Viruses also cause cancer. These are
called oncogenic viruses as they have
genes called viral oncogenes.
Cancer Detection
and Diagnosis
Leukaemia or blood cancer can be
detected based on biopsy and
histopathological studies of the tissue
and blood and bone marrow tests for
increased cell counts. Cancers of
internal organs are detected using
techniques such as Radiography
Computed Tomography (RCT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
442 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Cancer Therapy
■ Cryo Surgery It is the technique of
using extreme rapid cooling that freeze
tissues, thereby destroy them. Rapid
cooling to temperature below freezing
point produces irreversible cell damage
and cell death occurs at 20°C to − 90°C.
■ Proton Therapy It is a type of
particle therapy, which uses a beam of
protons to irradiate diseased tissue,
most often in the treatment of cancer.
■ Radiation Therapy Radiation
therapy is a cancer treatment. Its goal is
to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours.
■ Stem Cell Transplantation Stem
cell transplants can be an effective
treatment for people with certain forms of
cancer, such as leukaemia and lymphoma.
■ Peripheral Blood Stem Cell
Transplantation (PBSCT) It is also
called peripheral stem cell support. This
procedure restore stem cells that has
been destroyed by high doses of
chemotherapy.
Heart Diseases
Some heart diseases are as follow
Angina Pectoris
Human with angina, experience pain in the
centre of the chest. The chest can feel
constricted and tight, but the pain can also be
oppressive, as if something is crushing your
chest. Pain starts in the centre of the chest
behind the breast bone (sternum) or on the left
side of the front of the chest. It can spread out to
other parts of your body like your arms and
stomach.
Myocardial Infarction
● It is commonly known as heart attack, results
from the interruption of blood supply to a part
of the heart, causing heart cells to die.
● This is most commonly due to occlusion
(blockage) of a coronary artery following the
rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic
plaque, which is an unstable collection of
lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids) and white
blood cells (especially macrophages) in the
wall of an artery.
● The result is ischemia (restriction in blood
supply) and ensuing oxygen, if left untreated
for a sufficient period of time, can cause
damage or death (infarction) of heart muscle
tissue (myocardium).
Heart Arrest
● It occurs when the heart is unable to provide
sufficient pump action to distribute blood flow
to meet the needs of the body. Heart arrest
can cause a number of symptoms including
shortness of breath, leg swelling and exercise
intolerance.
● The condition is diagnosed with
echocardiography and blood tests. Treatment
commonly consists of lifestyle measures such
as smoking cessation, light exercise including
breathing protocols, decreased salt intake and
other dietary changes and medications.
Arthritis
● It affects the musculoskeletal system,
specifically the joints. It is the main cause of
disability among people over 55 years of age in
industrialised countries.
● Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) It is a long-term
disease that leads to inflammation of the
joints and surrounding tissues. It can also
affect other organs.
Osteoarthritis
It is a joint inflammation that results
from cartilage degeneration. It can be
caused by ageing, heredity and injury
from trauma or disease. The most
common symptom of osteoarthritis is
pain in the affected joint(s) after
repetitive use.
Gout
Gout is a kind of arthritis. It can cause
an attack of sudden burning pain,
stiffness and swelling in a joint,
usually a big toe. These attacks can
happen over and over unless gout is
treated. Overtime, they can harm
your joints, tendons and other tissues.
Gout is most common in men.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
● Gonorrhoea It is caused by
bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Anyone who has any type of sexual
contact can catch gonorrhoea. The
infection can be spread by contact
with the mouth, vagina, penis or
anus.
● Syphilis It is a sexually
transmitted infection caused by the
spirochete bacterium Treponema
pallidum sub-species pallidum.
The primary route of transmission
is through sexual contact; it may
also be transmitted from mother to
foetus during pregnancy or at birth,
resulting in congenital syphilis.
● Genital herpes It is a Sexually
Transmitted Infection (STI) caused
by the Herpes Simplex Virus
(HSV).
● Trichomoniasis It is a sexually
transmitted infection caused by the
parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.
Mental Disorder
A mental disorder or mental illness is
a psychological pattern or anomali,
potentially reflected in behaviour, that
is generally associated with distress or
disability and which is not considered
part of normal development of a
person’s culture. This may be
associated with particular regions or
functions of the brain or rest of the
nervous system, often in a social
context.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 443
Alzheimer’s Disease
It is a progressive mental deterioration
that can occur in middle or old age, due to
generalised degeneration of the brain. It is
the commonest cause of premature
senility.
DRUGS
A drug is a substance, which when taken
in, alters the body functions. Repeated use
of drugs particularly for obtaining quick
pleasure is called drug abuse.
Some Simple Drugs
Below are the types of simple drugs
Analgesic (Pain Killers)
These drugs act in various ways on the
peripheral and central nervous system;
they include paracetamol
(acetaminophen), the non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such
as the salicylates, narcotic drugs such as
morphine, synthetic drugs with narcotic
properties such as tramadol and various
others.
Anaesthetic
An anaesthetic is used to temporarily
reduce or take away sensation, usually so
that painful procedures or surgery can be
performed.
There are two types of anaesthetics
● General which make the patient
unconscious.
● Local which numb the part of the body
that would otherwise feel pain.
Antibiotics (Bactericidal)
These are powerful medicines that fight
bacterial infections. When used properly,
antibiotics can save lives. They either kill
bacteria or stop them for reproducing.
Antihistamines
These are medicines that can be used to
relieve severe itching and help in breaking
histamine cycle. It leads to thickening and
weeping of the skin and generally makes the
eczema worse and more likely to become
infected because scratching breaks the skin.
Tranquiliser
It is a drug that induces tranquility in an
individual. The minor tranquilisers induce a
feeling of calm and relaxation. Depending
on the medication and dosage, this can
range from feeling of mild euphoria to states
of drowsiness, confusion and lightedness.
Sedative
It is a substance that induces sedation by
reducing irritability or excitement. At higher
doses it may result in slurred speech,
staggering gait, poor judgment and slow,
uncertain reflexes.
Doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepines,
when used as a hypnotic induce sleep, tend
to be higher than amounts used to relieve
anxiety, whereas only low doses are needed
to provide a peaceful and calming sedative
effect.
Narcotic
It is originally referred medically to any
psychoactive compound with any
sleep-inducing properties.
Antipyretics
(Temperature Reduction)
These are drugs or herbs that reduce fever.
Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to over
ride an interleukin-induced increase in
temperature. The body then works to lower
the temperature, resulting in a reduction of
fever.
● Bacteria of cholera and TB was discovered
by Robert Koch.

Vaccination
● It is the process of artificial introduction of germs or the germ substance called
antigen into the body for developing resistance to a particular disease. The material
introduced into the body is called vaccine.
● A vaccine is a dead or weakened microbes. They are unable to produce disease as they
are less in number but they stimulate the body to produce antibodies.
● World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1974 officially launched a global vaccination
programme to protect children from six fatal diseases. Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus,
polio, TB (Tuberculosis) and measles. It was launched in India in 1985.
● BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) vaccine is given to protect against TB (Tuberculosis).

GENETICS
It is the study of heredity and
variations. The term ‘Genetics’ was
coined by W Bateson in 1905. Gregor
Johann Mondel (commonly called
Father of Genetics) proposed three
laws
(a) Law of Dominance It states that
crossing of plant with red and
white flower produced plants
only with red flower i.e.,
dominant trait appear and
recessive disappeared.
(b) Law of Segregation It states
that allele of a gene separate
during gamete formation. It is
also called law of purity of
genetics or law of splitting of
hybrids. It gives 3 : 1 ratio in F2
generation.
(c) Law of Independent
Assortment It states that two or
more genes assort independently
during inheritance. It gives 9 : 3 :
3 : 1 ratio in F2
generation.
Linkage is an exception to this
law.
● Test Cross The cross between
heterozygous F1
and homozygous
recessive is called test cross. In test
cross, the monohybrid ratio is 1 : 1
and dihybrid ratio is 1:1:1:1.
● Back Cross The cross between
heterozygous F1 hybrid and
homozygous dominant allele is
called back cross.
Some Important
Genetic Terms
● Phenotype It is the physical appearance of an
individual.
● Genotype It is the entire genetic complement
of an individual organism.
● Alleles The two individual genes in a
particular gene pair that occupies same locus
(position) on homologous pair of chromosome.
● Dominant and Recessive Traits (inherited
character) The traits may be dominant or
recessive depending upon the fact that on
crossing the individuals (which are
homozygous for a particular trait of same
character the trait which appears in the F1
generation is called dominant and the other
one is recessive.
● Hybrid An offspring, which is obtained from a
cross between two genetically different
parents.
● Linkage The phenomenon of genic
inheritance in which genes of a particular
chromosome show their tendency to inherit
together, i.e., tendency to retain their parental
combination even in the offsprings is known as
linkage.
● Mutation It is a sudden change of a gene (gene
mutation) or chromosome (chromosomal
mutation) from one form to another, which are
passed to the daughter cells.
● Heteroploidy It is the variation in
chromosome number.
● Pleiotropy It occurs when one gene
influences multiple phenotypic traits.

450 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Biotechnology
It deals with technique of using live
micro-organisms, their parts or processes for
the manufacture of useful or commercial
substances. It has two core techniques i.e.,
genetic engineering and technique to
facilitate the growth and multiplication of
only desired microbes. In genetic engineering
(also called recombinant DNA technology)
restriction endonucleases are very useful.
They cleave the DNA at specific locations
called restriction sites.
● Vectors are organisms or their parts used to
transfer the desired DNA from one
organism to another. The common vectors
are bacteriophage, cosmids, phagemids,
plasmids etc.
● Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
developed by Kary Mullis (1983) can clone
or amplify the small amount of DNA. It
involves denaturation, primer annealing
and polymerisation in the definite
sequence.
Applications of Biotechnology
A number of transgenic plants, medicines,
acids are produced through genetic
engineering.
Bt Cotton
It was developed to reduce the heavy reliance
on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a
chemical harmful only to a small fraction of
insects.
Bt Brinjal
It is a transgenic brinjal (also known as an egg
plant or aubergine) created by inserting a
crystal protein gene (Cry IAc) from the soil
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into the
genome of various brinjal varieties.
Golden Rice
● It is a variety of Oryza sativa (rice)
produced through genetic engineering
to biosynthesise beta-carotene, a
precursor of pro-vitamin-A in the
edible parts of rice. Golden rice was
developed as a fortified food to be used
in areas, where there is a shortage of
diet having vitamin-A.
● Golden Rice 2 produces up to 23
times more beta-carotene than the
original variety of golden rice. Golden
rice was created by lngo Potrykus of
the Institute of Plant Sciences at the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,
working with Peter Beyer of the
University of Freiburg.
● Carotene impart orange colour to
carrots and is the reason why
genetically modified rice is golden. For
the golden rice to make beta-carotene,
three new genes are inserted: two from
daffodils and the third from a
bacterium.
Flavr Savr
By the use of antisense RNA technology
the enzyme polygalacto-uronase, which
causes damage to pectin is deactivated
and the tomato is kept fresh for longer
duration.
Canola
It is either of rape seed (Brassica napus
L) or field mustard (Brassica campestris
L or Brassica rapavar). Its nodes are
used to produce edible oil suitable for
consumption by humans and livestock.
The oil is also suitable as biodiesel.
Dairy Products
● Cheese is prepared by the coagulation
of casein and other minor milk
proteins (curdling of milk) by an
enzyme rennin extracted from calf
gastric mucosa.
● Streptococcus and Lactobacillus
species are involved in the
manufacture of most cheese.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 451
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
It is Gram positive, soil-dwelling bacterium,
commonly used as a biological pesticide. The Cry
toxin found in the bacterium is extracted and used
as a pesticide. It also occurs naturally in the gut of
caterpillars of various types of moths and
butterflies, as well as on the dark surfaces of plants.
● In cheese manufacture,
micro-organisms are important in both
souring and ripening processes.
● Semisoft blue Roquefort cheese of
France is produced using the mold
Penicillium roqueforti.
● Yoghurt is a preserved milk product
having a distinct taste and a thick
texture than milk.
● Yoghurt is made by fermenting whole
milk with a mixture of Lactobacillus
bulgaricus, Streptococcus lactis and S.
thermophilus at 40° to 46°C.
Vitamins
● Vitamin C was the first vitamin to be
produced by a fermentation process
using Acetobacter, a wild bacterium.
● Bacteria used for industrial production
of vitamin-B12 are propionibacterium
shermanii, P. freundenreichii and
Pseudomonas denitrificans.
● Vitamin-B2
(Riboflavin) is synthesised
by many micro-organisms including
bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The fungus,
Ashbya gossypii is used for the
microbial production of vitamin-B2
.
Biotechnologies in
Human Health
● Monoclonal antibodies are made
outside the body by the hybrid cell
cultures known as hybridomas.
● Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are
antibodies that are identical because
they were produced by one type of
immune cell and are all clones of a
single parent cell.
● A biochip is a discrete collection of
gene fragments on a stamp-sized chip
that can be used to screen for the
presence of particular gene variants.
● Biochips allow rapid screening of gene
profiles, a tool that promises to have a
revolutionary impact on medicine and
society.
● Biochips can help in identifying precise
forms of cancer.
● Gene therapy is the treatment of disease
by replacing, altering or supplementing a
gene whose absence or abnormality is
responsible for the disease. Gene therapy is
unique as it employs the genetic material,
i.e. DNA, itself as the means of treatment.
DNA finger printing is the technique, in
which the banding pattern of DNA
fragments is compared and can be used in
many species, including human, to indicate
relativity. (used for rape victim, paternity,
other criminals).
● Human insulin or humulin is the first
genetically engineered pharmaceutical
product, developed by Eli Lilly and
company in 1982.
● Genentech, a California-based company,
have produced human growth hormone
(hGH) from genetically engineered
bacteria.
● Somatostatin is the first polypeptide,
which was expressed in E coli as a part of
the fusion peptide.
● BST or Bovine Somatotropin is produced
in a large quantity from milk production in
cows.
● In 1997, a transgenic cow ‘Rosie’
produced human alpha-lactalbumin
protein enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre).
● It is possible to cure phenylketonuria
disease by using recombinant DNA
techniques in early period of pregnancy.
● Urokinase is involved in dissolution of
blood clots. It has been synthesised in huge
quantity by using genetically engineered
bacteria with urokinase genes.

* Milk is pasteurised (preserved) by boiling it at 62.8° for 30 minutes (Low Temperature Holding
method or LTH) or at 71.7.°C for 15 seconds (high temperature holding method). These
treatments kill all bacteria.
Botany
● It is the branch of biology which
deals with plants, which are
considered as multicellular
ulcerates. The cells of these
organisms contain a cell wall
made up of cellulose and other
polysaccharides. Plants have the
ability to synthesise their own
food (autotrophic) in the
presence of sunlight, via the
process of photosynthesis.
● Plants have two main groups i.e.,
cryptogams (lower plants
without well defined flowers and
seeds) and phanerogams (higher
plants with well defined flowers
and seeds).
● Cryptogams further contains
thallophytes and pteridophytes
with bryophytes in between.
Here, thallophytes means those
plants which have thallus like
body i.e., without roots, leaves
and stem e.g., algae, fungi,
bacteria etc.
● All the plants of cryptogams are
considered as primitive as these
do not have well defined features
of plants like presence of phloem
(a tissue for food transport) and
presence of xylem (a tissue for
water transport etc).
● Phanerogams are well defined
advanced plants with proper roots,
leaves and stem and well
differentiated tissue system. These
can be categorised as
Gymnosperms (Naked Seed) and
Angiosperms (Covered seed)
plants.
■ Algae like Nostoc, Anabaena etc are
used as manure.
■ Sphagnum a genus of mosses is
used as fuel and antiseptic.
● Some plants catch insects to
fulfill their nitrogen requirement.
Such plants are called
insectivorous plants.
PLANT MORPHOLOGY
Plant morphology represents a study of the
development, form and structure of plants and by
implication, an attempt to interpret these on the
basis of similarity of plan and origin.
Classification of Plants
● Plant classification is the placing of known
plants into groups or categories to show their
relationship.
● Thus, plants are classified into group having
same characteristics.
● Thallophyta A phylum of plants of very
diverse habit and structure, e.g., Algae, fungi
and lichens.
● Bryophytes Have stems and leaves but lack
true vascular tissue and reproduce by spores
e.g., Mosses, hornworts, liverworts etc.
● Pteridophytes Vascular plants with leaves,
stems and roots, but lack both seeds and
flowers, e.g., Ferns, Lycopodium, horsetails etc.
● Gymnosperms Group of seed producing
plants. A plant that has seeds unprotected by an
ovary or fruit, e.g., Conifer, cycads, pine tree etc.
● Angiosperms (Vascular plants) A major group
of flowering plants. Their characteristics are the
possession of protected seeds or fruits, e.g.,
Rose, tulip, tomatoes etc.
Virus
The term virus was given by Pasteur. Virus was
discovered by Iwanowski in the extract of diseased
tobacco plant. Virus is a nucleoprotein entity which do
not have machinery of its own but can utilise the
synthetic machinery of living cell of other organisms for
its multiplication. Virus is considered to be a cellular,
i.e. without a cell.
Bacteria
Basically, bacteria are unicellular prokaryotes. Their
cell wall is generally, made up of peptidoglycans and
polysaccharides. Genetic material is not organised into
nucleus, i.e. a primitive nucleus is present (without a
nuclear membrane). All membrane bound cell
organelles are absent.
Flagella, if present is single-stranded, made up of
protein flagellin.
Gamete formation is absent.
454 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
PARTS OF A PLANT
Different parts of a plant perform different
function. Accordingly they are divided into
root, stem, leaves, flower, fruits and seeds.
Root
It is that part of plant body, which develops
from radicle and grows down into the earth.
It gives secondary and tertiary roots.
Plants have two types of root systems
1. Tap root develop from radicle, normally
found in dicot plants.
2. Adventitious root with a main tap root
that is larger and grows faster than the
branch roots.
Modification of Tap Roots
Conical This type of root is thickened
towards base but thin near the side of the
plant, e.g., Carrot.
Napiform This type of root is very broad at
the top and tapering like a tail at the bottom,
e.g., turnip, beet root etc.
Fusiform This type of root is inflated in the
middle portion, while thin towards bottom
and top, e.g., Radish.
Pneumatophores This type of root is found
in salty soil near the sea and for the
respiratory activities, it undergoes toward
negative geotropism, e.g., Rhizophora, plant
sundari etc.
Mycorrhizal These roots are known from
90% of plant species and are mutualistic
association of a fungus with plant root tissue.
Most plants require specific mycorrhizal fungi
without, which they are unable to absorb
sufficient quantities of P, Zn and Mn.
The fungus takes the place of root hairs and
may penetrate the cortex completely
(endomycorrhizae) or remain on the surface
of the root (ectomycorrhizae).
Functions of Root
● Keeps the plants static.
● Transports water and mineral salts to the
stem and ultimately to the leaves.
● Absorbs water and mineral salts from
the soil.
Stem
It is the ascending organ of the plant,
which is formed by the elongation of
plumule. Thus, stem is that part of the
plant, which originates from plumule and
goes towards sunlight opposite to the
gravity.
Underground Modifications
In the adverse conditions underground
stems store their food and become
thickened and tuberous.
Various types of modifications can be
described as
Stem tuber Potato
Bulb Onion, garlic, tulips, lilies etc.
Corm Gladiolus, Crocus sativus or
saffron etc.
Rhizome Ginger, turmeric, arrow root
etc.
Subaerial Modifications
There are various types of modifications
exists in such types of stem
Runner Grass root, Mereilia etc.
Stolon Mint, jasmine, strawberry etc.
Offset Water hyacinth, Pistia etc.
Sucker Pudira, chrysanthemum etc.
Aerial Modifications
Various aerial modifications are:
Stem tendril Grape
Stem thorn Lemon, roses, jujube plum
or Chinese date
Phylloclade Cactus
Bulbils Ruscus.
Leaf
It is a green part, its main function is to
make food through photosynthesis and
respiration. Leaves are mainly of two
types
1. Simple Leaf A leaf having one blade
but blade is not divided, e.g., mango.
2. Compound Leaf A leaf with more
than one blade. All blades are
attached to a single leaf stem, e.g.,
Rose, orange etc.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 455
Parts of a Typical Leaf
Leaf Base It is the lowermost part of the leaf, borne onto the node of the stem or its
branches.
Petiole The stalk of leaf that connects the lamina with the stem or its branch is
called petiole.
Lamina It is the terminal, flattened, green and conspicuous part of a leaf and is
specialised to manufacture food (photosynthesis).
Inflorescence
The arrangement of flowers on a floral
axis is called inflorescence. The portion of
stem that bear cluster of flowers is called
peduncle and the stalk of individual flower
is called pedicel. The inflorescence has
been classified into five distinct types
according to modes of branching and
modification of peduncle.
Solitary
Racemose
Cymose
Mixed
Specialized
Out of four, two types are most important.
Racemose Inflorescence
In racemose inflorescence, the main axis
is capable of continuous growth. The
flowers show acropetal succession on the
main axis.
Cymose Inflorescence
In cymose inflorescence, the main axis ends
in a flower, since the peduncle stops growing.
The flowers show basipetal succession.

Stem Root
Cuticle or cutinised outer walls of epidermal
cells present.
Cuticle or cutinised outer walls absent.
Epidermis is protective in function. Epidermis (young) is absorptive in function. It is
called epiblema or rhizodermis.
Stomata is present in epidermis. Stomata is absent in epiblema.
Stem hairs are additional cells, i.e., they do
not arise as outgrowths of epidermal cells.
Root hairs are tubular outgrowths of the epiblema
(epidermal) cells.
Chloroplasts may be present in some outer
cells of the cortex.
Chloroplast almost absent.
Cortex narrow. Cortex broad.
Endodermis is inconspicuous. Endodermis is conspicuous.
Pericycle not involved in secondary growth. Pericycle actively involved in root branches
formation and in secondary growth.
Xylem characteristically endarch. Xylem characteristically exarch.
Xylem and phloem fibres present. Xylem and phloem fibres usually absent.
Secondary growth, if occurs, takes place by
primary cambium, which is both
interfascicular and intrafascicular.
Secondary growth, if present, takes place by
secondary cambium, the conjunctive parenchyma
and pericycle start meristematic activity and
participate.
FLOWER
It is a modified shoot that consists of
accessary whorls (calyx and corolla) and
essential whorls (androecium and
gynoecium). The plant, which bears both
male and female flower is called
monoecious, while separate plants with
one type of flower are called dioecious.
Calyx
The outermost whorl consisting of units
called sepals; these are typically green and
enclose the rest of the flower in the bud
stage, however, they can be absent or
prominent and petal-like in some species.
Corolla
The next whorl toward the apex, composed
of units called petals, which are typically
thin, soft and coloured to attract animals
that help the process of pollination.
Androecium
The next whorl, consisting of units called
stamens. It consist of two parts–a stalk
called a filament, topped by an anther,
where pollen is produced by meiosis and
eventually dispersed.
Gynoecium
● The innermost whorl of a flower,
consisting of one or more units called
carpels. The carpel or multiple fused
carpels form a hollow structure called an
ovary, which produces ovules internally.
● Ovules are megasporangia and they in
turn produce megaspores by meiosis,
which develop into female
gametophytes. These give rise to egg
cells.
● The gynoecium of a flower is also
described using an alternative
terminology, wherein the structure one
sees in the innermost whorl (consisting
of an ovary, style and stigma) is called
a pistil.
● A pistil may consist of a single carpel or a
number of carpels fused together. The
sticky tip of the pistil, the stigma, is the
receptor of pollen. The supportive stalk,
the style, becomes the pathway for pollen
tubes to grow from pollen grains
adhering to the stigma.
Pollination
Transfer of pollens from stamens to stigma
is called pollination.
It is of two types
Self-pollination
Transfer of pollen from stamen to the
stigma of same flower or different flower of
the same plant.
Cross–pollination
In this, pollen reach from anther of one
flower to the stigma of different flower of
same species. This is done with the help of
air, water, insects or animals (agents of
pollination). In most flowers, maximum
pollination occurs by the method of
anemophily (by mind). In this mode,
pollen-loss is maximum.
Fruits
It is ripened ovary of flower. The fruit may
be true (formed from ovary alone) or false
(developed from other part of flower except
ovary). These are of three main types, i.e.,
simple, aggregate and composite.
Simple Fruit
A simple fruit always develops from a single
ovary containing one or more carpels and
may or may not include additional
modified accessory floral (perianth)
structures. In addition, a simple fruit is
either fleshy or dry. Fleshy fruits are edible
and are seen in the fresh fruit and
vegetable section of your local super
market.
Aggregate Fruits
These are groups of simple fruits, developed
from multicarpellary or polycarpellary,
apocarpous ovary of a flower. These are
etaerio of follicle, etaerio of achenes, etaerio
of berries and etaerio of drupes.
Composite Fruits
A composite or multiple fruit develops from
the complete inflorescence. These are of
two types
Sorosis A multiple fruit derived from just
the pistils of many unisexual flowers of an
inflorescence, e.g., Mulberry, jackfruit,
pineapple etc.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 457
Syconus A multiple fruit derived from
numerous ovaries borne on the inside of
the fleshy receptacle of an inflorescence.
Also in accessory fruit, the fleshy portion of
the fruit is formed by the hollow peduncle
of the (inside-out) inflorescence, e.g.,
peepal, gular.
Seeds
Seed is a fertilised mature ovule that
possesses an embryonic plant.
There are two types of seeds
Non-endospermic seeds non-albuminous
seed Endosperm is absent in this seed
and stores their food material in
cotyledons, e.g., Gram, pea.
Endospermic or albuminous seed These
possess endosperm and store their food in
it, e.g., Castor, maize, rice.
AGRICULTURE
● Agriculture is derived from Latin words
Ager and Cultura. Ager means land or
field and Cultura means cultivation.
Therefore, the term Agriculture means
cultivation of land, i.e., the science and
art of producing crops and livestock for
economic purposes.
● It was the key development in the rise of
sedentary human civilisation, whereby
farming of domesticated species created
food surpluses that nurtured the
development of civilisation.
AGRONOMY
The branch of agriculture that deals with
field crop production and soil
management. Agronomists generally work
with crops that are grown on a large scale
(e.g., small grains) and that require
relatively little management. Agronomic
experiments focus on a variety of factors
relating to crop plants, including yield,
diseases, cultivation and sensitivity to
factors such as climate and soil.
Cropping Pattern
Crop Rotation
It is the practice of growing a series of
dissimilar types of crops in the same area
in sequential seasons. It confers various
benefits to the soil.
Crop rotation also mitigates the build-up of
pathogens and pests that often occurs,
when one species is continuously cropped
and can also improve soil structure and
fertility by alternating deep-rooted and
shallow-rooted plants.
Intensive Cropping
It refers to efficient use of water, nutrients
and tillage. The interdependence of and
synergies among water, nutrients and
energy in regard to increasing crop
performance is generally preferred.
Main Crops for Rotations
One yearly Paddy and wheat
Two yearly Maize and cotton
Three yearly Tomato and lady’s finger
Four yearly Cotton and wheat
Zero Tillage
It is a way of growing crops from year to year
without disturbing the soil through tillage.
No-till is an agricultural technique, which
increases the amount of water and organic
matter (nutrients) in the soil and decreases
erosion. It increases the amount and variety
of life in and on the soil.
It has two distnctive features
● Sole Cropping It is to cultivate a pure
variety of crop.
● Monoculture Planting a sole crop in a
field regularly but harvest it single in a
year.
Companion Planting/Cropping
It is the planting of different crops in
proximity on the theory that they assist each
other in nutrient uptake, pest control,
pollination and other factors necessary in
increasing crop productivity.
Intercropping
It is the practice of growing two or more
crops in proximity. It is particularly
important not to have crops competing with
each other for physical space, nutrients,
water or sunlight.
The most common goal of intercropping is
to produce a greater yield on a given piece of
land by making use of resources that would
otherwise not be utilised by a single crop.
458 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Multiple Cropping
It is the practice of growing two or more crops
in the same space during a single growing
season.
It can take the form of double-cropping, in
which a second crop is planted after the first
has been harvested or relay cropping, in which
the second crop is started amidst the first crop
before it has been harvested.
Farming System
Mixed Farming
It is one in which crop production is combined
with the rearing of livestock. The livestock
enterprises are complementary to crop
production, so as to provide a balance and
productive system of farming.
Ranching
It is the practice of raising the grazing livestock
such as cattles, sheep or poultry. The area is
known as ranch and the practice is called
ranching. The ranching and cowboy tradition
originated in Spain. During the Reconquista in
middle ages the Spanish nobles got huge lands
on grants.
Terrace Farming
It is a piece of sloped land, which has been
landscaped in such a way that, the practice of
farming can be easily carried out.
Generally, this type of farming is done in the
mountain regions along the slope. The land is
cutout along the slope and terraces are made.
This system is more common in North-Eastern
hilly tracts of India.
Truck Farming
(Marketing Gardening)
It is a horticultural practice of growing fruits,
vegetables, etc., on commercial basis, in trucks
for direct delivery to big restaurants, hotels and
motels. This technique was evolved by the
english speaking farmers, who referred them
as truck farms in 19th century.
Organic Farming
Organic agriculture means a process of
developing a viable and sustainable
agroecosystem. It is an agricultural practice
that relies on crop rotation, green manure,
compost and biological pest control.
Organic farming uses fertilisers and
pesticides but strictly limits the use of
synthetic fertilisers, pesticides, plant
growth regulators such as hormones,
livestock antibiotics, food additives
and genetically modified organisms.
Blanching
In it, the young shoots of a plant are
covered to exclude light to prevent
photosynthesis, which would produce
chlorophyll and thus, remain pale in
colour. Blanched vegetables have a
more delicate flavour and texture than
unblanched.
SEED SCIENCE
● It is a basic and most important input
of agriculture. A good quality seed is
one, which is free from adulterants,
diseased or insect-pest infestations,
which hinder or reduce the quality of
a seed.
● The era of hybridisation of seeds
started after 1930. The hybrid seeds
are the cross breeded seeds, which
are artificially developed so as to have
the desirable characters. While
developing a hybrid seed, it goes
through the various developmental
stages.
● These are
¡ Nuclear Seed It is initial pure seed
of an improved variety available with
the breeder.
¡ Breeder’s Seed It is the seed
obtained from the progeny
(generation) of nucleus seed.
¡ Foundation Seed The breeder
seeds grown on State Government
farms and agriculture universities
under scientific observations and
check.
¡ Registered Seed The seeds grown
from nucleus, breeder’s and
foundation seeds.
¡ Certified Seed The seeds certified
before release as a new variety
having all the desirable characters.
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 459
Synthetic and Composite
Seed Varieties
● Synthetic variety: It is a variety
developed by selecting a number of inbred
lines with good General Combinig Ability
(GCA). Synthetic varieties can be
developed by using clones or inbreeds,
e.g., ICMS 7703.
● Composite variety: It is a variety that is
developed by mixing of seeds of various
outstanding inbred lines, which have
similar characteristics. So, the exact
reconstitution of composite variety is not
possible, e.g., Sona, Shakti, African tall etc.
Hybrid Seed
● It is produced by cross-pollinated plants.
In hybrid seed production, the crosses are
specific and controlled. The advantage of
growing hybrid seed compared to inbred
lines comes from heterosis.
● To produce hybrid seed, elite inbred
varieties are crossed with welldocumented and consistent phenotypes
(such as yield) and the resulting hybrid
seed is collected.
Artificial Seed
It is encapsulated plant propagule (somatic
embryo/shoot bud) in a suitable matrix,
containing substances like nutrients, growth
regulators, herbicides, insecticides,
fungicides and mycorrhizae, which will
allow and help it to grow into a complete
plantlet.
Genetically Modified Seeds
It is that they have been altered or modified,
through biotechnology to have their genetic
structure changed. This is usually
accomplished by either adding or taking
away genes of the original.
Terminator Seed
The term Terminator seeds as it applies to
the area of agriculture can be defined as a
descriptive term used by some for seeds that
have been genetically engineered to produce
a crop whose first generation produces
sterile seeds, thus preventing a second
generation from being grown from seeds
saved from the first.
Traitor Technology
In this technology, to make the induced
gene active, certain chemicals are used.
Many Multi National Corporations
(MNCs) are trying to bring this in India
and environmentalists are opposing it.
Crop Diversification
It is intended to give a wider choice in the
production of a variety of crops in a given
area so as to expand production related
activities on various crops and also to
lessen risk. Crop diversification in India is
generally viewed as a shift from
traditionally grown less remunerative
crops to more remunerative crops.
AGROFORESTRY
It is an integrated approach of using the
interactive benefits from combining trees
and shrubs with crops and/or livestock. It
combines agricultural and forestry
technologies to create more diverse,
productive, profitable, healthy and
sustainable land-use systems. A narrow
definition of agroforestry is trees on farms.
Vermicomposting
It is a method of using worms to transform
organic waste into a nutrient-rich
fertiliser. It is a healthy and clean way to
eliminate wastes going into our landfills,
which improves the environment.
Vermicomposting is inexpensive and only
takes two to three months to produce
results.
Plant Preservation
Like other organisms plants can also be
infected with the disease. All these
disease causing agents are called Pests.
Main causative agents are virus, bacteria
and fungi. As for example, wheat is
infected with rust and smut. In paddy,
generally blast is found, which is spread by
Gandhi bug. In cotton, bollworm causes
disease.
Keeping fruits and vegetables fresh for a
longer period without hampering its
physical and chemical properties, is
called fruits and vegetables preservation.
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 has
Part-3 for its revelation.
460 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
Methods of Preservation
Various methods of preservation are
Low Temperature
Microbes become inactive at low temperature. We can keep them in freezer.
Pasteurisation
It is a mild heating treatment at
temperatures up to 100°C (which is the
boiling point of water at elevations up to
300 metres above sea level). This method
causes only a slight decrease in taste and
nutritional value. Pasteurised products
therefore spoil faster than sterilised
products.
Canning
There are two primary methods of canning
A hot water bath and pressure canning
which ever method you use, be sure to use
jars with lids made specifically for that
technique. Glass canning jars, which are
reusable, come in various sizes (most are
single pints or quarts), so choose one that
best suits your canning needs.
Integrated Pest
Management (IPM)
It is an ecological approach to agricultural
pest control that integrates
pesticides/herbicides into a management
system incorporating a range of practices
for economic control of a pest. An IPM
system is designed around six basic
components
Acceptable Pest Levels
● The emphasis is on control, not
eradication. IPM programmes first work
to establish acceptable pest levels, called
action thresholds and apply controls if
those thresholds are crossed. IPM holds
that wiping out an entire pest population
is often impossible and the attempt can
be expensive and environmentally unsafe.
● These thresholds are pest and site
specific, meaning that it may be
acceptable at one site to have a weed
such as white clover, but at another site
it may not be acceptable.
● By allowing a pest population to survive
at a reasonable threshold, selection
pressure is reduced. This stops the pest
gaining resistance to chemicals produced
by the plant or applied to the crops. By
not killing all the pests there are some
un-resistant pests left that will dilute any
resistant genes that appear.
Preventive Cultural Practices
Selecting varieties best for local growing
conditions and maintaining healthy crops is
the first line of defence, together with plant
quarantine and cultural techniques such as
crop sanitation (e.g., removal of diseased
plants to prevent spread of infection).
Monitoring
Regular observation is the cornerstone of IPM.
Observation is broken into two steps, first
inspection and second, identification. Visual
inspection, insect and spore traps and other
measurement methods and monitoring tools
are used to monitor pest levels.
Since, insects are cold-blooded, their
physical development is dependent on the
temperature of their environment. Many
insects have had their development cycles
modelled in terms of degree days. Monitor
the degree days of an environment to
determine when is the optimal time for a
specific insect’s outbreak.
Responsible Pesticide Use
Synthetic pesticides are generally used as
required and often only at specific times in a
pest life cycle.
Locust Control and Research
On seeing the grave situation of locust
attack, a warning centre as, locust warning
organisation has been created, at Jodhpur.
It has locust surveillance and monitoring
through 5 circle offices and 23 outposts.
Mechanical Controls
They include simple hand-picking, erecting
insect barriers, using traps, vacuuming and
tillage to disrupt breeding.
Biological Controls
The main focus for biological control is on
promoting beneficial insects that eat target
pests. Biological insecticides, derived from
naturally occurring microorganisms
(e.g., Bt, entomopa-thogenic fungi and
entomo- pathogenic nematodes).
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 461
Animal Husbandry
The rearing of animals for specific
purposes is called domestication and
such animals are called domestic
animals. Domestication of animals
started during the hunting and gathering
phase of human civilisation.
BUFFALOES
Bubalus bubalis is its scientific name.
Generally, it is assumed that India is place
of its origin. There are two types breeds of
buffaloes
Exotic or Marshy
These are generally found in Myanmar,
Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand,
Singapore, Indonesia, China. These are
used for cart mainly. Its breeds are
Jerangi, Kuhzestani, Ongole, Sinhala,
Manofi, Suinue and Walede.
Aquatic or Indian
These are heavy or light weighted and
generally preferred to stay in water. It has
low heat-tolerancce capacity.
These are again categorised into two types
Heavy Weight Buffaloes
It includes three breeds

COWS
Scientific name of cow is Bos indicus and
Bos taurus. In India, 30 varieties of cows are
present. Rearing of cow and bull is preferred
in India. 16% of the world cow and bull are
present in India.
Varieties of Cows
Some varieties of cows are as follows
Humped Indian Breeds
These are high milk-yielding and their calves
are not used for agricultural purposes.
Following are its important breeds
Sahiwal Actually found in Mont- Gomari
in Pakistan. In India, it is found in Punjab,
Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and
Bihar. It gives around 2150 L milk in a year.
4-6% is content of fat in its milk.

spotted, milk yielding capacity is 4500 L per
year 5% fat content in its milk.
● Brown Swiss It mainly found in
Switzerland. It gives 5200 L milk in a year.
Fat content is 4%.
SHEEP
There are many breeds of sheep (Ovis
aries) in our country. Today sheeps are
raised in all parts of the world. Sheep
provides us with wool, skin and mutton.
A sheep lives for about 13 years.
Exotic Breeds of Sheep
● Merino This is the main
representative of the Merino breed in
Australia and is found in extremely
high number throughout New South
Wales, Queensland, Victoria and
Western Australia.
● South Devon The South Devon is a
longwool and meat breed which
originated in South Devon and
Cornwall in England. They are of the
English Longwool type and are similar
to Devon Longwoolled but are larger.
Both sexes are polled and are naturally
hornless.
● Lincoln It is found in England and it
is useful for wool and meat.
● Corriedale It is mainly found in New
Zealand and Australia. It is useful for
wool and meat.
● Romney Marshy The Romney
Marshy are found in England.
Romney wool has the finest fibre
diameter of all the longwool breeds.
These are mainly used for wool
production.
Shearing of Wool
It is essential to promote the health of
sheep. The removal of hairs (wool) from
the recommended periods for shearing
of wool are winter (February-March) and
rainy (August- September) season when
rich grazing ground is available.
The sheeps are washed properly before
the removal of hairs. The manufacture

There are many breeds of goat (Capra
capra) in our country. Goat provide us
milk, meat, skin and hair. The fine soft
wool called Pashmina is the underfur of
Kashmir and Tibet goats.
Noori
World’s first Pashmina goat clone,
produced in Kashmir has been named
Noori and Arabic word referring to light.
Funded by world bank, the clone project
was a jointy worked on Skaust and Nari
Karnal.

INTRODUCTION
The word computer has been derived from
the Latin word ‘COMPUTARE’, which
means to compute or to calculate.
A computer can be defined as an
electronic device used to calculate and
manipulate the data (i.e. input) and
generates an output in the form of useful
information by following a set of
procedural instructions.
British scientist Charles Babbage is
considered as the Father of Computer.
He invented the first mechanical
computer in early 19th century and
further in 1833, he conceived a automatic
analytical engine for performing
arithmetic functions.
Alan Mathison Turing is widely regarded as
the Father of Modern Computers or Father
of theortical computer science and Artificial
Intelligence (AI).

Types of Computer
Computer can be classified on three
basis
On the Basis of Functions
● Analog Computers This is a type
of computer that reads data using
measurement and some program
scale. It calculates by measuring
continuous changes in the physical
quantities. e.g. Mechanical
integrators, nomogram,
speedometer etc.
● Digital Computers This is a
computer that performs calculations
and logical operations with
quantities represented as binary
digits. e.g. Desktop, mainframe etc.
● Hybrid Computers These
computers are the combination of
both analog and digital computers. It
works by measuring quantity and
calculating logical operations. e.g.
ECG monitors, HRS-100 etc.
On the Basis of Purposes
● General Purpose Computers This
type of computers are designed in
order to work in all environments.
They are versatile computers but are
not efficient and also consume a
large amount of time in generating
the results. e.g. ENIAC, desktops
etc.
● Special Purpose Computers They
are designed to perform only a
specified task. They are not versatile
and their speed and size depends on
the task. They are efficient and
consume less time in generating
results. e.g. ATM, aircraft controllers
etc.
On the Basis of Size and
Capability
● Micro Computers It is a digital
computer used by individuals and is
also considered as an acronym for
Personal Computers (PCs). They are
small in size. They are usually used
at homes, in schools and offices etc.
e.g. Laptop, Palmtop, Notebook,
Desktop etc.
● Mini Computers This type of computers
are more powerful than micro computers,
but less powerful than mainframe
computers. They are also termed as
mid-range computers.
● It is a multiprocessing system capable of
supporting 4 to about 200 users
simultaneously. e.g. IBM mid range
computers, K-202, SDS-92 etc.
● Mainframe Computers It is a very large
computer and is used for handling major
applications in large business organisations.
They can also be used as centralised
computers with several terminal users
connected to it. They can contain large
databases and are also known as super
servers.
● They can handle huge amount of
input/output (I/O) operations at the same
time. They are very expensive. e.g. Fujitsu’s
ICL VME, Hitachi’s Z800 etc.
● Super Computers It can be defined as the
most powerful computer in terms of
performance and storage capacity. They are
highly expensive and are employed for
specialised applications such as for weather
forecasting, several scientific researches etc.
● NASA (National Aeronautics for Space
Administration) uses super computers for
launching space shuttles, controlling them
and for space exploration purpose.

Components of Computer
The computer system comprises of the
following four main components
1. Input Unit
It consists of those devices through which
user can enter the data into a computer. It
links a computer to the external
environment. It translates the data into
computers understandable form. Some input
devices are
● Keyboard is used to enter data or
information, which may be in numeric
form or alphabetical form, in a computer
system.
● Mouse is a pointing device which provides
a means to input data and commands in
graphic form by selecting through moving
an arrow called pointer.
● Trackball is another pointing device which
is an alternative to a mouse.
● Joystick is an input device that moves in all
directions and controls the movement of
the cursor.
● Scanner is an optical input device and
uses light as an input source to convert an
image into an electronic form that can be
stored on the computer.
● Touch Screen is an electronic visual
display that can detect the presence and
location of a touch within the display area.
2. Output Unit
This unit contains those devices that
provide the desired output (results) in
the human acceptable format.
Some output devices are
● Monitor is also known as Visual Display
Unit (VDU). The monitor is provided
along with the computer to view the
display result. The popular types of
monitor are
◆ LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), a special
type of liquid is sandwiched between
two plates. It is a thin, flat and light
weight screen made up of any number
of colour or monochrome pixels
arranged in front of a light source.
◆ LED (Liquid/Light Emitted Diode) is
an electronic device that emits light
when electrical current is passed
through it.
◆ TFT (Thin Film Transistor) is a LCD
with active-matrix displays, each pixel
is controlled by one to four transistors
that can make the screen faster,
brighter, more colorful than
passive-matrix and capable of being
viewed at different angles.
◆ 3-D Monitors describe an image that
provides the perception of length.
When 3-D images are made interactive
then user feel involved with the scene,
and this experience is called virtual

● Printer prints information and data
from the computer onto a paper. It can
print documents in colour as well as in
black and white.
● Plotter is a special kind of output
channel, like a printer, that produces
images on paper. They are mainly used
to produce large drawings or images.
● Speaker is an output device that
receives sound in the form of electric
current. It needs a sound card
connected to a CPU, that generates
sound.
3. CPU (Central Processing
Unit)
CPU is considered as the ‘Brain of
Computer’. It is responsible for all the
manipulations and processing of the
data provided to the computer. It is
further categorised basically into two
main components
● Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) This
unit performs both arithmetical and
logical operations. Arithmetic operations involves addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division etc and the
logical operations involves AND, OR,
NOT, NOR, NAND etc.
● Control Unit (CU) It is an important
part that instructs, maintains and
controls the flow of information but
does not store the data. It tells the
memory, ALU and I/O devices that
how they have to respond to the
program’s instructions.
4. Memory Unit
This unit stores the data and
instructions, intermediate results or the
processed data and thus, provides the
relevant information whenever required
by the other units of computer.
It consists of two types
● Primary Memory It is considered to
be the main memory of computer that
stores the data which is currently in
use by the computer.
● Types of Primary Memory:
◆ RAM (Random Access Memory) is a
volatile memory, which losses the data
when the power gets switched OFF.
There are basically two types of RAM:
Static RAM and Dynamic RAM.
◆ ROM (Read Only Memory) is a nonvolatile memory, which retains the data even
when the power gets switched OFF.
◆ Program and data that cannot be altered are
stored in ROM. There are basically three
types of ROM: Programmable ROM(PROM),
Erasable PROM(EPROM) and Electrically
EPROM(EEPROM).
● Secondary Memory The computer system
uses secondary memory to store data,
program instruction and information. It
stores the data permanently. User can
access or retrieve the data whenever
required. Types of Secondary Memory:
◆ Magnetic Tape (sequential access)
◆ Magnetic Disk (Floppy Disk, Hard Disk)
◆ Optical Disc (CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc)
◆ Solid State drive (Flash drive, SD cards)
Cache Memory
It is a type of memory used to hold the frequently
used data. It acts as a buffer between the CPU
and the main memory. It consumes less access
time as compared to main memory and thus, is
used to match up the speed of fast running
processor.
Registers
These are defined as the special memory units
used by the CPU to speed up the rate of accessing
information. There are some special type of
registers used for specific work.
e.g. Program Counter (PC) is used to hold the
address of the next instruction for execution.
Some other examples are Accumulator, Memory
Buffer Register (MBR), Instruction Register (IR) etc.
Hardware
It can be defined as the physical components
of a computer i.e. the parts that can be seen
and touched.
The four main categories of hardware are
● Input devices e.g. keyboard, mouse etc.
● Output devices e.g. printer,monitor etc.
● Storage devices e.g. hard disk, floppy disk etc.
● Processing devices e.g. CPU etc.
Software
The term software can be defined as the set of
programs and procedures that enable a
computer to perform a specific task or to
process the information. Software can be
classified into three types :
468 GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE General Science 469
System Software
It is a set of one or more programs designed
to control the operations of a computer
system including hardware components
and implementations of application
software.
Types of System Software are
● Operating System It is a system
software, consisting of an integrated set
of programs that controls computer
resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices,
etc) and provides common services for
efficient execution of various application
software.
● Language Translator It helps in
converting programming languages to
machine language. There are three kinds
of language translator
◆ Assembler It converts program written in
assembly language into machine
language.
◆ Interpreter It converts a high level
language into machine language by
converting it line by line.
◆ Complier It also converts high level
language program into machine language
at one go.
Utility Software
It is a type of system software, which is used
to support, secure and enhance the existing
programs and data in the computer system.
It is also used to debug the software errors.
e.g. antivirus software, backup software etc.
Programming Language
It is a set of keywords, symbols and a system
of rules for constructing statements, by which
human can communicate, to be executed by a
computer.
Programming languages are mainly
categorised into two parts:
Low Level Languages These languages
are designed to operate and handle the entire
hardware and instruction set architecture of a
computer system directly. It is divided into
two parts:
■ Machine language, referred to as machine
code or object code, is a collection of binary
digits or bits that the computer reads and
interprets.
■ Assembly language uses structured
commands as substitutions for numbers,
allowing humans to read the code easier.
High Level Languages These languages
are not limited by the computer, designed for
a specific task and are easier to read, write
and understand. e.g. BASIC, C, FORTRAN,
JAVA etc.
Application Software
It is a set of one or more programs
designed to carry out operations for a
specific application. It cannot run on
itself, but it is dependent on system
software to get executed. It is written in
high level language.
Application Software What Does It Do? Examples
Word Processor Virtually all personal computers are
equipped with a word-processing program,
which has the same function as a type-writer
for writing letters, reports or other
documents and printings.

NETWORKING
Computer networking relates to the
communication between a group of two or
more computers linked together. When we
communicate on a network, we share
information or data through a
communication medium. E-mailing,
instant messaging and web pages all are
dependent on communication that take
place across an underlying computer
network.
Benefits of Networking
● Data and Fill sharing
● Software sharing
● Hardware sharing
● Reliability
Network Devices
These are required to amplyfy the signal to
restore the original strength of signal and to
provide an interface to connect multiple
computers in a network. Many types of
Network Devices
● Repeater is a device that amplifies the
signals when they are transported over a
long distance so that the signal can be as
strong as the original signal.
● Hub is like a repeater with multiple ports
used to connect the network channels.
● Gateway is an interconnecting device,
which joins two different network
protocols together.
● Switch forwards a data packet to a
specific route by establishing a temporary
connection between the source and the
destination.
● Bridge reduces the amount of traffic on a
LAN by dividing it into two segments.
● Modem is a device that converts digital
signal to analog signal and vice-versa.
Types of Computer Network
● Local Area Network (LAN) In this,
computers can be connected with a
geographical area spread over 1 km to
10 km or we can say within a same
building. All the terminals are
connected to a main computer called
server.
● Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) It
is a data network designed for a town or
city. Its main purpose is to share
hardware and software resources among
the various users.
● Wide Area Network (WAN) In this,
the computers are farther apart and are
connected by radiowaves. Such a
network may spread over countries.
Communication Media
Communication media of a network refer
to the transmission media or the
connecting media used in the network.
Transmission media can be divided into
two broad categories; guided and
unguided media.
● Guided Media or Wired Technologies
It consists of a cable composed of metals
like copper, tin or silver. Basically, these
are divided into three categories
◆ Ethernet Cable or Twisted Pair A
type of cable that consists of two
independently insulated wires twisted
around one another. The use of two
wires twisted together helps to reduce
crosstalk and electromagnetic
induction.
◆ Coaxial Cable A type of wire that
consists of a center wire surrounded by
insulation and then a grounded shield of
braided wire. The shield minimizes
electrical and radio frequency
interference.

● Unguided Media or Wireless
Technologies When the computers in a
network are interconnected and data is
transmitted through waves, then they are
said to be connected through unguided
media. Some commonly used unguided
media of transmission are
◆ Radio Wave Transmission There are
two principal ways in which
electromagnetic (radio) energy travels
from a transmitting antenna to a receiving
antenna. One way is by GROUND WAVES
that are radio waves that travel near the
surface of the Earth (surface and space
waves) and the other is by SKY WAVES that
are radio waves that are reflected back to
Earth from the ionosphere.
◆ Microwave Transmission It is the
transmission of information or energy by
electromagnetic waves whose wavelengths
are conveniently measured in small
numbers of centimeter; these are called
microwaves.
◆ Satellite Communication It provides
communication links between various
points on Earth. It covers a vast range of
area. It is very useful in television
transmission.
◆ Infrared Wave Transmission It refers to
energy in the region of the electromagnetic
radiation spectrum at wavelengths longer
than those of visible light, but shorter than
those of radio.
◆ Bluetooth It is a wireless technology
standard for exchanging data over short
distances from fixed and mobile devices
and to create a Personal Area Networks

OLYMPICS
● The Olympic Games were held for the
first time by the Greeks in 776 BC on
Mount Olympus, in honour of the Greek
God, Zeus. They were stopped by a royal
order of the Roman Emperor Theodosius
in AD 394.
● These games were revived in 1894 by the
efforts of a French Baron Pierre de
Coubertin and the first modern Olympic
Games were started in Athens the capital
of Greece on 6th April, 1896. Separate
winter Olympic Games began in 1924.
Women have been participating in the
Olympics since 1912.
● The Olympic Games are organised after
every 4-years.
Founder and Governing Body
● In 1894, Baron Pierre de Coubertin
founded the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) to govern the Olympic
Movement (comprising International
Sports Federations (ISF’s), National
Olympic Committees (NOCs) and
Organising Committees for each specific
games).
● IOC chooses the host city and the games
to be contested organisation and funding
is made by the host city.
● International Sports Federation (ISF)
determines the qualification rules for
each Olympic.
● The Head office of International Olympic
Committee (IOC) is at Lausanne
(Switzerland).
Olympic Symbol
● It contains five rings or circles linked
together to represent the sporting
friendship of all people. Each ring is of a
different colour i.e., blue, yellow, black,
green and red. The rings are meant to
represent five continents viz Africa
(Black), America (Red), Asia (Yellow),
Australia (Green) and Europe (Blue).
Olympic Flag
● The Olympic Flag was created in 1913 at
the suggestion of Baron Pierre de
Coubertin. It was adopted in Paris in
June, 1914, but it was raised over an
Olympic stadium for the first time at the
Antwerp games (Belgium) in 1920.
There is also a second Olympic Flag,
which is used for the Winter games.
These flags are made of white silk and
contain five interwined rings of the
Olympic Emblem.
● From left to right the rings are Blue
(Europe), Yellow (Asia), Black (Africa),
Red (America) and Green (Australia).
Atleast one of these colours is found on
the flag of every country.
● The flag is 3 m long and 2 m wide. The
emblem placed in the center is 2.06 m
by 60 cm.
Olympic Motto
Olympic Motto ‘Citius, Altius, Fortius’ is
the Latin motto meaning ‘Faster, Higher
and Stronger’ composed by Father Didon
in 1897.
The motto was introduced in 1924 at the
Olympic Games in Paris.
Olympic Flame
The Olympic flame symbolises the
continuity between ancient and modern
games. It was at the Amsterdam Games in
1928 that for the first time an Olympic
flame was ceremonially lighted and burned
in a giant torch at the entrance of the
stadium. The modern version of the flame
was adopted in 1936 at the Berlin Games.
Olympic Medals
Olympic champions are rewarded with
