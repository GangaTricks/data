in India
Part- 3

Peninsular Drainage System
Peninsular Drainage System
• Peninsula rivers are much older than the Himalayan rivers
•
• Most of the major rivers of the peninsula such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the
Krishna and the Cauvery flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These
rivers make deltas at their mouths.
• But the west flowing rivers of Narmada and Tapi as well as those originating from
the Western Ghats and falling in the Arabian Sea form estuaries in place of deltas.
Due to Hard rocks & lack of Distributaries
Peninsular Drainage System
Examples of Falls :
The Jog on the Sharvati (289 m),
Yenna of Mahabaleshwar on Narmada (183 m),
Sivasamundram on the Cauvery(101 m),
Gokak on the Gokak (55 m),
Kapildhara (23 m) and
Dhuandar (15 m) on the Narmada
Peninsular River System
• Rivers that drain into Bay of Bengal: The Mahanadi, the Godavari, the
Krishna, the Cauvery and several smaller rivers drains south-east into the
Bay of Bengal.
• Rivers that drain into Arabian Sea: The Narmada, the Tapi, the
Mahi flowing west as well as several small streams originating from the
Western Ghats flow westwards into the Arabian Sea.
• Rivers that drain into the Ganges: Tributaries of the Ganga and the
Yamuna such as the Chambal, the Betwa, the Ken, the Son and the
Damodar flow in the north-easterly direction.

EARTH
MOVEMENTS
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Earth Movements : Geomorphic Process
• The formation and deformation of landforms on the surface of the earth are a
continuous process which is due to the continuous influence of external and
internal forces.
• The internal and external forces causing stresses and chemical action on earth
materials and bringing about changes in the configuration of the surface of the
earth are known as geomorphic processes.
• These deformations are caused by the movements generated by various factors
like
1. The heat generated by the radioactive elements in earth’s interior.
2. Movement of the crustal plates due to tectogenesis.
3. Forces generated by rotation of the earth.
4. Climatic factors like winds, precipitation, pressure belts etc.
Earth Movements
Earth Movements – Endogenetic Movements
 Endogenic Forces
• They are those internal forces which derive their strength from the earth’s interior and play a
crucial role in shaping the earth crust.
• Examples – mountain building forces, continent building forces, earthquakes, volcanism etc.
• The endogenic forces are mainly land building forces.
• The earth movements are mainly of two types: diastrophism and the sudden movements.
• The energy emanating from within the earth is the main force behind endogenic geomorphic
processes.
• This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial
heat from the origin of the earth. This energy due to geothermal gradients and heat flow
from within induces diastrophism and volcanism in the lithosphere
Diastrophism (Slow Movements)
• Diastrophism is the general term applied to slow bending, folding,
warping and fracturing.
• Diastrophic forces refer to forces generated by the movement of
the solid material of the earth’s crust. All the processes that move,
elevate or build portions of the earth’s crust come under
diastrophism.
• Diastrophism includes:
• Orogenic processes involving mountain building through severe
folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth’s crust.
• Epeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of
the earth’s crust and it is continental making process.
Diastrophism
• Earthquakes involving local relatively minor
movements.
• Plate tectonics involving horizontal movements of
crustal plates.
• Slow movements/ Diastrophism can again be classified
as vertical movements and horizontal movements
Epeirogenic/Vertical Movements
or continent forming movements
• Vertical movements are mainly associated with
the formation of continents and plateaus. They
are also called as Epeirogenic movements
• The broad central parts of continents are
called cratons and are subject to epeirogeny.
• They do not bring any changes in the
horizontal rock strata.
• These movements are originated from the
centre of the earth.
• Epeirogenic or continent forming movements
act along the radius of the earth; therefore,
they are also called radial movements. Their
direction may be towards
(subsidence) or away (uplift) from the center.
• Examples of Uplifts
are Kathiawar, Nellore, and
Thirunelveli coasts.
• Coringa near the mouth of
the Godavari,
Kaveripattinam in the Kaveri
delta .
• Subsidence : Submerged forests and
valleys as well as buildings are
evidences of subsidence.
• Example are Rann of Kachchh
• Sunderbans
• The Andamans and Nicobars have been
isolated from the Arakan coast by
submergence of the intervening land.
• Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait is very
shallow and has been submerged
• Mahabalipuram near Chennai (Madras)
is submerged in the sea
Orogenic/Horizontal Movements or the
mountain-forming movements
• Horizontal forces acts on the earth’s crust from
side to side to cause these movements.
• They are also known as orogenic movements
(mountain building).
• They bring a lot of disruptions to the horizontal
layer of strata leading to a large structural
deformation of earth’s crust.
• They can be classified as forces of compression
and forces of tension.
• Orogenic or the mountain-forming movements
act tangentially to the earth surface, as in plate
tectonics.
Forces of compression
• Forces of compression are the forces
which push rock strata against a hard
plane from one side or from both sides.
• The compressional forces lead to the
bending of rock layers and thus lead to
the formation of Fold Mountains.
• Most of the great mountain chains of the
world like the Himalayas, the Rockies (N.
America), the Andes (S. America), the Alps
(Europe) etc .
Forces of Tension
• Forces of tension work horizontally, but in opposite directions and
produces fissures
• Under the operation of intense tensional forces, the rock stratum
gets broken or fractured which results in the formation of cracks and
fractures in the crust.
• The displacement of rock upward or downward from their original
position along such a fracture is termed as faulting.
• The line along which displacement of the fractured rock strata take place
is called as the fault line.
• Faulting results in the formation of well-known relief features such
as RiftValleys and Block Mountains. (E.g. Vindhya and Satpura
Mountains)
• A rift valley is formed by sinking of rock strata lying between two almost
parallel faults. (E.g. Valley of Nile, Rift valley of Narmada and Tapti )
• Rift valleys with steep parallel walls along the fault are called
as Graben and the uplifted landmass with steep slopes on both sides are
called as Horst.
• The very steep slope in a continuous line along a fault is termed
as Escarpment.
Sudden Movements
• Earthquake
• Volcanism
• (We have already discussed it in separate
chapters )
Exogenetic Movements
• The forces which derive their strength from the earth’s exterior or
originate within the earth’s atmosphere are called as exogenic forces
or external forces.
• The action of exogenic forces results in wearing down and hence
they are considered as land wearing forces.
• Examples of forces – the wind, waves, water etc.
• Examples of exogenic processes – weathering, mass movement,
erosion, deposition.
• The actions of exogenic forces result in wearing
down (degradation) of relief/elevations and
filling up (aggradation) of basins/ depressions,
on the earth’s surface. The phenomenon of
wearing down of relief variations of the surface
of the earth through erosion is known
as gradation.
• Exogenic (Exogenetic) processes are a direct
result of stress induced in earth materials due
to various forces that come into existence due
to sun’s heat.
• Forces acting along the faces of earth materials
are shear stresses (separating forces). It is this
stress that breaks rocks and other earth
materials.
Exogenic Processes or Denudation
• Denudation means strip off or uncover.
• The elements of nature capable of doing these exogenic
processes are termed as geomorphic agents (or exogenic
geomorphic agents). E.g. the wind, water, waves etc.
• Gravity and gradients are the two things which make these
agents mobile.
• All the movements either within the earth or on the surface of
the earth occur due to gradients– from higher levels to lower
levels, from high pressure to low pressure and derive their
energy from the sun and also the gradient created by tectonic
factors.
• The gravitational force acts upon all earth materials having
sloping surface and tends to produce movement of matter in the
down-slope direction. This creates stress and induces
deformation to the particles.
Denudation
Weathering
• Weathering is the action of elements
of weather and climate over earth material.
• It can be defined mechanical disintegration and
chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions
of various elements of weather and climate.
• When rocks undergo weathering, some minerals are
removed through chemical/ physical leaching by
ground water and thereby the concentration of
remaining (valuable) minerals increase.
• There are three major groups of weathering
processes: (i) chemical; (ii) physical or mechanical;
(iii) biological weathering processes.
Chemical Weathering Processes
• Chemical weathering can be due to
solution, carbonation, hydration
or oxidation/reduction.
• This act on the rocks to
decompose, dissolve or reduce
them to a fine state.
• Water and air (oxygen and carbon
dioxide) along with heat speed up
all chemical reactions.
Chemical Weathering : Solution
• When something is dissolved in water or acids,
the water or acid with dissolved content is called
as a solution.
• This process involves removal of solids in solution
and depends upon the solubility of a mineral in
water or weak acids.
• When coming contact with water, many solids
disintegrate and mix up as a suspension in water.
• Soluble rock forming minerals like nitrates,
sulphates, potassium etc are affected by this
process.
• So, these minerals are easily leached out without
leaving any residue in rainy climates and
accumulate in dry regions.
Carbonation
• Carbonation is the reaction of
carbonate and bicarbonate with
minerals and is common process
helping to break down of feldspar
and carbonate minerals.
• Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and soil air is absorbed by water to
form carbonic acid that acts as a
weak acid.
• Calcium carbonates and magnesium
carbonates are dissolved in carbonic
acid and are removed in a solution
without leaving any residue resulting
in cave formation.
Hydration
• Hydration is the chemical addition of water.
• Minerals take up water and expand; this
expansion causes an increase in the volume
of the material itself or rock.
• The volume changes in minerals due to
hydration will also help in physical
weathering through exfoliation and granular
disintegration.
• E.g. calcium sulphate takes in water and
turns to gypsum, which is more unstable
than calcium sulphate.
Oxidation and Reduction
• In weathering, oxidation means a combination of a mineral with oxygen to
form oxides or hydroxides.
• Minerals most commonly involved in this are iron, manganese, sulphur
etc.
• The red colour of the iron upon oxidation turns to brown and yellow.
• In this process of oxidation, rock breakdown occurs due to the disturbance
caused by the addition of oxygen.
• When oxidized minerals are placed in an environment where oxygen is
absent, reduction takes place.
• Such conditions exist usually below the water table, in areas of stagnant
water and waterlogged ground.
Biological activity and weathering
• Biological weathering is removal of minerals and
ions from the weathering environment and physical
changes due to growth or movement of organisms.
• They also bring conditions for physical or chemical
weathering.
• Grazing of animals, ploughing by human beings etc
are examples of biological weathering.
• Earthworms, rodents etc., help in exposing the new
surfaces to chemical attack and assists in the
penetration of moisture and air.
• Plant roots exert a tremendous pressure on the
earth materials mechanically breaking them apart.
Physical Weathering Processes
• Physical or mechanical weathering
processes depend on some applied
forces like
I. gravitational forces
II. expansion forces due to temperature
changes;
III. water pressures controlled by wetting
and drying cycles.
Causes: Most of the physical weathering
are caused by thermal expansion and
pressure.
Unloading and Expansion
• Removal of overlying rock load because of
continued erosion causes vertical pressure
release.
• Thus, the upper layers of the remaining rock
expand to produce disintegration of rock
masses.
• Fractures will develop roughly parallel to the
ground surface.
• In areas of curved ground surfaces, arched
fractures tend to produce massive sheets
or exfoliated slabs.
• So, unloading and expansion create large,
smooth rounded domes called exfoliation
domes.
TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND EXPANSION:
• With rising in temperature, every
mineral expands and pushes against
its neighbor and as the temperature
falls, a corresponding contraction
takes place.
• Due to differential heating and the
resulting expansion and contraction
of surface layers and their
subsequent exfoliation from the
surface results in smooth rounded
surfaces in rocks called tors.
Freezing, Thawing and Frost Wedging
• Cycles of freezing and thawing (the weather becomes
warmer and causes snow and ice to melt) causes frost
weathering.
• It is most effective at high elevations in mid-latitude where
freezing and melting is often repeated.
• During the warm season, the water penetrates the pore
spaces or fractures in rocks.
• During the cold season, the water freezes into ice and its
volume expands as a result.
• This exerts tremendous pressure on rock walls to tear apart
even where the rocks are massive.
• Frost weathering occurs due to growth of ice within pores
and cracks of rocks during repeated cycles of freezing and
melting.
Salt Weathering
• Salts in rocks expand due to thermal action, hydration and
crystallization.
• High temperature ranges between 30-50 0 C of surface
temperatures favours such salt expansions.
• Salt crystallization is the most effective of all salt weathering
processes.
• It is favoured in areas of alternative wetting and drying
conditions.
• Salt crystals in near-surface pores cause splitting of
individual grains within rocks, which eventually fall off
which may result in granular disintegration or granular
foliation.
Mass Movements
• These movements transfer the mass of
rock debris down the slope under
the direct influence of gravity.
• Mass movements are very active over
weathered slopes rather than over
unweathered slopes.
• Usual geographic agents like running
water, glaciers, wind, waves etc do not
have much role to play in mass
movements, and it is the gravity, which is
the main driving force.
• Mass movements are classified into slow
movements and rapid movements.
Slow movements
• A) CREEP:
• It occurs on moderate steep, soilcovered slopes .
• Some of the electric posts in our
region which are posted in sloppy
areas deviated from their horizontal
linearity. This is an effect of creep.
• B) SOLIFLUCTION:
• It is the process of slow down
slope flowing of soil mass or finegrained rock debris saturated
or lubricated with water.
• It can be said as a type of creep
with lubricated water influences
the movement.
• It mainly occurs in permafrost
regions as the layers of ground
water are occupied in between
permanently frozen soil and rocks.
Rapid movements
• A) EARTHFLOW:
• Movement of watersaturated clayey or
silty earth materials
down low angle
terraces or hillsides is
called earthflow
• B) MUDFLOW:
• In the absence of vegetation
and cover and with heavy
rainfall, thick layers of
weathered materials get
saturated with water and
either slow or rapidly flow
down along definite channels
is called as mudflow.
• C)DEBRIS AVALANCHE:
• It is more in humid
regions with or without
vegetation.
• It occurs in narrow tracks
on sleep slopes and is
similar to snow avalanche.
• D) LANDSLIDES:
• In landslides, the materials involved are
relatively dry irrespective of the above
said rapid mass movements. Landslides
can be classified into slump, debris slide,
rock slide etc
• Slump: It is a type of landslide in which
slipping of several units of rock debris
occurs with a backward rotation with
respect to the slope over which the
movement takes place.
• Debris slide: In this type of landslide,
there is no backward rotation. The fall is
almost vertical.
• Rock slide: It is nothing but the slide of
individual rock masses.
Erosion and Deposition
• Erosion is the acquisition and
transportation of rock debris by
geomorphic agents like running
water, the wind, waves etc.
• Deposition is a consequence of
erosion.
• The erosional agents loose their
velocity and energy on gentle
slopes and materials carried by
them start to settle themselves.
Significance of weathering
• Weathering is the first step in formation of soils.
• Weathering of rocks and deposits helps in the enrichment and
concentrations of certain valuable ores of iron, manganese,
aluminium, copper etc.
• Weathering helps in soil enrichment.
• Without weathering, the concentration of the same valuable
material may not be sufficient and economically viable to exploit,
process and refine. This is what is called enrichment.

EARTH
Characteristics and
Geological Time Scale
Part - 1
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Geographical Division
• Earth: Blue planet
• Average distance from sun : 149 million km
• Perihelion : Nearest position of earth from sun. The earth
reaches its perihelion on Jan 3 every year at a distance of
about 147 million km
• Aphelion : Farthest position of earth from sun. The earth
reaches its aphelion on July 4 every year at a distance of
about 152 million km
Relation to Solar System
Shape of Earth
• Oblate spheroid or
oblate ellipsoid shape
• Slightly flattering at
poles & slightly bulging
at equator
• Polar radius approx. 21
km shorter than
equatorial radius
Axis of Earth
Earth rotating around an imaginary line running
through North pole & South pole via its center
Equator
 Center most parallel, dividing earth into two
equal hemispheres namely Northern & Southern
hemisphere
 Lying at 0* latitude
Tropic of Cancer Parallels at 23.5* north of equator
Tropic of
Capricorn Parallels at 23.5* south of equator
Arctic Circle Parallels at 66.5* north of Equator
Antarctic circle Parallels at 66.5* south of Equator
Latitudes
 Angular distance of a place, along meridian on earth’s surface as
measured from center
 Distance between them increases towards the poles
Longitudes
 Imaginary lines which joins poles & perpendicular to all parallels
 Drawn as a semicircle on the globe
 Also known as meridians

Distinct Features
• Length of latitudes decreases from equator to poles i.e. max. at equator &
0 at poles
• As earth’s axis is inclined by 23.5* to its orbital plane, therefore 23.5* is
max. latitude upto which sunrays can be perpendicular to any place
• Means all places between Tropic of cancer & Tropic of Capricorn
experience vertical rays of sun twice a year but both the tropics only once
• Tropic of cancer will get vertical sunrays at summer solstice, when
Northern hemisphere of earth is at max. inclination from sunrays
• Tropic of Capricorn will get vertical sunrays at winter solstice, when
southern hemisphere of earth is at max. inclination from sunrays
Earth Movements
2 types :
• Rotation of daily
movements
• Revolution of
annual movements
Rotation of Earth
• Earth’s rotate around its own axis from
west to east viz. anticlockwise direction
• Earth’s rotate around the sun (Elliptical
path) from west to east viz.
anticlockwise direction
• Axis of earth rotation is inclined at 23.5*
to perpendicular to the plane of elliptic
• Plane of earths equator to plane of
elliptic or earth’s axis to axis of
revolution is inclined at 23.5*
Rotation of Earth
• Velocity of earth’s rotation decreases from equator to poles
• Correlated with length of the parallels which also decreases from
equator to poles
• Weight of body is less at equator & greater at poles
• Because of greater centrifugal force at the equator (mv^2 / r) due
to greater velocity at equator
• Because of higher gravitational force at poles (GMm/r) due to lesser
radius of poles than the equator
Rotation of Earth
• The earth moves in space in two distinct ways viz.
• It rotates on its own axis from west to east once in
every 24 hours causing day & night
• Time Period : 23 hrs 56 min 4 sec
• Earths Rotation results in
a) Causation of days and nights
b) a difference of one hour between two meridians
which are 15 degree apart.
c) Change in the direction of wind and ocean
currents
Revolution of Earth
• It is earth’s motion in elliptical orbit around the sun.
• It revolves around the sun in an orbit every 365(1/4) days causing
the seasons & the year and results in one extra day every 4
th year.
• Revolution of earth results in
a) Change of seasons
b) Variation in the length of days and nights at different times of the
year.
c) Shifting of wind belts
d) Determination of latitudes
Revolution of Earth
Revolution of Earth
• Throughout the revolution of earth around the sun,
its axis remains tilted in the same direction
• Its axis continues to point to same spot in heaven
known as Polaris / polestar/ parallelism of axis
• Polestar i.e.Brightest star in the sky in north direction
or northern star
Seasons
• They are the periods into which the year can be
divided as a result of climatic conditions, largely due to
change in the duration and intensity of solar
radiations. The 4 seasons are
1. Spring in Northern Hemisphere: It occurs when on
March 21, the sun is directly overhead at equator .
2. Summer in NH: It occurs when on March 21, the sun
is directly overhead at Tropic of Cancer .
3. Autumn in Northern Hemisphere: It occurs when on
September 23, the sun is directly overhead at equator
again .
4. Winter in NH: It occurs when on Dec 22, the sun is
directly overhead at Tropic of Capricorn
Facts
• Sidereal Day: It is the time taken by the Earth to
rotate about its axis so that the distant stars
appear in the same position in the sky. Sidereal
day is of 23 hr 56 min.
• Solar day: It is the time taken for the Earth to
rotate about its axis so that the Sun appears in
the same position in the sky. Solar day is of 24
hrs.
• This difference is the reason why different
constellations are only visible at specific time of
the year.
Equinoxes
• The sun is vertically overhead at the
equator on two days of the year usually
on 21 March & 21 September
• Dates changes because a year is not
exactly of 365 days
• These two days are termed as equinox
means on these two days all parts of the
world have equal days & nights
Seasonal Changes
• In summer, sun is overhead & its sunrays fall almost vertically on
the earth, concentrating its heat on a small area;
• Temperature therefore rises & summers are always warm
• In winters, the oblique rays of sun come through atmosphere less
directly & have their heat absorbed by atmosphere & water vapour;
• Sun rays fall obliquely & spread over greater area, hence
temperature remain low.
Seasonal Changes
• In addition days are longer than nights in summer &
more heat is received over longer daylight duration;
Nights are shorter & less heat is lost.
• Hence, there is net gain in total heat received &
temperature rises in summer. Shorter days & longer
nights in winters accounts for reverse effect.
Solstices
• When sun is at the greatest distance from the
equator
• Its rays falls vertical either at tropic of Cancer
or tropic of Capricorn
Summer Solstice
• Earth’s axis leans at max 23.5* in
northern hemisphere towards the sun
• Sun’s ray fall vertical at Tropic of cancer
around 21/22 June
• This brings summer season in Northern
hemisphere
• With this duration of days starts
decreasing
• Means June 21/June 22 is longest day in
Northern hemisphere
Summer Solstice
• Daylights of 14 hrs at Tropic of Cancer; 12 hrs at Equator; 10
hrs at Tropic of Capricorn
• Between Arctic Circle & North Pole day lasts for 24 hours &
between Antarctic Circle & South Pole same duration of night
lasts.
• At North Pole day last for 6 months & at South Pole night last
for 6 month approx.
Winter Solstice
• Earth’s axis leans at max 23.5* in
southern hemisphere towards the sun
• Sun’s ray falls vertical at Tropic of
Capricorn around 21/22 Dec.
• This brings summer season in Southern
hemisphere
• With this duration of days starts
increasing in Northern hemisphere
• Means Dec 21/June 22 is shortest day in
Northern hemisphere
Winter Solstice
• Daylights of 14 hrs at Tropic of Capricorn; 12 hrs at Equator;
10 hrs at Tropic of Cancer
• Between Antarctic Circle & South Pole day lasts for 24 hours &
between Arctic Circle & North Pole same duration of night
lasts.
• At South Pole day last for 6 months & at North Pole night last
for 6 month approx.

Midnight sun
• The midnight sun phenomena,
also known as the polar day,
where the sun is fully visible day
and night.
• During this time, the sun
remains visible at local midnight.
• Midnight sun can last for days to
several months, where days and
nights are alike.
Midnight sun
• It is the phenomenon in the latitudes
66.5 degree North and South for Arctic
and Antarctic Circles where the sun does
not sink below the horizon during
summer.
• This results due to the tilt of the earth’s
axis, each hemisphere is inclined towards
the sun during summer.
• The duration of the phenomenon
increases towards the poles, where it
may be observed for 6 months of each
year.
Midnight sun
• The poles experiences about 6 months of day and 6 months of night
because of tilt of axis of the earth. Because of the tilt of the axis,
each pole is tilted away from the sun for about 6 months each.
• When the north pole is tilted towards the Sun, it continuous
experience daylight for 6 months. It is the night for the same time
period at the south pole. These conditions are reversed when the
South pole is tilted towards the sun.
• North pole experiences day from 21st March to 23rd September.
• South Pole experiences day from 23rd September to 21st March
Dawn & Twilight
• The brief period between sunrise
& full daylight is called dawn &
that between sunset & complete
darkness is termed as twilight.
• This is caused by the fact that
during the periods of dawn &
twilight earth receives diffused or
refracted light from the sun while
it is still below the horizon, but its
rays are scattered by the Earth’s
Atmosphere to create the colors
of twilight.
Dawn & Twilight
• Since the sun rises & sets in vertical path
at the equator, the period during which
refracted light is received is short.
• But in temperate latitudes, the rises &
sets in oblique path & hence the period
of refracted light is longer than that at
equator, which is much longer at poles.
• We have Twilight because Earth has
atmosphere. Some light scatters through
small particles in the atmosphere- so
there is some light in the sky even the
sun has gone down.
Latitudes
• Latitude is the angle between the equatorial
plane and the axis. Lines joining points of the
same latitude are called parallels.
• Equator {0° parallel} itself is largest parallel
and only circle of latitude which also is a great
circle.
• Equator is also used as fundamental plane of
all geographic coordinate systems.
• Geostationary satellites are over the equator
at a specific point on Earth, so their position
related to Earth is expressed in longitude
degrees only. Their latitude is always zero.
Latitudes
• There are 181 latitudes and each degree
of latitude spans around 111 kilometers
or 69 miles or 60 Nautical miles.
• But this distance varies because Earth is
not a perfect sphere.
• From Equator to 40° towards both poles
it is slightly less than 111 kilometers and
from 41° towards both poles it is slightly
more than 111 kilometers.
Longitudes
• It is the angular distance measured from the centre of the
earth.
• Longitude is the angle east or west of a reference meridian
between the two geographical poles to another meridian that
passes through an arbitrary point.
• All meridians are halves of great circles, and are not parallel to
each other. They converge only at the north and south poles.
• A line passing to the rear of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich
(near London in the UK) has been chosen as the international
zero-longitude reference line and is known as the Prime
Meridian.
Longitudes
• Places to the east are in the eastern
hemisphere, and places to the west are in the
western hemisphere. The antipodal meridian of
Greenwich serves as both 180°W and 180°E.
• There are 360 meridians and the longitude of
prime meridian is 0°. Length of all meridians is
equal.
• The distance between two meridians is farthest
at the equator and it decreases as we move
towards poles and becomes zero at poles.
HEAT ZONES OF THE EARTH
• Torrid Zone
• The mid-day sun is exactly overhead at least once a year on all
latitudes in between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of
Capricorn. It therefore, receives the maximum heat.
• Temperate Zones
• The mid-day sun never shines overhead on any latitude beyond the
Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The angle of the sun’s
rays goes on decreasing towards the poles. and the Tropic of
Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle in the Southern Hemisphere, They
have moderate temperatures
• Frigid Zones
• Areas lying between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole in the
Northern Hemisphere and the Antarctic Circle and the South Pole in
the Southern Hemisphere, are very cold. It is because here the sun
does not rise much above the horizon.
Greenwich Meridian
• Also known as Prime
Meridian or Time Meridian
• Meridian passing through
Royal observatory at
Greenwich
near London which divides
earth in eastern & western
hemisphere
 Prime Meridian passes through following
countries :-
 1- United Kingdom( Greenwich, London)
 2- France 3- Spain 4- Algeria
 5- Mali 6- Burkena Faso 7- Togo
 8- Ghana
• Apart from countries, through what other places
Prime Meridian Passes?
 1- Arctic Ocean 2- Norwegian Sea
 3- Greenland Sea 4- Mediterranean Sea
 5- Atlantic Ocean 6- Southern Ocean
 7- Antarctica
International Date Line
• Exact opposite to Greenwich
meridian at longitude of 180*
• It is International Date Line which
is drawn at 180 degree
longitude to determine the date
which is passed through the Arctic
Oceans, Bering Strait, Pacific
Ocean, Antarctica, Fiji, Tonga and
other islands.
• If we see this imaginary line, then
we found, it is not straight but zigzag line.
• But, if it is a straight line, then
it demarcates the same land mass into
two parts and then both places have
different dates on the same day. It
would be very inconvenient if one part
of a country had one date of the
week while another part would have
the different date.
International Date Line marks the place
where each day officially begins. At the
international date line, the west side of
the line has been always one day ahead
of the East side, no matter what time of
day it is when the line crossed.
Longitude & Concept of time
• Earth completes 1 rotation in 24 hours means swept 360* in 24
hours i.e. 15 * in one hour or 1* in 4 minute
• Since earth rotates west to east places located in the east gain time
while those located in the west loose time
Longitude & Concept of time
• Generally, 12:00 noon at a place is considered when sun’s
altitude is highest & exactly over the meridian at that place
• Time at all the places located at particular meridian i.e. north
& south will be same, however places located at east & west
will have different local time
Standard time of a country
• Standard time of a country is local time of a selected longitude
crossing through a place in the country of due importance i.e.
particular meridian is chosen for the whole country whose time is
known as ‘ Standard Time’.
• The world is thus divided into a number of time zones. Larger
countries like Russia, Canada, USA have east-west extension so that
they have adopt the several time zones.
• For example : Russia has 11 time zones, USA has 9 time zones and
Australia has 3 time zones.
Standard time of a country
• India, Whose longitudinal extent is
approx. 30 degree has adopted one time
zone, means longitude passing through
Allahabad situated at 82.5* East of
Prime meridian i.e. Five & half hours
ahead of GMT
• The Standard Meridian passes through 5
states :
• Uttar Pradesh Madhya Pradesh
• Chhattisgarh Odisha
• Andhra Pradesh

• Graticule
 Network of parallels & meridians
drawn on the globe
 Helps to locate a place with given
longitudes & latitudes
• Great Circles
 Imaginary circles which divides the
earth into two equal parts & whose
center lies at the center of the earth
 Largest circles that can be drawn on
the globe i.e. Equator & all meridians

Characteristics and
Geological Time Scale
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Eclipses
• Partial or total obstruction of
light from a celestial body as it
passes through shadow of
another celestial body
• Apparently, eclipse shall occur
every month because of
revolution of earth around the
sun & moon around the earth
Lunar Eclipse
• When earth comes exactly between Sun &
moon
• Usually occurs at full moon
• However it does not occur on every full
moon day because the moon is so small
and the plane of its orbit is tilted about 5
degree with respect to the plane of the
earth’s orbit.
• It is the reason why eclipses do not occur
every month.
Lunar Eclipse
• A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth
passes between the Sun and the Moon
in such a way that the Moon moves into
Earth’s shadow.
• When a partial lunar eclipse is going on,
the curved shadow of Earth is apparent
on the Moon’s face; the Moon looks
kind of like it is in a crescent phase.
Lunar Eclipse
• When a total lunar eclipse is happening, the entire Moon is in
Earth’s shadow, and the Moon looks full, but glows only faintly
red.
• The reason is as follows: Earth’s atmosphere is dense enough to
act a little bit like a lens, so it refracts a small amount of sunlight
shining through it toward the Moon.
• This small fraction of light, which is mostly red because that is
the color of light that refracts best, bounces off the Moon’s
surface and comes back to Earth.
• During totality, however, the Earth-atmosphere-refracted light is
quite visible as a soft reddish glow.
lunar eclipse
How a total lunar eclipse works
During a total lunar eclipse, though the Moon
gets shadowed by the Earth, sunlight passing
through the Earth’s atmosphere, break down
in its constituent colours and the red part gets
scattered by the atmosphere and falls on the
Moon’s surface, thereby making it take on a
reddish copper hue.
For this reason since antiquity, a totally
eclipsed Moon is called a “Blood Moon”. It has
no other special relevance other than the fact
that the colour of the Moon looks blackish-red
Blue Moon
• The Moon does not turn blue but
historically the second full Moon of
an English calendar month is
termed as a Blue Moon.
• Term "blue moon" is used when
the full moon appears twice in less
than 28 days because moon takes
approximately 27 days to orbit the
earth. Therefore, we can say that
blue moon happens on an average
every three years.
Super Moon
• The coming lunar eclipse
will be more spectacular
because during the
eclipse, the Moon will be
near its perigee and
hence it will look larger
than an average full
Moon, and is termed a
Super Moon.
Solar Eclipse
• When moon comes exactly between
earth & sun & obstructs a part or
whole of the sun then a partial or
total eclipse occur
• Usually at sunrise or sunset at new
moon when the moon is in line with
the sun,
• However due to inclination of the
moon’s orbit, a solar eclipse doesn’t
occur on every moon day.
Solar Eclipse
• Like Earth’s shadow, the Moon’s shadow consists
of two parts: a dark, central region called the
umbra, and a lighter region called the penumbra
that surrounds the umbra. Under the penumbra,
a partial solar eclipse occurs. Under the umbra, a
total eclipse or an annular eclipse is seen.
• Since the Moon travels in a slightly elliptical orbit
around Earth, rather than in a perfectly circular
path, its distance from Earth is not always the
same.
• If the Moon’s umbra falls on Earth’s surface when
the two bodies are at a closer point in the Moon’s
orbit, there is total solar eclipse.
Solar Eclipse
• But if the Moon happens to be too far away from Earth
at that time, the Moon does not cover enough of the
sky to block the Sun’s rays entirely. In that case, the Sun
is seen as a ring, or annulus, of light glowing around
the silhouette of the Moon.
• During totality of a solar eclipse, the Sun looks like a
perfectly black disk surrounded by glowing light. This
light is actually the Sun’s corona, which is invisible
under normal circumstances because the Sun is so
bright. Away from the corona, the sky is dark, so
planets and stars that ordinarily could be seen only at
night become visible.
Why Moon blocks Sun so perfectly
during solar eclipse?
• The Moon’s diameter is just under 400 times smaller than the
diameter of the Sun. Coincidentally, the Moon’s distance from
Earth is also just under 400 times smaller than the Sun’s
distance from Earth. That is why the Moon covers almost
exactly the same amount of sky, when viewed from Earth’s
surface, as the Sun. We are able to see only Corona during
Total solar eclipse.
Tides
Movement of Oceanic Water → Never Static
Vertical Movement is called Tides
Horizontal Movement is called Ocean waves & Ocean currents
Tides
• Periodic rise & fall in level of water in the oceans mainly caused by
gravitational pull of sun & moon.
• Due to the large size of sun it should attract more but because of its
greater distance from the earth, it is unable to exert much
influential gravitational force.
• Whereas, moon is much smaller than the sun but attracts more due
to its lesser distance from the earth.
• Hence, it produces a force approx. 2.17 times stronger than the sun.
Tides
• Centrifugal force caused by earth’s rotation is another major
cause of tides formation.
• Together the gravitational pull & centrifugal forces are
responsible for creating two major tidal bulges on earth.
• On side facing the moon, tidal bulge occurs due to
gravitational pull of the moon whereas on opposite side, tidal
bulge occurs due to centrifugal force of rotation of the earth.
Tides
Factors Controlling the Nature and
Magnitude of Tides
• The movement of the moon in relation to the earth.
• Changes in position of the sun and moon in relation to the
earth.
• Uneven distribution of water over the globe.
• Irregularities in the configuration of the oceans.
• On the surface of the earth, the horizontal tide generating
forces are more important than the vertical forces in
generating the tidal bulges.
Factors Controlling the Nature and
Magnitude of Tides
• The tidal bulges on wide continental shelves, have greater height. When
tidal bulges hit the mid-oceanic islands they become low.
• Continental shelves are close to the landmass and are often accompanied
with enclosed basins. This limits the cross-sectional area of water. As the
moon passes over a shelf or basin, it pulls an equivalent volume of water
from open ocean into the basin.
• Since the cross-sectional area of water in the basin is lower than the open
ocean, the tidal bulge has a larger height.
• The shape of bays and estuaries along a
coastline can also magnify the intensity
of tides.
• Funnel-shaped bays greatly change tidal
magnitudes.
• The highest tides in the world occur in
the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia,
Canada. The tidal bulge is 15 – 16 m.
• When the tide is channeled between
islands or into bays and estuaries they
are called tidal currents (tidal bore is
one such tidal current).
• There are two high tides and two low
tides every day (slightly more than a 24
hour period); then a tide must come in
within about a six hour period.
Tides based on Frequency
• Semi-diurnal tide
 The most common tidal pattern,
featuring two high tides and two low
tides each day [Actually it varies
between 3 tides to 4 tides –– 3 tides
in rare cases but 4 is normal]. The
successive high or low tides are
approximately of the same height.
Semi-diurnal tide
• Because the moon revolves around
the earth from west to east,
and each day it moves a bit to the
east if observed from the same
place on earth at the same time on
two consecutive days.
• This is why the tide interval of 12
hours and- 25 minutes between two
tides, as tides occur twice a day.
Tides based on Frequency
• Diurnal tide
 There is only one high tide and one low tide
during each day. The successive high and
low tides are approximately of the same
height.
• Mixed tide
 Tides having variations in height are known
as mixed tides. These tides generally occur
along the west coast of North America and
on many islands of the Pacific Ocean.

Tides based on the Sun, Moon and
the Earth Positions
The height of rising water (high tide) varies
appreciably depending upon the position of sun and
moon with respect to the earth. Spring
tides and neap tides come under this category.
Spring Tides
• When the sun, moon and the earth are in the straight line,
the gravitional force is at greatest because tide producing
force of both sun and moon complement each other and
they pull together.
• This produces tides of unusually range, called the spring
tides.
• On full moon & new moon, moon & sun are almost in line
with the earth
• Hence exerts combine pull on the earth
• On these 2 days tides are highest & called Spring tides.
• These occur about twice a month, at new moon when the
sun and moon are in conjugation and at the full when they
are in opposition.
Neap Tides
• Lowest magnitude as the tide producing forces of the sun
and moon act opposite to each other, as they form a
triangle.
• This happens during phases of the first and third quarter
i.e. at half moon, the sun’s tide producing force tends to
balance the tide producing force of the moon, resulting in
tides of unusually small range known as Neap tides.
• When moon is in the 1
st quarter or last quarter, sun &
moon makes right angle to each other, with earth as
center
• Hence attraction of sun & moon balances each other,
which results in low amplitude tides known as Neap tides
Neap Tides
• Normally, there is a seven day interval between the spring tides
and neap tides.
• At this time the sun and moon are at right angles to each other
and the forces of the sun and moon tend to counteract one
another.
• The Moon’s attraction, though more than twice as strong as the
sun’s, is diminished by the counteracting force of the sun’s
gravitational pull.
• Like spring tides, these tides also occur twice a month.
Magnitude of tides based on Perigee
and apogee of moon
• Once in a month, when the moon’s
orbit is closest to the earth (perigee),
unusually high and low tides occur.
During this time the tidal range is
greater than normal.
• Two weeks later, when the moon is
farthest from earth (apogee), the
moon’s gravitational force is limited
and the tidal ranges are less than their
average heights.
Magnitude of tides based on
Perihelion and Aphelion of earth
• When the earth is closest to the
sun (perihelion), around 3rd
January each year, tidal ranges are
also much greater, with unusually
high and unusually low tides.
• When the earth is farthest from the
sun (aphelion), around 4th July each
year, tidal ranges are much less than
average.
Ebb and Flood
• The time between the high
tide and low tide, when the
water level is falling, is called
the ebb.
• The time between the low
tide and high tide, when the
tide is rising, is called
the flow or flood.
Importance of Tides
Since tides are caused by the earth-moon-sun
positions which are known accurately, the tides can
be predicted well in advance. This helps the
navigators and fishermen plan their activities.
Navigation
• High tides help in navigation. They raise the water level close
to the shores. This helps the ships to arrive at the harbour
more easily.
• Tides generally help in making some of the rivers navigable for
ocean-going vessels.
Importance of Tides
• Fishing
 The high tides also help in fishing. Many more fish come
closer to the shore during the high tide. This enables
fishermen to get a plentiful catch.
• Desilting
 Tides are also helpful in desilting the sediments and in
removing polluted water from river estuaries.
 Tides are used to generate electrical power
Tidal bore
• Tides also occur in gulfs. The gulfs with wide
fronts and narrow rears experience higher
tides.
• The in and out movement of water into a
gulf through a channels called a tidal
current.
• When a tide enters the narrow and shallow
estuary of a river, the front of the tidal wave
appears to be vertical owing to the piling up
of water of the river against the tidal wave
and the friction of the river bed.
Tidal bore
• The steep-nosed tide crest looks like a
vertical wall of-water rushing upstream
and is known as a tidal bore.
• A tidal bore takes place during the flood
tide and never during the ebb tide (Tidal
bores almost never occur during neap
tides. Neap tides happen during quarter
moons, when tides are weakest).
Impact of Tidal Bore
• Tides are stable and can be predicted.
Tidal bores are less predictable and
hence can be dangerous.
• The tidal bores adversely affect the
shipping and navigation in the estuarine
zone.
• Strong tidal bores disrupt fishing zones
in estuaries and gulfs.
Impact of Tidal Bore
• Tidal bores have an adverse impact on the
ecology of the river mouth. The tidal-bore
affected estuaries are the rich feeding
zones and breeding grounds of several
forms of wildlife.
• Animals slammed by the leading edge of a
tidal wave can be buried in the silty water.
For this reason, carnivores and scavengers
are common sights behind tidal bores.

Economic Exploitation Of India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• The Britishers arrived in India in 1600s, but there real
interference in the Indian polity and economy started in 1757.
• The economic policies and its effects on the economy of India
during the British Raj can be grouped into three phases.
Introduction
1. The first phases were characterised by mercantilism which started
after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and continued till 1813.

 This phase was marked by the drain of wealth from India and direct
colonial plunder by the East India Company through monopoly in
trade and its other policies. It was the beginning of colonial
exploitation of the economy of India.
Introduction
2. The second phases were characterised by free industrial
capitalism which started in 1813 and continued till 1858.

 The period saw the deindustrialisation and ruralization of India
and the commercialisation of Indian agriculture.
 It converted the economy of India into a market for British
goods and a supplier of raw materials.
Introduction
3. The third phases were the period of financial
capitalism.
 It started from the closing years of 19th century and
continued till independence.
 This face saw finance imperialism through managing
agency forms, Export-Import firms, exchange banks
etc.
• The Battle of Plassey was fought in 1757 and Battle of Buxar
in 1764. The economic loot started from 1757 ended only in
1947 when India was free.
• Industrial Revolution in England started and this brought the
age of spinning genny, power looms and steam engine. The
most important initial developments were as follows:
Textile
• Richard Arkwright developed water frame.
• James Hargreaves developed Spinning Jenny
• Samuel Crompton developed Spinning Mule
• These were developed in the initial decades of the 18th
century. The last of above three i.e. Spinning Mule was
patented in 1769, but the patent ended in 1783. As soon as
this patent ended there was a rapid growth of cotton mills in
England.
Steam Power
• In 1775 James watt patented the improved Steam Engine
which was apart from pumping out machines; it was used in
the power machines.
• This enabled the development of the semi automated
factories.
Iron Industry
• In Iron making, Coke was finally applied to all stages of Iron smelting,
replacing the Charcoal. It improved the production as well as efficiency.
• But, the economic loot in India provided the profits to the Great Britain in
these years that no other investment had ever provided. For almost half a
century, England was standing without a competitor.
Other Industries
• Great Britain kept on maturing the manufacturing and industrial
revolution and in India; it kept changing the objectives and methods of
control towards a more centralized colony.
• The first state of economic loot from India started when East India
Company was given a status of Monopoly Company.
• So far, the company carried Indian goods such as Silk, Saltpeter, Muslin,
spices to the European markets.
Other Industries
• Till its charter was renewed for second time in 1813 and its monopoly was
ended, it kept working on the basis of the 17th century using the power of
the gun and politics.
• The cost of production had nothing to do with the prices fixed by the
company in European Markets.
• The political advancements from 1757 till 1813 gave the company squeeze
out enormous wealth from Indian Rajas, Nawabs and Nizams.
• The Charter Act of 1813 closed the British Markets for Industrial Goods
produced in India. But this act allowed one way duty free trade for the
British Mercantile Capitalists, who made India a dumping ground for
cheap and machine made imports.
Other Industries
• The Indian Industries such as silk and textiles collapsed. The new
manufacturing methods replaced the old manufacturing methods in ship
building, metal works, glass works, paper and many other crafts.
• After losing the industries, Indians were confined with the only industry–
that was agriculture.
• But the agrarian economy also produced raw materials for England’s
machines.
• Destruction of Industries rendered large scale unemployment. People
started running from the Industrial hubs to villages to become cultivators,
the pressure on land increased.
Reasons Responsible for Mercantilism
• The permanent settlement act brought by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 was
responsible for the drain of land revenue from India to Britain.
• This caused hardships and exploitation of the rural economy of India.
• The other Indian powers were unable to regulate and control the
advancements of East India company in India.
• This gave the Britishers freehand to plunder in India during this period of
mercantilism.
Reasons for Deindustrialisation and
Ruralisation of India in This Phase
• The British industrialists needed a market for their products,
so they converted India into a market for Manchester goods
and a supplier of raw materials.
• Very high import duties were levied on Indian exports to
Britain, which was necessary to make Britain the workshop of
the world .
Reasons Responsible for
Commercialization of Agriculture in India
• The demand for raw materials from the British industries such as
Lancashire cotton manufacturers etc. The colonial government supported
the commercialization of agriculture in India.
• It was necessary for the profits of British capitalists and the industrial
development of Britain.
Impacts of Finance Capitalism on India
• Higher taxation for the Indian taxpayers. The plundered wealth was
reinvested which further exploited the Indian economy.
• Around 97% of British capital Investments in India before first world war
was in the administration, plantation, transport, and finance. The main
motive was commercial penetration of India and its exploitation.
• Finance capitalism and other policies of British did not allow the rise of
modern Industries as had happened in other European countries
Development of Modern Industry in India
• Initially, the British exports to India did not allow the rise of modern
machine based industries in India. It was only in the latter half of 19th
century they began to start in India.
• The first cotton textile mill began in Bombay in 1853, which was set up by
Cowasjee Nanabhoy Daver.
• The first Jute mill was set up in Rishra (Bengal) in 1855.
• The Indian owned Industries like jute and cotton textiles were established
in the second half of 19th century, while the iron and steel, cement, sugar
etc. came in the 20th century.
Development of Modern Industry in India
• There was a lack of sufficient technical manpower in India due to the
neglect of technical education in India which retarded the healthy growth
of Indian Industries.
• The Indian owned Industries had to face unequal competition from the
foreign companies and strong opposition from the foreign capitalist
interests.
• Also, there were regional disparities in the industrial development which
hampered the nation-building process.

El Nino and La Nina
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• Monsoon is a familiar though a little known climatic phenomenon. In India, from agriculture to
economic policies to disaster management, a lot depends on the Monsoon.
• The Monsoon is a recurring event i.e. it repeats after a certain frequency of time – a year in our
case. But, it may not be uniform in every period (year). There are a lot of factors which affect
its duration and intensity over India.
• The Monsoon is basically a result of the flow of moisture laden winds because of the variation
of temperature across the Indian Ocean.
• There are a number of climatic phenomena which affect it namely the Indian ocean dipole, El
nino, La nina, Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO) etc. These phenomena affect the
temperature distribution over the oceans and thus affecting the direction and intensity of flow
of the moisture laden winds.
Origin
• El Nino and La Nina are opposite phases of what is
known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle.
• The ENSO cycle is a scientific term that describes the
fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and
atmosphere in the east-central
Equatorial Pacific. (The area between South America
and Australia near the equator )
• La Nina is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of
ENSO and El Nino as the warm phase of ENSO.
• These deviations from normal surface temperatures can
have large-scale impacts not only on ocean processes,
but also on global weather and climate, including India.
• For a normal monsoon season, the pressure distribution
is as such:
• In a normal monsoon year (without El Nino), the pressure
distribution is as follows:
• The coast of Peru in South America has a higher pressure
than the region near northern Australia and South East
Asia.
• The Indian Ocean is warmer than the adjoining oceans
and so, has relatively lower pressure. Hence, moistureladen winds move from near the western Pacific to the
Indian Ocean.
• The pressure on the landmass of India is lower than on
the Indian Ocean, and so, the moisture-laden winds move
further from the ocean to the lands.
• If this normal pressure distribution is affected for some
reason, the monsoons are affected.
El Nino
• El Nino means ‘little boy’ or ‘Christ child’ in Spanish.
• The cool surface water off the Peruvian coast goes
warm because of El Nino.
• When the water is warm, the normal trade winds get
lost or reverse their direction.
• Hence, the flow of moisture-laden winds is directed
towards the coast of Peru from the western Pacific
(the region near northern Australia and South East
Asia).
• This causes heavy rains in Peru during the El Nino
years robbing the Indian subcontinent of its normal
monsoon rains.
• The larger the temperature and pressure difference,
the larger the rainfall shortage in India.
El Nino Effects
• El Nino results in the rise of sea surface temperatures.
• It also weakens the trade winds of the affected region
• In India, Australia, it can bring about drought conditions. This affects the
crop productivity largely.
• It has been also observed certain times, that EL Nino may not bring
drought but cause heavy rainfall.
• In both the cases, it causes heavy damage.
La Nina
• La Nina means ‘little girl’ in Spanish and is also known
as El Viejo or ‘cold event’.
• Here, the water temperature in the Eastern Pacific gets
colder than normal.
• As a result of this, there is a strong high pressure over
the eastern equatorial Pacific.
• Now, there is low pressure in the Western Pacific and
off Asia.
• La Nina causes drought in Peru and Ecuador, heavy
floods in Australia, high temperatures in Western
Pacific, Indian Ocean, off the Somalian coast and good
monsoon rains in India.
• A La Nina is actually beneficial for the Indian monsoon.
• Generally, El Nino and La Nina occur every 4 – 5 years.
El Nino is more frequent than La Nina.
ENSO
• It is called El Nino Southern Oscillation.
• In normal times, when the tropical south Pacific ocean experiences high pressure,
alternatively the tropical Indian ocean experiences low pressure conditions.
• However, these pressure conditions are sometimes reversed, and results in low
pressure in the Pacific and alternatively high pressure in the Indian ocean.
• This is the periodic change in pressure conditions which is referred to as the
Southern Oscillation.
• These changes in the pressure conditions being developed in the Pacific and Indian
oceans are connected with the phenomenon of El Nino.
• This connected phenomenon is referred to as the El Nino Southern Oscillations or
the ENSO.

Declaration’.
‘’At this solemn hour in the history of India, when British and Indian
statesmen are laying the foundations of a Federal Constitution for that land,
we address this appeal to you, in the name of our common heritage, on
behalf of our thirty million Muslim brethren who live in PAKSTAN – by
which we mean the five Northern units of India,
 Viz: Punjab, North-West Frontier Province (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sind
and Baluchistan. ”

Pirpur Committee

 Was established in November 1938 by the All India Muslim League
 to prepare a detailed report regarding the atrocities of the Congress
Ministries (1937-1939) in different provinces.
 Its report charged the congress for interference with the religious rites,
suppression of Urdu and propaganda of Hindi, denial of legitimate
representation and suppression in economy of the Muslims.
Lahore Session - March 20, 1940
‘’The areas in which Muslims are numerically in majority, as in north-western
and eastern zones of India, should be grouped to constitute the Independent
States in which the Constituent units would be autonomous and sovereign”.
In this session Jinnah in his Presidential address gave the famous two nation
theory as follows:
But the term Pakistan was not used in this session.
This idea took firm shape only in 1946.
Gandhi rejected the two-nation theory and said - My whole soul rebels against the
idea that Hinduism and Islam represent two antagonistic cultures and doctrines.
To assent to such a doctrine for me is denial of God.

Electromagnetic Waves &
Electromagnetic Spectrum
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Oscillation and Waves
• Periodic Motion
 A motion which repeats itself identically after a fixed interval of time,
is called a periodic motion.
 For example - Motion of arms of a clock, orbital motion of the earth
around the sun, motion of a simple pendulum etc.
• Oscillatory Motion
 A periodic motion taking place to and fro or back and forth about a
fixed point is called oscillatory motion.
• For example
 Motion of a simple pendulum.
 Motion of a loaded spring etc.
Oscillation and Waves
• If a particle oscillates with its own natural frequency without help of any
external periodic force. The oscillation is then called damped oscillation.
• When a body oscillates with the help of an external periodic force with a
frequency different from natural frequency of the body, then oscillation is
called forced oscillation.
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
• An oscillatory motion of constant amplitude and of single frequency
under a restoring force whose magnitude is proportional to the
displacement and always acts towards mean position, is called
Simple Harmonic Motion.
Characteristics of SHM
• When a particle executing SHM passes through the mean position:
 1. No force acts on the particle.
 2. Acceleration of the particle is zero.
 3. Velocity is maximum.
 4. Kinetic energy is maximum.
 5. Potential energy is zero.
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
• When a particle executing SHM is at the extreme end, then:
 1. Acceleration of the particle is maximum.
 2. Restoring force acting on particle is maximum.
 3. Velocity of particle is zero.
 4. Kinetic energy of particle is zero.
 5. Potential energy is maximum.
Simple Pendulum
• A heavy point mass suspended from a rigid support by means of an elastic
inextensible string, is called a simple pendulum.
• Time period of a simple pendulum is given by 𝑇 = 2𝜋√𝑙/𝑔
• The time period of a simple pendulum of infinite length is 84.6 min. The
time period of a second’s pendulum is 2 s. Its length on the earth is nearly
100 cm.
• Acceleration due to gravity decreases with altitude (height) and therefore
time period of a pendulum clock will increase and clock becomes slow.
Simple Pendulum
• If the bob of a simple pendulum is suspended from a metallic wire, then
the length of the pendulum increases with increase in temperature and
therefore its time period also increases.
• A girl is swinging over a swing. If she stands up over the swing, then the
effective length of the swing decreases and therefore, the time period of
oscillations decreases.
• A pendulum clock cannot be used in a space-ship because there is no
constant gravitational force.
• Damped Harmonic Motion
• When there is friction or any other force acting within an oscillating
system, the amplitudes of the oscillation decreases over time to this
damping force. This is called damped harmonic motion.
• Resonant Oscillations
• When a body oscillates with its own natural frequency (V0) with the help
of an external periodic force also called forced harmonic motion. And if
the frequency (v) provided by the external agent is equal to the natural
frequency of the body, the oscillations of the body are called resonant
oscillations.
Waves
• Wave is a flow or transfer of energy in the form of oscillation through a
medium – space or mass.
• Sea waves or tides, sound which we hear, photon of light travelling and
even the movement of small plants blown by the wind are all examples of
different types of waves. A simple wave illustration is as follows.
Types of Waves :
• Different types of waves have different set of characteristics. Based on
orientation of particle motion and direction of energy, there are three
categories – Longitudinal, Transverse and Surface waves
Types of Waves
• Longitudinal waves – In this type of wave, the movement of the particle
are parallel to the motion of the energy i.e. the displacement of the
medium is in the same direction to which the wave is moving. Example –
Sound Waves, Pressure Waves.
• Transverse waves – When the movement of the particles are at right
angles or perpendicular to the motion of the energy, then this type of
wave is known as Transverse wave. Light is an example of a transverse
wave. Some of the other examples are – ‘Polarized’ waves &
Electromagnetic waves.
• Water waves are an example of combination of both longitudinal and
transverse motions.
Types of Waves
Types of Waves
• Surface waves – In this type, the particles travel in a circular
motion.
• These waves usually occur at interfaces. Waves in the ocean and
ripples in a cup of water are examples of such waves.
Other types of waves
• Electromagnetic Waves – Wave of electric and magnetic fields that
propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum is known an
electromagnetic wave.
• Non-mechanical waves or electromagnetic waves:
• The waves which do not require medium for their propagation i.e. which
can propagate even through the vacuum are called non mechanical wave.
• Light, heat is the examples of non-mechanical wave. In fact all the
electromagnetic waves are non-mechanical.
• All the electromagnetic wave consists of photon. The wavelength range of
electromagnetic wave is 10−14m to 104 m.
Properties of electromagnetic waves
• 1. They are neutral (uncharged).
• 2. They propagate as transverse wave.
• 3. They propagate with the velocity of light.
• 4. They contain energy and momentum.
• 5. Their concept was introduced by Maxwell.
Non-electromagnetic Waves
• Following waves are not electromagnetic
 1. Cathode rays
 2. Canal rays
 3. α rays
 4. β rays
 5. Sound wave
 6. Ultrasonic wave
Electromagnetic Waves & their discoverer
• γ-Rays - Henry Becqueral
• X-Rays - W. Rontgen
• Ultra-violet rays - Ritter
• Visible radiation - Newton
• Infra-red rays - Hershel
• Short radio waves or Hertzian Waves - Heinrich Hertz
• Long Radio Waves - Marconi
Note: Electromagnetic waves of wavelength range 𝟏𝟎−𝟑 m to 𝟏𝟎−𝟐
m are called microwaves.
Electromagnetic Radiation
• Electromagnetic waves are perpendicular waves, combining the electric
and magnetic fields.
• Electromagnetic waves are produced when an electric charge vibrates or
accelerates and can travel through empty space or through matter.
• Electromagnetic radiation consists of this type of waves.
• A mechanical wave is a wave that transfers energy through a medium. This
is a contrast to the electromagnetic wave.
• Electromagnetic waves can travel longer distances with higher speed but
due to the medium of transfer, mechanical waves are limited.
Features of Waves
• Amplitude: Amplitude is defined as the maximum displacement of the
vibrating particle on either side from the equilibrium position.
• Wavelength: Wavelength is the distance between any two nearest particle
of the medium, vibrating in the same phase. It is denoted by the Greek
letter lambda. (λ)
• In transverse wave distance between two consecutive crests or troughs
and in longitudinal wave, distance between two consecutive compressions
or rarefactions is equal to wavelength.
Features of Waves
• Time period – The time taken by the vibration of the particles of the
medium in completing one oscillation is called Time period.
• Frequency – The number of oscillations executed by the particles of the
medium in one second is called frequency of wave. Its SI unit is Hertz.
Velocity of wave = frequency × wavelength.
ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
• Gamma Rays: Highest Frequency, Shortest Wavelength
• X Rays
• Ultraviolet Rays
• Visible Light
• Infra Red
• Microwaves
• Radio waves : Lowest Frequency, Longest Wavelength
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other.
Electromagnetic Spectrum Diagram

Speed of Electromagnetic Waves
• All electromagnetic waves travel at 3 × 108 m/s in a vacuum.
• Speed of a wave formula:
• Speed = frequency × wavelength
• As the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases.
• The more is the frequency, the more is the penetrability of the rays.
• Gamma rays have the highest penetrability but it is not used in place of x
rays as the gamma rays penetrates into the bones and does not reflect
back.
GAMMA RAYS
• They have the shortest wavelength and highest frequencies in the EM
spectrum. It is generated by:
 Changes in energy levels in the nucleus
 Some radioactive substances and certain nuclear reactions produce
gamma rays.
• Because of their great penetrating ability, gamma rays can cause serious
illness. However, when used in controlled conditions, gamma rays are
useful in cancer treatment.
GAMMA RAYS
• They are the highest energy electromagnetic wave.
• They usually come from radioactive elements or stars.
• The uses include:
 Killing cancer cells.
 Making pictures of the brain.
 Inspection tools In industry.
X -RAYS
• It was discovered by William roentgen.
• It is generated by:
 a) Rapid deceleration of fast moving electrons.
 b) Changes in energy of innermost orbital electrons.
• Principle of working:
• X-Rays have high penetrability but do not penetrate through bones. These
rays get reflected by the bones when pass through it and thus provide a
reflected image of the inner structure.
X -RAYS
• X-rays are used for :
 Diagnostic tool in dentistry and medicine. Doctors and dentists can
examine the condition of a person’s bones, the root of the teeth or the
state of other inner part of the body.
 Custom officers at airports inspect the content of your luggage using
X- rays.
 Industry wise, it is used to find cracks in structures just like cracks in
bones.
X -RAYS
• X- rays have high energy and can penetrate some material.
• Uses of x-rays :
 Medicines
 Industry
 Transportation
• Too much exposure can damage living tissue or even cause cancer.
ULTRAVIOLET RAYS
• UV rays, that is at a higher frequency and energy than violet light. It is
produced by sun rays and gets filtered by ozone in stratosphere.
• UV light can kill micro-organisms.
• Too much exposure can cause: Sunburn, wrinkles, cataract and skin cancer.
• UV can be detected by:
 Photographic plates
 Photoelectric cell
 Fluorescence
ULTRAVIOLET RAYS
• Uses of Ultraviolet
 Detect counterfeit notes
 Gives the clothes a ‘glow’ effect in discotheques
 Sun- tanning
 Sterilizes medical equipment- UV rays are used in hospitals to sterilize
the surgical instruments and operating theatres as it kills bacteria and
viruses.
Visible Light
Visible Light
• It is the part of the EM spectrum which can be detected by the human
eye.
• The visible light has its own spectrum which consists of the 7 colors of
light :
• VIBGYOR (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red), generally
occurs in the range of wavelength, 400nm to 720nm.
Prism
• Dispersion of white light from the Glass Prism
• When a monochromatic light is passed through the prism, the white light
deviates from its path and dispersed into seven colors. This band of
colored component of white light is called spectrum.
• Red light has highest wavelength and least frequency while violet has least
wavelength and highest frequency.
• Red light is generally used in traffic lights as it has the least scattering
power and thus covers long distance.
Prism
INFRARED WAVES
• Heat can be transferred through infrared radiation. They are heat waves,
all objects emit infrared waves because all objects possess heat.
• Night vision goggles detect infrared waves and allow the user to see the
movement of objects in the dark.
Uses:
• For navigation through fog and haze as it is less easily scattered compared
to visible light
• Medical treatment: to warm injured muscles/ sports injuries
• Many TV remotes use infrared.
MICROWAVES
• One of their most common uses is in microwave ovens. When you switch
on a microwave oven, it gives off electromagnetic waves that bounce
around inside the oven, penetrating the food.
• Water molecules in the food absorb the energy from the microwaves,
causing the food to get hot. The motor used in microwave is called
magnetron.
• Uses of Microwave:
 Radar communication
 Analysis of the molecular and atomic structure
 Telephone communications
RADIO WAVES
• These waves are the electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths
and lowest frequencies
• Like all electromagnetic waves, radio waves can travel through a vacuum.
• However, most of the radio waves we receive have travelled through air.
Take the radio as an example. The radio converts the electromagnetic
waves into the sound that comes out of the radio speakers.
• Mainly they are used for:
 Radar communications.
 TV and radio broadcasting.

Electronics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

• Electronics : It is a branch of physics and technology
concerned with the behaviour and movement of electrons.
• Diode valve : Designed by J.A.Fleming.
• It consists of two electrodes placed inside an evacuated
glass envelope.
• One electrode is called cathode which is made up of
tungsten on which there is a thin layer of barium oxide.
• When heated, cathode emits electrons. These electrons
flow towards the other electrode called anode or plate,
which is at positive potential.
• As a result an electric current is established in the circuit.
• The electrons emitted from cathode are collected in the evaluated space around it.
• This collection of electrons is called space charge which is obviously negative.
• Diode valve acts as a rectifier.
• Rectifier is a device which converts alternating voltage (current) into direct voltage
(current).
• Triode valve : Designed by Lee de Forest,
triode valve is a modified form of usual diode.
• It consists of a usual anode-cathode pair and
one more electrode called control grid.
• Triode valve can be used as amplifier,
oscillator, transmitter and detector.
Electric Current
• An electric current is a flow of microscopic particles called electrons
flowing through wires and components.
• The Current Always Flows In Positive To Negative Terminal.
• For current to flow you must have a complete circuit contains battery, key,
wire and bulb etc.
• A Power source is needed to create a Potential Difference (form greater Pd
to lower Pd). When these conditions are met free electrons move about
inside the metal. Charges will continue to move as long as the potential
difference (voltage) is maintained. It will not flow if the potential
difference of the conductor is same.
Measuring Current
• Specifically, electric current is the rate that electric charge passes a point,
so, Current = Charge/Time or I = q/t
• If a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in time t,
then the current I, through the cross-section isI = Q/t
• Unit of Electric Current: The SI unit of electric current is Ampere. Ampere
is defined as one coulomb of charge moving past a point in one second. If
there are 6.241 x 1018 electrons flowing through our frame in one second
then the electrical current flowing through it is ‘One Ampere.’
Question
• Calculate the average current in a wire through which a charge of
15C passes in 10s ?
• Solution
 I = 15C/10s = 1.5 C/s (Ampere)
 Charge pump is needed for maintaining the charge.
Properties of Electric Current
• Electric current is an important quantity in electronic circuits. We have
adapted electricity in our lives so much that it becomes impossible to
imagine life without it. Therefore, it is important to know the properties of
electric current.
• We know that electric current is the result of the flow of electrons.
• The work done in moving the electron stream is known as electrical
energy.
• The electrical energy can be converted into other forms of energy such as
heat energy, light energy, etc.
• For example, in an iron box, electric energy is converted to heat energy.
Likewise, the electric energy in a bulb is converted into light energy.
• There are two types of electric current known as alternating current (AC)
and direct current (DC).
• The direct current can flow only in one direction, whereas the alternating
direction flows in two directions.
• Direct current is seldom used as a primary energy source in industries. It
mostly used in low voltage applications such as charging batteries, aircraft
applications, etc.
• Alternating current is used to operate appliances for both household and
industrial and commercial use.
• The electric current is measured in ampere. One ampere of current
represents one coulomb of electric charge moving past a specific point in
one second.
1 ampere = 1 coulomb / 1 second
• The conventional direction of an electric current is the direction in which a
positive charge would move.
• Henceforth, the current flowing in the external circuit is directed away
from the positive terminal and toward the negative terminal of the
battery.
Heating Effect of Electric Current
• When our clothes are crumpled, we use the iron box to make our clothes
crisp and neat. Well, you might wonder how does the iron box get hot?
• The heating effect of electric current is the answer to this. There are many
such devices that work on the heating effect.
• When an electric current flows through a conductor, heat is generated in
the conductor.
• The heating effect depends on the following factor:
 The time ‘t‘ for which the current flows : The longer the current flows
in a conductor more heat is generated.
Heating Effect of Electric Current
 The electrical resistance of the conductor : Higher the
resistance, higher the heat produced.
 The amount of current : The larger the amount of current
higher the heat produced.
 The heating effect is given by the following equation
H=I
2RT
Magnetic Effect
• When current flows through a wire, a magnetic field is developed around it.
• If a current-carrying wire is brought near to a bar of iron, it gets magnetised and
when the current flow is stopped, the iron bar loses its magnetism.
• Electromagnets produced in this way have lot of applications.
• They are used for lifting and transporting steel plates, scrap iron etc.
• They are also used in electric bells, telephone receivers, etc.
• Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. The direction
of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a north pole of the
compass needle moves inside it.
Magnetic Effect
• Therefore it is taken by convention that the
field lines emerge from North Pole and
merge at the South Pole.
• Inside the magnet, the direction of field
lines is from its south pole to its north pole.
Thus the magnetic field lines are closed
curves.
• The relative strength of the magnetic field
is shown by the degree of closeness of the
field lines.
• The field is stronger, that is, the force
acting on the pole of another magnet
placed is greater where the field lines are
crowded.
Magnetic Effect
• No two field-lines are found to cross each other.
• If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass
needle would point towards two directions, which is not possible.
• An electric current through a metallic conductor produces a magnetic field
around it.
Chemical Effect, Electrolysis
• When electric current passes through a
solution, it results in decomposition of the
solution into negative and positive ions.
• Positive ions are collected at the negative
electrode i.e. cathode and negative ions
are collected at the positive electrode i.e.
anode. This process is called electrolysis.
This process is widely used in
electroplating.
• For example, chromium plating is done on
many objects such as car parts, bath taps,
kitchen gas burners, bicycle handlebars,
wheel rims and many others.
Chemical Effect, Electrolysis
• Tin cans, used for storing food, are made by electroplating tin onto iron.
Tin is less reactive than iron. Thus, food does not come into contact with
iron and is protected from getting spoilt.
• Iron is used in bridges and automobiles to provide strength. However, iron
tends to corrode and rust. So, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron to
protect it from corrosion and formation of rust.
LEDs
• LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are available in
many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue,
white and are increasingly being used for
many applications, for example in traffic signal
lights.
• LEDs are increasingly being used for lighting.
• A cluster of white LEDs grouped together
forms a LED light source.
• LED light sources consume less electricity and
have longer lifetime than light bulbs and
fluorescent tubes.
• But LED light sources are expensive, so CFLs
are currently the best choice.
CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamp)
• However, CFLs (compact fluorescent
lamp) contain mercury which is toxic.
• Therefore, used or broken CFLs need to be
disposed off safely.
• Once the technological advances reduce
the cost of LEDs, they will become the
preferred lighting source.
Electric Motor
• In an electric motor, electric energy is converted into
mechanical energy.
• Electric motors are used in electric fans, washing
machines etc.
• In loudspeakers, energy is transferred from electric
current into mechanical energy of vibration.
• A device that reverses the direction of flow of
current through a circuit is called a commutator.
• In electric motors, the split ring acts as a
commutator. The reversal of current also reverses
the direction of force.
Electric Motor
• The commercial motors use:
 an electromagnet in place of permanent
magnet;
 large number of turns of the conducting
wire in the current carrying coil; and
 a soft iron core on which the coil is
wound.
• The soft iron core, on which the coil is
wound, plus the coils, is called an armature.
This enhances the power of the motor.
Galvanometer
• A galvanometer is an instrument
that can detect the presence of a
current in a circuit.
• The pointer remains at zero (the
centre of the scale) for zero
current flowing through it.
• It can deflect either to the left or
to the right of the zero mark
depending on the direction of
current.
Electric Generator (Dynamo)
• In a generator, the armature is rotated
in the magnetic field and an emf is
generated in it due to electromagnetic
induction.
• Thus a generator converts mechanical
energy into electrical energy.
• With a minor change in construction, a
generator can produce alternating emf
or direct emf.
• The corresponding currents produced
are called alternating Current (ac) and
direct Current (dc).
Inverter
• An inverter converts DC to AC. The
inverters for home and office purpose
are designed to convert DC from a
battery to AC, and also to charge the
battery.
• If there is a power failure, the inverter
automatically switches on the AC,
converted from the battery’s DC.
• After the mains supply is restored, the
inverter automatically switches to a
mode where it starts charging the
battery.
Electric Potential And Potential Difference
• The electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit
carrying some current is the work done to move a unit charge from one
point to the other;
• Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge
(Q)
V = W/Q
• The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after
Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist.

Electric Potential And Potential Difference
• One volt is the potential difference between two points in a current
carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1
coulomb from one point to the other.
• The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called
the voltmeter.
• The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the points between
which the potential difference is to be measured.
Type of Materials
• Conductors are those type of materials which have number of free
electrons to conduct the electricity.
• The metals are good conductors of electricity.
• Metals like silver, iron, copper and earth acts like a conductor.
• Silver is the best conductor.
• Insulators are that type of materials which do not have the free electrons
in its volume and hence, it does not conduct the electricity at all.
• Metals like wood, paper, mica, glass, ebonite are insulators.

Type of Materials
• Semiconductor is that type of
materials which do not have
free electrons at the normal
temperature, but has the free
electrons at the increased
temperature and hence,
behaves like a conductor.
• The materials such as silicon,
germanium etc., are the
semiconductor.

• Intrinsic Semiconductor : A semi conductor is an extremely pure form is known as intrinsic
semi conductor.
• Extrinsic Semiconductor : If a measured and small amount of chemical impurity is added to
intrinsic semi conductor, it is called extrinsic semiconductor or doped semi conductor. As a
result of doping, there is a large increase in its conductivity.
• Extrinsic semi conductors are of two types :
• A) N type semi conductor : An extrinsic semi conductor in which electrons are majority
charge carrier is called N type semi conductor. Such a semi conductor is made by doping a
pure semi conductor with pentavalent impurity like Arsenic, Antimony and Phosphorus.
• B) P type semi conductor : An extrinsic semi conductor in which holes are majority charge
carrier is called P type semi conductor. Such a semi conductor is made by doping a pure semi
conductor with trivalent impurity like Gallium, Indium, Boron and Aluminium.

Terms associated
• Doping : Adding of chemical impurity to a pure semi
conductor is called doping. The amount and type of impurity
is closely controlled.
• Donor : Pentavalent impurity are called donor.
• Acceptor : Trivalent impurity are called acceptor.
• The electrical conductivity of a semi conductor increases with
the increase in the temperature.

EMERGENCY
PROVISIONS
By – Dr.Vipan Goyal

• The Emergency provisions are contained in Part XVIII of the Constitution, from Articles
352 to 360.
• These provisions enable the Central government to meet any abnormal situation
effectively.
• Its aim is to safeguard the sovereignty, unity, integrity and security of the country, the
democratic political system, and the Constitution.
• During Emergency it converts the federal structure into a unitary one without a formal
amendment of the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
INTRODUCTION
©StudyIQ Education
• This kind of transformation of the political system from federal during normal times to
unitary during Emergency is a unique feature of the Indian Constitution.
• In this context, Dr B R Ambedkar observed in the Constituent Assembly that :
‘All federal systems including American are placed in a tight mould of federalism.
 No matter what the circumstances, it cannot change its form and shape.
 It can never be unitary.
On the other hand, the Constitution of India can be both unitary as well as federal
according to the requirements of time and circumstances.
In normal times, it is framed to work as a federal system.
But in times of Emergency, it is so designed as to make it work as though it was a unitary
system.’
©StudyIQ Education
The Constitution stipulates three types of emergencies:
1. Article 352 – An emergency due to war, external aggression or armed rebellion.
This is popularly known as ‘National Emergency’. However, the Constitution
employs the expression ‘proclamation of emergency’ to denote an emergency of
this type.
2. Article 356 – An Emergency due to the failure of the constitutional machinery in
the states. This is popularly known as ‘President’s Rule’. It is also known by two
other names—‘State Emergency’ or ‘Constitutional Emergency’.
 However, the Constitution does not use the word ‘emergency’ for this situation.
3. Article 360 – Financial Emergency due to a threat to the financial stability or credit
of India.
©StudyIQ Education
National Emergency
Grounds of Declaration
• Under Article 352, the President can declare a national emergency
 when the security of India or a part of it is threatened by
war
or
external aggression
or
armed rebellion*
• President can declare a national emergency even before the actual occurrence of war or
external aggression or armed rebellion, if he is satisfied that there is an imminent danger.
*Originally, the Constitution mentioned ‘internal disturbance’ as the third ground for the proclamation
of a National Emergency, but the expression was too vague and had a wider connotation
• National Emergency declared on grounds of war or external aggression it
is known as External Emergency.
• When it is declared on the grounds of armed rebellion it is known as
Internal Emergency.
©StudyIQ Education
• A proclamation of national emergency may be applicable to the entire country or only a
part of it (42nd Amendment Act).
Additions through 44th Amendment Act of 1978
• Substituted the words ‘armed rebellion’ for ‘internal disturbance’.
• The President can proclaim a national emergency only after receiving a written
recommendation from the cabinet - A safeguard to eliminate any possibility of the prime
minister alone taking a decision in this regard.
• Deleted the provision placed by 38th Amendment Act of 1975 declaring National
Emergency was immune from the judicial review.
• 2 months  1 month for parliamentary approval
• Periodic approval every 6 months
• Simple  special majority
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
• National Emergency should be approved by both the Houses of Parliament within one
month from the date of its issue.
• If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the emergency continues for
 6 months and can be extended to an indefinite period with an approval of the
Parliament for every 6 months. (44th Amendment Act of 1978)
• Every resolution approving the proclamation of emergency or its continuance must be
passed by either House of Parliament by a special majority, that is
(a)a majority of the total membership of that house, and
(b)a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that house present and
voting. (44th Amendment Act of 1978)
©StudyIQ Education
Revocation of Proclamation
• Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.
• Further, the President must revoke a proclamation if the Lok Sabha passes a
resolution disapproving its continuation.
• The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 also provided that, where one-tenth of the
total number of members of the Lok Sabha give a written notice to the Speaker
(or to the president if the House is not in session), a special sitting of the House
should be held within 14 days for the purpose of considering a resolution
disapproving the continuation of the proclamation.
©StudyIQ Education
Effects of National Emergency
1. Effect on the Centre-State Relations
• The normal fabric of the Centre-state relations undergoes a basic change which
can be examined under three forms.
a) Executive:
• The state governments are brought under the complete control of the Centre,
though they are not suspended.
©StudyIQ Education
b) Legislative:
• During a national emergency, the Parliament becomes empowered to make
laws on any subject mentioned in the State List.
• Although the legislative power of a state legislature is not suspended.
• President can issue ordinances on the state subjects also, if the Parliament is
not in session.
©StudyIQ Education
c) Financial:
• While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the President can
modify the constitutional distribution of revenues between the centre and the
states.
©StudyIQ Education
2. Effects on the Life of the Lok Sabha and the State Assembly
• While a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation, the life of the
Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal term (five years) by a law of
Parliament for one year at a time (for any length of time).
• This extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months after the
emergency has ceased to operate.
• Similarly, the Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a state legislative
assembly (five years) by one year each time (for any length of time) during a
national emergency, subject to a maximum period of six months after the
Emergency has ceased to operate.
©StudyIQ Education
3. Effect on the Fundamental Rights:
• Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of a National Emergency on the
Fundamental Rights.
• Article 358 deals with the suspension of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by
Article 19, while Article 359 deals with the suspension of other Fundamental
Rights (except those guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21).
a) Suspension Fundamental Rights under Article 19:
• The six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 are automatically suspended
• the state can make any law or can take any executive action abridging or
taking away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19.
• Any such law or executive action cannot be challenged on the ground that
they are inconsistent with the six Fundamental Rights.
©StudyIQ Education
• After Emergency ends Article 19 automatically revives
44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358
• The six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended only when
the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war or external
aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion.
©StudyIQ Education
b) Suspension of other Fundamental Rights
• Article 359 authorizes the president to suspend the right to move any court
for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency.
• Fundamental rights are not suspended, but only their enforcement and the
right to seek remedy.
©StudyIQ Education
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 359 in two
ways.
• The President cannot suspend the right to move the Court for the
enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 20 to 21.
©StudyIQ Education
Declarations Made So Far
This kind of emergency (352) has been proclaimed three times do far in 1962, 1971
and 1975
1. October 1962 – Chinese aggression in the NEFA (now Arunachal Pradesh) and was
in force till January 1968
2. December 1971 – War with Pakistan
3. June 1975 – Third Emergency was proclaimed while the second Emergency was
still in operation.
• Both the second and the third proclamations were revoked in March 1977.
• The first two proclamations (1962 and 1971) were made on the ground of external
aggression while third was made on grounds of internal disturbance.
©StudyIQ Education
The Emergency of 1975
©StudyIQ Education
Controversial because imposed by the then PM Mrs. Indira Gandhi mainly
to retain political control.
Cause - Internal disturbance – police and army instigated
Raj Narain case – 12 June 1975
Allahabad high court ruled against the PM for electoral malpractice in 1971
elections
Disqualified as member of Lok sabha and barred her from contesting again
for 6 years
26 June 1975 – 21 March 1977
President - Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed

President’s Rule
Grounds of Imposition
• Article 355 imposes a duty on the Centre to ensure that the government of every
state is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
• Centre takes over the government of a state under Article 356
 in case of failure of constitutional machinery in state.
• Popularly known as ‘President’s Rule’. It is also known as ‘State Emergency’ or
‘Constitutional Emergency’.
©StudyIQ Education
The President’s Rule can be proclaimed under Article 356 on two grounds —one
mentioned in Article 356 itself and another in Article 365.
• Article 356 empowers the President to issue a proclamation, if he is satisfied that a
situation has arisen in which the government of a state cannot be carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
 Notably, the president can act either on a report of the governor of the state or even
without the governor’s report.
• Article 365 says that whenever a state fails to comply with or to give effect to any
direction from the Centre, it will be lawful for the president to hold that a situation
has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
• A proclamation imposing President’s Rule must be approved by both the Houses
of Parliament within 2 months from the date of its issue.
• If the proclamation of President’s Rule is issued when the Lok Sabha has been
dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes within the two months
without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days
from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya
Sabha approves it in the mean time.
• If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the President’s Rule continues for
6 months.
• It can be extended for a maximum period of 3 years with the approval of the
Parliament, every six months.
©StudyIQ Education
• Every resolution approving the proclamation of President’s Rule or its continuation can
be passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is, a majority of
the members of that House present and voting.
44th Amendment Act –
Beyond 1 year, the President’s Rule can be extended by six months at a time only when the
following two conditions are fulfilled
1) A proclamation of National Emergency should be in operation in the whole of India,
or in the whole or any part of the state; and
2) The Election Commission must certify that the general elections to the legislative
assembly of the concerned state cannot be held on account of difficulties.
REVOCATION
• President’s Rule may be revoked by the President at any time by a
subsequent proclamation.
• Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.
©StudyIQ Education
Consequences of President’s Rule
The President acquires the following extraordinary powers when the President’s Rule is
imposed in a state:
1. He can take up the functions of the state government and powers vested in the
governor or any other executive authority in the state.
2. He can declare that the powers of the state legislature are to be exercised by the
Parliament.
3. He can take all other necessary steps including the suspension of the constitutional
provisions relating to any body or authority in the state.
©StudyIQ Education
• Therefore, when the President’s Rule is imposed in a state, the President
dismisses the state council of ministers headed by the chief minister.
*** The state governor, on behalf of the President, carries on the state
administration with the help of the chief secretary of the state or the advisors
appointed by the President.
• Further, the President either suspends or dissolves the state legislative assembly.
• The Parliament passes the state legislative bills and the state budget.
©StudyIQ Education
Since 1950, the President’s Rule has been imposed on more than 100
occasions,
Further, on a number of occasions, the President’s Rule has been imposed in
an arbitrary manner for political or personal reasons.
Hence, Article 356 has become one of the most controversial and most
criticised provision of the Constitution.
For the first time, the President’s Rule was imposed in Punjab in 1951.
©StudyIQ Education
Financial Emergency
Grounds of Declaration
• Article 360 - empowers the president to proclaim a Financial Emergency if he is
satisfied that a situation has arisen due to which the financial stability or credit of
India or any part of its territory is threatened.
• 44th Amendment Act – implied that the satisfaction of the President is not beyond
judicial review.
©StudyIQ Education
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
• A proclamation declaring financial emergency must be approved by both the Houses
of Parliament within two months from the date of its issue.
• When the Lok Sabha is dissolved or takes place during the two month duration
without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days
from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya
Sabha has in the meantime approved.
• Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial Emergency continues
indefinitely till it is revoked.
Thus
1. there is no maximum period prescribed for its operation; and
2. repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its continuation.
©StudyIQ Education
• A resolution approving the proclamation of financial emergency can be passed by
either House of Parliament only by a simple majority
• A proclamation of Financial Emergency may be revoked by the president at anytime
by a subsequent proclamation.
• Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.

Financial Inclusion
and Inflation
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Financial Inclusion
The process which ensures access to financial services to all
sections of the society especially vulnerable/weaker sections.
Government measures in the pre-reform era
1. Nationalization of Banks (in 1969, 14 commercial banks were nationalised)
2. Priority Sector Lending Policy
3. Lead Bank scheme
4. Service Area scheme
5. Establishment of Regional Rural Banks
6. NABARD was established in 1982
7. Cooperative Banks
8. SIDBI was established in 1989
9. SHG – bank linkage group
Measures by Government
• Latest Measures by the Government to achieve financial inclusion
1. No frills account
2. Business Correspondent Scheme (Bank Saathi Yojana) renamed as
Swabhimaan scheme
3. Post Offices Bank scheme
4. Micro Finance Institutions
5. Pension Schemes
6. Micro Insurance Schemes
7. Developmental Schemes like MNREGA
Inclusive growth Vs Financial Inclusion
• Inclusive growth is a much broader term.
• It means that the benefits of growth should percolate down to all.
• Financial Inclusion means bringing all under the Financial services cloud
which is required for inclusive growth.
• That is, in other words nobody is left behind in accessing Financial
services.
• Hence Inclusive growth includes within itself financial inclusion.
Inflation
• Inflation means increase in average prices of goods and services in a long
period of time.
• It is macro concept, where in the effect of inflation is seen over a large
basket of goods.
• Ultimate effect of inflation is that the value of money is reduced i.e., the
purchasing power of money is reduced.
Type of Inflation
• 1. Demand-Pull Inflation
 Caused due to increase in aggregate demand in the economy.
 Causes: Increase in money supply, Increase in money supply, Increase in
Forex reserves, Deficit financing by government, Increase of Exports,
Depreciation of Currency.
 Increase in foreign-exchange reserves
 Increase in government expenditure
o Due to fiscal stimulus
o Increased borrowing
 Depreciation of rupee
Type of Inflation
• 2. Cost-Push Inflation
 Caused due to reduction in aggregate supply in the economy.
 Causes: Increase in price of inputs, Hoarding and Speculation of
commodities, Defective Supply chain, Increase in indirect taxes,
Depreciation of Currency, Crude oil price fluctuation, Defective food
supply chain, Low growth of Agricultural sector, Interest rates was
increased by RBI
Remedies
• 1. Monetary Policy (Contractionary policy)
• 2. Fiscal Policy measure
 Direct and Indirect taxes (Direct taxes should be increased and indirect taxes
should be reduced).
 Public Expenditure should be decreased (should borrow less from RBI and
more from other financial institutions)
• 3. Supply Management measures
 Import commodities which are in short supply
 Decrease exports
 Govt. may put a check on hoarding and speculation
 Distribution through PDS
Constraints faced to control Inflation
• Constraints in controlling cost push inflation
 Prices of imported commodities – crude oil prices increased
 Depreciation of rupee
 Food inflation because of defective supply chain
 Low growth of agriculture sector
 Increase in interest rates
 Increase in Public Expenditure and Budgetary deficit
• Constraints in controlling demand pull
 Foreign investment is increasing
 Depreciation of rupee
Impact of Inflation
• Positive Impact
 Inflation is good for the economy upto reasonable limits. This
according to RBI is 2 to 6 percent.
 Moderate inflation stimulates growth.
• Negative Impact
 Real income of people would decrease.
 Inflation is regressive in nature.
 Would increase income inequalities.
Impact of Inflation
 Capital formation is adversely affected.
 Interest rates were increased by RBI.
 Distorts Resource allocation.
 Promotes generation of Black Money.
 Standard of living would reduce.
 Promote hoarding and speculation.
 Adversely effects BOP situation.
EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUALS
• Businessman, Borrowers
 During Inflation : They make huge profits because the price of
final product is rising at a much faster speed than the price of
raw materials.
 During Deflation : They make losses because prices of final
products fall faster than the cost of production.
EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUALS
• Fixed Income Groups, Lenders
 During Inflation : - Salaried individual, pensions suffer. Lenders suffer
because even if borrowed money is returned their ‘real Purchasing
Power would have declined.
 During Deflation : While they will benefit because the value
(=purchasing power) of money will increase.
EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUALS
• Currency itself
 During Inflation : Since rupee’s purchasing power will decline, its
exchange rate value will weaken against foreign currencies, as
foreigners get less keen to buy from India.
 During Deflation : Reverse will happen.
Phillip’s Curve
Measurement of Inflation
• Inflation is measured with the help of Index numbers. Index
numbers are numbers that measure change in any variable.
• There are two types of Index numbers
 Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
 Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
• Based in 676 commodities
• Estimated by Min of Industry and Commerce
• Measured on a monthly basis, but with a lag of 14 days.
• Base year is 2004-05
• Item Included : Primary Articles, Fuel and Power, Manufactured Items etc.
• Note: WPI was revised in 2010. It was revised on the recommendation of
Prof. Abhijit Sen committee. Earlier the base year for WPI was 1993-94.
• In India, general rate of inflation is measured by WPI.
Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
• Different methods to measure WPI
 Point to Point inflation
o Inflation is compared between two points in time, usually a
month’s inflation rate.
 52 week average method
o Average of previous 52 week’s point to point inflation is
taken.
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
• It shows the impact of inflation on a common man (increase in cost
of living).
• CPI is based on retail prices.
• Is available on a monthly basis.
• There are four types of CPI
Types of CPI
• CPI for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW)
 Base year: 2001
 Weightage of food items is 46%
 Measured by Labour Bureau
• CPI for Urban Non-Manual Employees (CPI-UNME)
 Base year: 1984-85
 This is used to provide grant by some MNC’s
Types of CPI
• CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL)
 Base year: 1986-87
 Used for the fixation of minimum wages
 This is used for revision of wages under MNREGA
• CPI for Rural Labourers (CPI-RL)
 Base year: 1986-87
New CPI introduced by CSO
• In 2011, CSO introduced three new CPI’s
 CPI – Urban
 CPI – Rural
 CPI – Combined
• The reason to introduce these new CPI’s was that there was no single CPI
that could give the effect of inflation as a common man residing in India
would experience. Base year for all the three CPI’s is 2010.
Why Inflation is high on CPI as compared to WPI?
• Weightage of food is high in CPI than when compared to WPI.

Definition of P-Notes
• Participatory Notes or P-notes are offshore derivative instruments, used by Foreign
Institutional Investors (FIIs) who are NOT registered with SEBI.
• They are used on Indian shares, but at a location outside of India.
• The above implies that FIIs who are not registered with SEBI but wish to take exposure in
the Indian securities markets can use P-notes.
• Brokers buy or sell securities on behalf of their clients on their proprietary account and
issue such notes in favour of such foreign investors.
• The P-note holder is entitled to all the dividends, capital gains and other payouts on the
underlying securities.
• The brokerages or FIIs have to compulsorily report the P-note issuance status every
quarter to SEBI.
• In doing so, the identity of the client or the final investor can be hidden.
• Overseas investors are a source of worry to SEBI as they have become an
easy route for money laundering i.e. aid in movement of black money or
unaccounted transactions.
Holding & Subsidiary Company
• Holding Company
 A company that owns majority shares in another company. E.g. Tata
Sons ltd. Holds majority shares of Tata Steel, Tata Sky etc
• Subsidiary Company
 A company that is controlled by a parent Holding Company. E.g TCS,
Tata Steel, Tata Sky are subsidiary companies of Tata Sons.

 The revolutionary terrorist movement was largely the outcome of the same
set of causes which gave rise to the extremist wing in the national politics.
 Only the revolutionaries wanted quicker results and discounted the value of
persuasion and low-grade pressure.
 The revolutionaries believed that the British rule was destructive of all that
is worthwhile in national life- political liberties, religious freedom, morality
and Indian culture.
 Methods – Western methods of Violence – Bombs and revolvers
2 phases of Revolutionary movement broadly speaking :
1. Phase 1 – 1890s- 1918
2. Phase 2 – 1920s onwards
PHASE 1
 In the early part of the 20th century, revolutionary groups sprang up mainly
in Bengal, Maharashtra, Punjab and Madras.
 The revolutionaries were not satisfied with the methods of both the
moderates and extremists.
 Hence, they started many revolutionary secret organizations.
 In Bengal Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were established.
 In Maharashtra Savarkar brothers had set up Abhinava Bharat.
 In the Madras Presidency, Bharathmatha Association was started by
Nilakanta Bramachari.
 In Punjab , Ajit Singh set up a secret society to spread revolutionary ideas
among the youth.
 In London, at India House, Shyamji Krishna Verma gathered young Indian
nationalists like Madan Lal Dhingra, Savarkar, V.V.S. Iyer and T.S.S.Rajan.
 Lala Hardayal set up the ‘Ghadar Party’ in USA to organise revolutionary
activities from outside India.
 Following were the highlights of the revolutionary activities in Maharashtra:
 Started by Chitpavan Brahmins of Poona
 Assassination of Rand and Ayerst by Chapekar Brothers
 On June 22, 1897, Damodar Chapekar and Balkrishna Chapekar- famous as
Chapekar Brothers - assassinated two British officials named Rand and
Ayerst at Poona.
 The Chapekar brothers were disillusioned with the British administration for
its indifferent attitude towards plague at Pune.
 In 1899, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his brother Ganesh
Savarkar organised a secret society Mitramela at Nashik
 In 1904, V.D. Savarkar organised the Abhinava Bharat, a secret society of
revolutionaries.
 In 1909, Anant Kanhare of Abhinava Bharat, assassinated Jackson, the
judge of Nasik, Jackson had sentenced Ganesh Savarkar to deportation to
Andaman on the charge of sedition. Ganesh’s crime was that he had
composed some patriotic songs.
 The youth of Bengal found peaceful protests and political actions getting no
results and they no longer believed that passive resistance could achieve the
nationalist aims.
 They fell back upon individual action and the cult of bomb.
 In 1902, Pramatho Mitra, Jatindranath Banerjee and Barindra kumar Ghosh
founded the Anushilan Samiti, a secret society and promoting
revolutionary activities.
 Decca Anushilan Samiti was founded by Pulin Das in East Bengal.
 Yuganter group - in Calcutta
 Apart from Decca Anushilan Samiti, there were four other prominent
samities in Mymensingh, Faridpur, Bakargunj and Burisal in East Bengal.
 In 1905, Barindra Kumar Ghosh published Bhavani Mandir.
 In 1906, Barindra Kumar Ghosh and Bhupendranath Dutta started the
paper Yuganter, in which they had inspired country's youth to begin an
armed revolution.
 On December23, 1907, the revolutionaries shot the magistrate of Dacca at
the Faridpur railway station.
 They even tried to assassinate the Lt.Governors of Bengal
 In April 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki threw a bomb at a
carriage which they believed was occupied by Kingsford, the unpopular
judge of Muzzaffarpur (now in Bihar).But the bomb killed two ladies.
 Khudiram was hanged, while Prafulla Chaki shot himself dead.
 The Ghosh brothers, along with others were arrested and tried (Alipore
Conspiracy case) for the act
 Punjab was not far behind Bengal.
 In 1904, J.M. Chaterjee set up an organisation with Lala Hardayal ,Ajit Singh
and Sufi Amba Prasad to spread revolutionary activities in Punjab. They
protested for farmers rights
 After his release from jail in 1907, Sardar Ajit Singh began establishing
revolutionary outfits in many places.
 In November 1908, the deputy superintendent of police of Lyallpur and his
orderly were assassinated. It was perhaps the first political incident of its
kind in Punjab.
 In December 1909, a bomb was exploded in the house of the deputy collector
of Ambala.
 Bombing of Lord Hardinge II and the Delhi Conspiracy Case : On
December 23, 1912 Rash Behari Bose and Sachin Sanyal threw bomb on
Viceroy Lord Hardinge II who was leading a procession in Delhi to celebrate
the occasion of the city becoming the new capital of India.
 Lord Hardinge escaped with minor injuries but his attendant died on the
spot.
13 people were arrested and tried in what is known as Delhi Conspiracy
Case. Dina Nath, one of the arrested, became government approver under
pressure. Four persons-Master Amir Chand, Awadh Bihari, Bal Mukund and
Basant Kumar Biswas were hanged.
 Rash Behari Bose succeeded in fleeing to Japan.
 Revolutionaries Activities in the
West
 The revolutionaries also established centres of activity abroad.
 In London the lead was taken by Shyamji Krishnavarma, V.D
Savarkar and Lala Har Dayal.
 In 1905, Shyamji Krishnavarma setup the India Home Rule
Society popularly known as the India House(after the house where
they lived and HQ of the society)
 He also published a monthly journal of the society, called The Indian
Sociologist.
 6 scholarships of Rs 1000 for Indians

 On July 1, 1909, Madan Lal Dhingra shot dead Mr. Curzon Wyllie, the
Assistant of the Secretary for State for India in London.
 Dhingra was sentenced to death on August 16, 1909 and India House
activities were cracked down upon by British Police.
 Savarkar was deported to India and Shyamji Krishnavarma fled and
settled in Paris
 During early 1900s, Canadian govt. had started imposing restriction on the
immigration and political rights of South Asians.
 Ghadar Party was established at San Francisco, USA in 1913 by the efforts of
Lala Hardayal, Ramchandra, Bhagwan Singh, Kartar Singh Saraba,
Barkatulla & Bhai Parmanand. Sohan singh Bhakna – first pres.
 To carry out revolutionary activities, the earlier activists had set up a
‘Swadesh Sevak Home’ at Vancouver and ‘United India House’ in Seattle.
 They started weekly journal “Ghadar”, in English and vernacular languages to
expose British exploitation of Indian economy and promote Nationalism
among masses. Thus, became famous as “Ghadar” party.
 Kartar Singh Saraba, one of the founders of the party, wrote in the first
issue:
"Today there begins 'Ghadar' in foreign lands, but in our country's
tongue, a war against the British Raj.
 What is our name? Ghadar.
 What is our work? Ghadar.
 Where will be the Revolution? In India.
The time will soon come when rifles and blood will take the place
of pens and ink."
 The importance of this event lies in the fact that it created an explosive
situation in the Punjab.
 Komagata Maru was the name of a ship which was carrying 370 passengers,
mainly Sikh and some Punjabi Muslim would-be immigrants, from
Singapore to Vancouver , Canada
 They were turned back by Canadian authorities after two months of
privation & uncertainty.
 It was generally believed that the Canadian authorities were influenced by
British Government.

 The ship finally anchored at Calcutta in September 1914 but the inmates
refused to board the Punjab-bound train.
 In the ensuing confrontation with police near Calcutta, 22 persons died.
 Inflamed by this and with the outbreak of the War, the Ghadar leaders
decided to launch violent attack on British rule in India.
 They urged fighters to go to India.
 Bengal revolutionaries were contacted; Political dacoities were committed to
raise funds mainly in Punjab.
 Thus, an explosive situation was created in Punjab
Repressive legislation :
 Prevention of seditious meetings act 1907
 Explosive substances act 1908
 Criminal law amendment act 1908
 Newspaper (incitement to offences) act 1908
 Press act 1910
 Defence of India Act 1915**
Decline in revolutionary activity after 1918 due to
 Tough laws, crackdown by police, talk of self rule/responsible govt,
 Arrival of Gandhiji and non violent methods

Foreign Invaders
and Kushans
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Contact With Outside World
• The most important political developments of
the Post-Maurya period was the onslaught of
foreigners from the north-west.
• The first among them were the Bactrian
Greeks, known in earlier Indian literature as
Yavanas; the word was derived from the Old
Persian from Yauna, signifying Greeks.
Indo-Greeks
• Central Asian Contact:
• The first to invade India were the
Greeks or Bactrian Greeks who
were called the Indo-Greeks or
Bactrian Greeks in the early
second century B.C.
• The history of the Indo-Greeks has
been reconstructed mainly on the
evidence of their coins bearing
legends in Greek and later in
Brahmi as well.
Indo-Greeks
• Demetrius,king of Bactria was
perhaps the first foreign (Indo-Greek)
king after Alexander who carried
Greek arms into the interior of India.
• He reduced to submission a
considerable portion of Afghanistan,
the Punjab and Sind.
• From Taxila he sent his 2
commanders, Appolodotus &
Menander for further conquest
• Appolodotus conquered Sindh &
marched upto Ujjain
Indo-Greeks
• The best remembered of the IndoGreek kings was Menander, (165-145 D
C.) who, as Milinda, attained fame in
the Buddhist text Milindapanho or the
question of Milinda-a catechismal
discussion in Buddhism supposedly
conducted by Menander and the
Buddhist philosopher Nagasena,
resulting in Menander’s conversion to
Buddhism.
• Menander stabilised Indo-Greek
power, in addition to extending its
frontiers in India.
Indo-Greeks
• He had his capital at Sakala (modern Sialkot) in
Punjab. There is little doubt that the attempted
to conquer territory in the Ganges valley, but
he failed to retain it.
• He may well have attacked the Sungas in the
Yamuna region, if not Pataliputra itself.
• A Brahmi inscription engraved on a Garuda
Pillar/ Heliodorus pilar found are Besnager near
Vidisa (MP) records that Antialcidas of Taxila
sent an ambassador, named Heliodorus, to the
court of Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, identified with
the last but one Sunga, Bhagavata.
Indo-Greeks
• Helidorus in this inscription professes to be a follower of Vasudeva,
associated with the God Vishnu.
• A Greek ambassador, Heliodorus, became vaishnavite (Vasudev worshiper
mainly) & erected ‘Garuda Pillar’ at Besnagar (Vidisa) – MP
• Hemaeus was the last Indo- Greek ruler who has to maintain his
precarious hold against the advancing menace of the Sakas, Parthians and
the Yuechis.
Importance of the Indo-Greek rule
• The Indo-Greeks were the first to issue coins which can be definitely attributed to the kings.
• They were the first to issue gold coins in India which increased in number under the Kushans.
1. The Greeks also introduced the practice of military governorship called strategos for
maintaining the power of the new rulers over the conquered people.
2. The Greek rule introduced features of Hellenistic art in the North-west frontier of India. The
Gandhara art was largely Hellenistic in the beginning, but as time passed the style became
more and more Indian and less and less Greek. The idea of representing the Buddha as a
human being (idol worship) originated with the Greeks.
3. The Greeks contributed to the development of the Indian theatre by the use of curtains
(known as Yavanika, Sutradhara (stage manager), Nepathya (back stage, etc.)
4. Indian astrology came to be influenced by Greek ideas, and from the Greek term horoscope
was derived the term horasastra used for astrology in Sanskrit
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• The decline of the Greek kingdoms in the
north-west coincided with an attack on
Bactria itself by nomadic tribes from
central Asia.
• These tribes included the Scythians, who
were primarily responsible for destroying
Bactrian power.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• The pressure of the consolidated Chinese empire
under Shi Huang Ti, who built the Great Wall, as
well as the drying up of their pastures drove
central Asian nomadic tribes including the Yuechis
westward.
• Pressed from the north and east, the Scythians
attacked Bactria and occupied it.
• Close on their heels were the Yuechis. Therefore
the Scythians, known in the Indian sources as
Shakas, moved from Bactria and invaded Iran and
then the Greek kingdoms in India.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• By the middle of the first century B.C. only a few Greek chiefs ruled
in India, and the Shaka power extended as far interior into the
country as Mathura.
• There were five branches of the Shakas with their seats of power in
different parts of India and Afghanistan.
• One branch settled in Afghanistan.
• The second branch settled in Punjab with Taxila as its capital.
• The third branch settled in Mathura.
• The fourth branch established its hold over western India
• The fifth branch of the Shakas established its power in the upper
Deccan.
• The first Shaka king in India was Maues or Moga (C. 80 B.C.), who
established Shaka power in Gandhara.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Maues issued a large number of coins mostly in copper, and a few in silver.
• Maues adopted the title Maharaja Mahatma, the great king of kings, an
exact Prakrit translation of the title Basileos Megalou adopted by several
Indo-Greek kings.
• His rule extended on both sides of the Indus, from Pushkalavati on the on
the west to Taxila on the east.
• Numismatic evidence suggests that Maues was succeeded by Azes I who
was followed by Azilises and Azes II.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Azilises introduced coins with a typical Indian diety, Abhishekha –
Lakhshmi.
• After Azes II the Saka territory passed into the hands of Gondophernes, a
Parthian.
• Most famous Shaka ruler in India was Rudradaman 1 who ruled not only
Sindh but also considerable part of Gujrat, Konkan, Malwa & Kathiawar.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Rudradaman 1 is famous in history for his repair work of Sudarshana lake
at Kathiawar ( 1
st ever Sanskrit inscription)
• Rudradaman I was succeeded by seven weak rulers.
• The last known ruler Rudrasimha III, who ruled upto A.D. 388, has been
mentioned in Banabhatt’s Harshacharita as having been killed by the
Gupta monarch, Chandragupta II.
• The Guptas then annexed the Saka territories.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Around 57 B.C, we hear of a king of Ujjain who fought effectively against
Shakas & emerged victorious, He called himself ‘Vikramaditya’, by whose
name an era Vikram Samvat is reckoned. Henceforth, vikramaditya
became a coveted title & whosoever achieved anything great adopted this
title.
The Parthians
• Parthians (Iranians) overthrew Shakas from Taxila around
1
st century
• The Shaka domination in the north-western India was followed
by that of the Parthians, and in many ancient Indian Sanskrit
texts the two peoples are together mentioned as ShakaPahlavas.
• In fact they ruled over this country on parallel lines for some
time. Originally the Pathians lived in Iran from where they
moved to India. In comparison with the Greeks and the Shakas,
they occupied only a small portion of north-western India in the
first century.
• Most famous Parthian king was Gondopherens, in whose reign
St. Thomas is said to have visited India for propagation of
Christianity.
Kushanas
• Branch of Yeuchis or Tocharians tribe from north central Asia
basically from neighbourhood of China
• They 1
st occupied Bactria or North Afghanistan, displacing
Shakas & then gradually moved upto Kabul valley & seized
Gandhara by crossing Hindukush range, replacing rule of Greeks
& Parthians from these areas.
• Finally they setup their authority over lower Indus basin &
Greater part of Ganga basin
• Founder of Kushana dynasty was Kadphises 1 who issued coins
in Kabul valley in his name.
Kushanas
• His son Kadphises 2 issued gold coins with high
sounding titles like “ Lord of whole world “ &
spread his kingdom to the east as far as Mathura
• The Kushanas belongs to Yuechi tribe.
• The dynasty was founded by a house of chiefs
who were called Kadphises and who ruled for 28
years from about A.D. 50. and was succeeded by
his son, Vima Kadphises who invaded India and
advanced far into the interior of North India.
Dynasty of Kadphises
• There are good reasons to believe that the Kushana Empire
extended from the Oxus River or even beyond to the
eastern border of Uttar Pradesh.
• Vima Kadphises, however, did not rule over the conquered
territories in person. He appointed a number of Satraps to
govern the different parts of his Indian dominion.
• Vima issued gold coins which show a considerable Indian
influence.
• All his coins, shows unmistakable signs of his Saiva
affiliation.
• The abundance of gold and copper coins issued by Vima
Kadphises indicated the prosperity of the Kushana Empire.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• The house of Kadphises was succeeded by that of
Kanishka.
• Kanishka started an era in 78 A.D. which is now known as
the Saka era and is used by the Government of India.
• Under Kanishka, the Kushana Empire reached the height of
its power and became a mighty force in the world of its
clay.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• In India his suzerainty extended as far south as
Sanchi and as Far East as Banaras.
• In Central Asia his dominions were extensive.
Purushapura (Peshawar) was his capital and
Mathura was the second most important city of the
empire.
• Kanishka is often remembered for his association
with Buddhism. Himself a Buddhist convert, he
convened the fourth Buddhist Council in Kashmir
where the doctrines of the Mahayana form of
Buddhism were finalized.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• He encouraged missionary activities and Buddhist
missions were sent to central Asia and China.
• Kanishka was a great patron of arts and letters. The
age of Kanishka witnessed the execution of the best
work in Gandhara style.
• He is said to have constructed at Peshawar a
multistoreyed relic tower enshrining the relic of the
Buddha under the supervision of a Greek engineer
Agesilaos.
• The Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang, who came to India
in the seventh century, gives a detailed account of
the stupa.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• Kanishka built a tower near Taxila and the city of Kanishkapura in Kashmir probably
owed its foundation to him.
• Several Buddhist theologians are associated with Kanishka – Ashvaghosha,
Vasumitra, Parshva, Sangaraksha, Dharmatrata and Matricheta. Nagarjuna was the
great exponent of Mahayana doctrine.
• He also patronised famous physician of Indian history Charka who wrote “
Charaksamhita” or sasruta
Dynasty of Kanishka
• Last important Kushana ruler was Vasudeva who was worshipper of Shiva.
• He extended Kushana empire upto lower Indus basin (Malwa) & eastward
till Magadha in India & setup his capital at Peshawar (Purushaputra)
• Kanishka issued a high number of gold coins with high purity & embraced
Buddhism whole heartedly.
• Kanishka is traditionally believed to have died fighting in central Asia.
Successors of Kanishka I
• Kanishka’s rule lasted for twenty-three years. His immediate successor was
Vasishka, who had a short reign and was succeeded by Huvishka.
• The empire of Huvishka was not less extensive than that of Kanishka. It
may have spread further to the west, as a record of his reign has been
unearthed at Wardak to the west of Kabul.
Successors of Kanishka I
• Mathura was now a great centre of Kushana power and it was adorned
with monuments by Huvishka ruled simultaneously with Vasishka II or
Vajheska and with the latter’s son Kanishka II.
• Kanishka II received in addition to the titles of great king, the king of kings,
son of heaven (devaputra)assumed by his predecessors.
• Huvishka’s abundant coinage, which is more variable than that of
Kanishka, presents fine portraits of the king.
Successors of Kanishka I
• The varied reverse devices of his coins, like Kanishka’s coins, contains the figures of
different deities such as Skandakumara, Visakha, Mahasena and Uma, the
Alexandrian Serapis, the Greek Heracles and several Zoroastrian deities.
• The absence of the Buddha on his coins leads to the inference that Huvishka was
well-disposed towards Brahmanism.
• The last great Kushana king was Vasudeva I, who ruled from about the year 67 to
98 of the Kanishka era. Most of his inscriptions have been found at or near
Mathura, and his coins usually bear the god Siva and rarely any Iranian deity.
• The decline of the Kushana power in the northwest was hastened by the rise of the Sassanian
dynasty of Persia in the third century A.D.
• One of the causes of the downfall of the Kushanas
was the rise of independent republics like the
Yaudheyas, Kunindas and Malavas in the beginning
of the third century A.D. who partitioned among
themselves territories formerly held by the
Kushanas.
• The rule of the Kushanas in parts of the Yamuna
valley seems to have been supplanted by that of
the Nagas.
Growth of Urban Centers
• During this period, there is seen a growth of urban centres because this
phase registered a distinct advance in building activities.
• We find the use of burnt bricks for flooring and roofing, construction of
brick kilns, use of script files, and use of red pottery.
Economy and Coinage
• This age of foreign rule had the best impact on
Indian trade and commerce. Unlike other ages of
foreign rule, Sakas and Kushans introduced better
cavalry, use of reins, toe stirrups, turban, tunic,
trousers and heavy long coat. India received a
good deal of gold from Altai Mountains in central
Asia.
• The Kushans controlled the silk route which
started from China and passed through their
empire in central Asia and with the help of tolls
levied from the traders, Kushans built a large
empire. It is significant that the Kushans were the
first rulers in India to issue gold coins on a wide
scale.
Development of Religion
• Some of the foreign rulers were converted to vaishanavism.
• The Greek ambassador Heliodoros set up a pillar in honour of Vishnu near
Vidisa in Madhya Pradesh.
• The famous Greek ruler Menander was converted to Buddhism.
• The Kushan rulers worshipped both Shiva, and Buddha and the images of
these two gods appeared on the Kushan coins.
Political Life and Administration
• The Kushans and the Saka rulers assumed the title of ‘Devputra’ or the son
of God.
• They thus strengthened the concept of the divine origin of kingship.
• The Kushans defeated several of the Indian rulers but restored the
kingdoms if they acknowledged their over-lordships.
• It was the beginning of the feudal system in India.
Political Life and Administration
• The Kushan Empire was divided into smaller units which were governed by
the Kshatraps or Satraps.
• It was the beginning of the Kshatrapa system.
• They also started the curious practice of hereditary dual rule when both
father and the son ruled the same kingdom at the same time.
• This practice of military governorship was also started during this period
as these military governors were quite necessary to control the rebellious
people.
Social Life-New Elements in Indian Social Life
• The Bactrian’s, the Parthians, the Sakas and the Kushans came into India
and settled there permanently, thus becoming an integral part of the
Indian society.
• Thus they lost their separate social identity and they became completely
Indianized.
• Being brave and bold conquerors, they were admitted into the Indian
social system as member of the Kshatriya caste.
Religious Life
• Ist time Idol worship started in India.
• The goal of life also was changed from ‘Nirvana’ to the attainment of ‘Swarga’ or
heaven.
• The old language Pali was also discarded in favour of the Sanskrit and faith took
the place of logic.
• As a result of these changes, the Buddhism gained immense popularity and it
spread not only in India but also in several foreign countries like China, Japan,
Tibet and Central Asia.
Coinage
• Before the Greeks, the Indian coins were
rough and punch-marked.
• The Indians learnt from the Greeks the
art of moulding coins and they now
struck beautiful coins bearing
inscriptions on both the sides.
• The gold coins of Kanishka were also
beautiful and attractive with artistic
images of Gods and Goddesses on them.
The Gandhara School of Art
• Before the Kushans, the Gandhara School of
Art was developed as a result of interaction
between the Greeks and the Indians.
• But during the Kushan rule, the Gandhara
Art reached its zenith.
• This art had developed on the north-western
regions of India known as Gandhara.
• It was therefore called the Gandhara School
of Art or the Indo-Greek Art.
• The Gandhara artists built beautiful largesize images of the Buddha, Budhisatvas and
the Kushan rulers.
The Gandhara School of Art
• They depicted scenes from the life of the Buddha on stone. Most of the specimens
of the Ghandara Art relating to this period are executed in stone.
• But some of the specimens founded at Taxila are in stucco (lime), cement,
terracota (baked clay) and clay.
• The Gandhara Art greatly influenced other schools of Indian sculpture.
• The Greek influence is discernible even in the field of temple and palace
architecture.
• The Indians also learnt the art of cutting rock caves. In Maharashtra, there are
several rock-cut caves.
Literature and Learning
• The foreign rulers patronised Sanskrit and consequently the Sanskrit scholars
wrote several books of great quality.
• The Kushan rules were great lovers of knowledge and they patronised several
scholars which led to the creation of high quality Sanskrit literature particularly,
during the reign of Kanishka.
• Among the notable Sanskrit scholars of this period were Asvaghosha, Vasumitra
(chairman of 4
th Buddhist council), and Nagarjuna(wrote Madhyamik sutra and
gave the concept of Relativity so considered as Indian Einstein).
Literature and Learning
• Asvaghosha wrote the ‘Buddha Charita’, (and is considered as Ramayana of
Buddhist), Vatsyayana wrote Kamasutra. ‘Saundrananda’and ‘Sahputra’.
• Vasumitra wrote ‘Prajnaparmita’, ‘Sutra Shastra’ and ‘Mahavibhasha’.
• The use of curtain, which is called ‘Yavanika’ in Sanskrit, was started.
Science and Technology
• The Indians learnt a lot from the Greeks in the fields of astronomy and
astrology.
• They also learnt from the Kushans, the art of making leather shoes and
articles of glass.
• The Kushan coins were an imitation of the Roman coins.
Botany and Medicine
• Charka, the great Indian physician of this time, wrote ‘Charka Samhita’
which deals with various diseases and the effective herbs (aushadhis) to
cure them.

Foreign Trade and
Balance of Payment
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Definition and Components
• Balance of Payment (BOP) of a country can be defined as a systematic
statement of all economic transactions of a country with the rest of the
world during a specific period usually one year.

Definition and Components
• The Balance of Payments (BOP) is the method countries use to monitor all
international monetary transactions at a specific period of time.
• Usually, the BOP is calculated every quarter and every calendar year.
• All trades conducted by both the private and public sectors are accounted
for in the BOP in order to determine how much money is going in and out
of a country.
• Theoretically, the BOP should be zero, meaning that assets (credits) and
liabilities (debits) should balance.
Purposes of calculation of BOP
• 1. The basic purpose of BOP accounting is to know the strength and
weaknesses of the Economy in international relations.
• 2. By analyzing the BOP accounts of the last year one can come to know
the overall gains and losses from international trade.
• 3. BOP statements give warning signals for future policy formation.
• For preparing a BOP accounts, economic transactions between a
country and rest of the world are grouped under two broad
categories:
 A. Current Account
 B. Capital Account
 C. Financial Account
A. Current Account
• The BOT is typically the biggest bulk of a country's balance of payments as it
makes up total imports and exports.
• If a country has a balance of trade deficit, it imports more than it exports, and
if it has a balance of trade surplus, it exports more than it imports.
• Receipts from income-generating assets such as stocks (in the form of
dividends) are also recorded in the current account.
• The last component of the current account is unilateral transfers.
• These are credits that are mostly worker's remittances, which are salaries sent
back into the home country of a national working abroad, as well as foreign
aids that are directly received.
B. Capital Account
• Inflow and outflow of capital including foreign investment, gold and
foreign exchange reserves. This is of stock nature.
• The capital account is where all international capital transfers are
recorded.
• This refers to the acquisition or disposal of non-financial assets (for
example, a physical asset such as land) and non-produced assets, which
are needed for production but have not been produced, like a mine used
for the extraction of diamonds.
C. The Financial Account
• In the financial account, international monetary flows related to
investment in business, real estate, bonds and stocks are documented.
• Also included are government-owned assets such as foreign reserves,
gold, special drawing rights (SDRs) held with the International Monetary
Fund, private assets held abroad, and direct foreign investment.
• Assets owned by foreigners, private and official, are also recorded in the
financial account.
Convertibility of Rupee
• For the first time, the Union Budget for 1992-93 has made the Indian
rupee partially convertible.
• In order to face the serious current account deficit in the balance of
payments, the Government of India introduced the partial convertibility
of rupee from March 1. 1992.
• Under this system, which remained in operation for a period of one year,
60 per cent of the exchange earnings were convertible in rupees at market
determined exchange rate and the remaining 40 per cent earnings were
convertible in rupees at the officially determined exchange rate.
Convertibility of Rupee
• The term convertibility of a currency indicates that it can be freely
converted into any other currency.
• Convertibility can also be identified as the removal of quantitative
restrictions on trade and payments on current account.
• Convertibility establishes a system where the market place determines the
rate of exchange through the free interplay of demand and supply forces.
Current Account Convertibility
• Current account convertibility relates to the removal of restrictions on payments
relating to the international exchange of goods, services and factor incomes, while
capital account convertibility refers to a similar liberalization of a country’s capital
transactions such as loans and investment, both short term and long term.
• Current account convertibility has been defined as the freedom to buy or sell
foreign exchange for the following international transactions:
 (a) All payments due in connection with foreign trade, other current business,
including services and normal short term banking and credit facilities;
 (b) Payments due as interest on loans and as net income from other
investments;
 C) Moderate remittances for family living expenses.
Capital Account Convertibility
• Capital account convertibility refers to a liberalization of a country’s capital transactions
such as loans and investment, both short term and long term as well as speculative
capital flows.
• In a way, capital account convertibility removes all the restrains on international flows on
India’s capital account.
• There is a basic difference between current account convertibility and capital account
convertibility.
• In the case of current account convertibility, it is important to have a transaction –
importing and exporting of goods, buying and selling of services, inward or outward
remittances, etc. involving payment or receipt of one currency against another currency.
• In the case of capital account convertibility, a currency can be converted into any other
currency without any transaction.
Capital Account Convertibility
• With the growing strength of balance of payments in the post-1991 period
and with external sector remaining robust and gaining strength every year
RBI, in pursuance of the announcement the Prime Minister constituted a
committee on March 20, 2006 with Mr. S.S. Tarapore as its chairman for
setting out a roadways towards fuller capital account convertibility.
• The committee submitted its Report to the RBI on July 31, 2006.
Advantages of Currency Convertibility
• Export promotion
• Incentive to Import Substitution
• Incentive to send remittances from abroad : it makes illegal remittance
such ‘hawala money’ and smuggling of gold less attractive.
• Integration of World Economy
Preconditions for Capital Account Convertibility
• The Tarapore Committee recommended that, before adopting capital
account convertibility (CAC), India should fulfill three crucial preconditions:
 Fiscal deficit should be reduced to 2% per cent of GDP.
 The Governments should fix the annual inflation target below 4 per
cent.
 The Indian financial sector should be strengthened. For this, interest
rates should be deregulated.
Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20
• Commerce and Industry Minister unveiled foreign trade policy (FTP) 2015 -20,
which seek to provide higher incentive to agriculture industry.
• FTP also seeks to establish an institutional framework to work with state
governments to boost India’s exports.
• Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) and Service Exports from India
Scheme (SEIS) launched.
• The 'Services Exports from India Scheme' (SEIS) is for increasing exports of
notified services.
• These schemes (MEIS and SEIS) replace multiple schemes earlier in place.
• E-Commerce of handicrafts, handlooms, books etc., eligible for benefits of MEIS.
India’s Foreign Trade Policy
• Export obligation would be reduced by 25 per cent and incentives
available under the MEIS and SEIS would be extend to the units in the SEZs
to make them more attractive for investors.
• Further business services, hotel and restaurants would get rewards under
SEIS at the rate of 3 per cent and other specified services at the rate of 5
per cent.
• Export obligation reduced to 75% to promote domestic capital goods
manufacturing.
• FTP to be aligned to 'Make in India', 'Digital India' and 'Skills
India' initiatives.
India’s Foreign Trade Policy
• Agriculture and village industry products to be supported across the globe
at rates of 3% and 5% under MEIS.
• Industrial products to be supported in major markets at rates ranging from
2% to 3%.
• Two institutional mechanisms i.e. the board of trade will have an advisory
role, the council for trade development would have representation from
states and UT governments.
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1973
• Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) was promulgated in 1973 and it
came into force on January 1, 1974.
• According to the Section, all non-banking foreign branches and
subsidiaries with foreign equity exceeding 40 per cent had to obtain
permission to establish new undertakings, to purchase shares in existing
companies, or to acquire wholly or partly any other company.
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act
(FERA), 1973
• According to these guidelines, the principal rule was that all branches of
foreign companies operating in India should convert themselves into
Indian companies with at least 60 per cent local equity participation.
• Furthermore all subsidiaries of foreign should bring down the foreign
equity share to 40% or less.
• The actual impact of this act was completely negative on the economic
development of the country, because it tied the hands of big corporate
houses to expand their business, so it was felt by the policy makers that
there should be some relaxation in the act so that the economic
development through industrialization can be speed up in the country.
Foreign Exchange Management Act
(Fema), 1999
• The Foreign Exchange Management Bill (FEMA) was introduced by the
Government of India in Parliament on August 4, 1998.
• The Bill aims "to consolidate and amend the law relating to foreign
exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments
and for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign
exchange market in India.
Features of the FEMA
• a. It is consistent with fully current account convertibility and contains
provisions for progressive liberalization of capital account transactions.
• b. It classified the foreign exchange transactions in two categories, viz. capital
account and current account transactions.
• c. It gives full freedom to a person resident in India, who was earlier resident
outside India, to hold/own/transfer any foreign security/immovable property
situated outside India and acquired when s/he was resident.
• d. FEMA does not apply to Indian citizen’s resident outside India.
Exchange Rate Management in India
• Exchange rate is simply value of a currency in terms of another currency.
• The major functions of the foreign exchange include:
 I. Transferring currency from one market to other where it is needed in the
transactions.
 II. Providing short-term credit to the importers, and thereby facilitating the
smooth flow of goods and services between the countries.
 III. Stabilizing the foreign exchange rate market.
Exchange Management
• Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System: The Finance Minister
announced the liberalised exchange rate management system (LERMS) in
the Budget for 1992- 93.
• This system introduced partial convertibility of rupee.
• Under this system, a dual exchange rate was fixed under which 40 per cent
of foreign exchange earnings were to be surrendered at the official
exchange rate while the remaining 60 per cent were to be converted at a
market-determined rate.
Types of exchange rate management
A. Fixed Exchange Rate B. Flexible Exchange Rate
A. The Fixed Exchange Rate
• When the exchange rate between the domestic and foreign currencies is fixed
by the monetary authority of a country and is not allowed to fluctuate beyond
a limit, it is called fixed exchange rate.
• The basic purpose of adopting fixed exchange rate system is to ensure stability
in foreign trade and capital movements.
• Under fixed exchange rate system, the government assumes the responsibility
of ensuring stability of exchange rate. To this end, the government undertakes
to buy and sell the foreign currency.
• Buy when it becomes weaker and sell when it gets stronger.
• In practice, however, most countries adopt a dual system: a fixed exchange
rate for all official transactions and a market rate for private transactions.
B. Flexible Exchange Rate
• When the exchange rate is decided by the market force (demand and supply of
currency), it is called the flexible exchange rate.
• It is often argued that flexible exchange rate causes destabilization, uncertainty,
risk and speculation.
• It provides a good deal of autonomy in respect of domestic policies as it does
not require any obligatory constraints.
• This advantage is of great significance in the formulation of domestic economic
policies.
• It is self-adjusting and therefore it does not devolve on the government to
maintain an adequate foreign exchange reserves to stabilize the exchange rate.
• It creates conditions for certainty and stability.
SEZ: Special Economic Zone
• It is a specifically demarcated area of India which is deemed as foreign territory for the
purpose of Tax laws and Trade laws.
• Thus, they’re exempted from taxes and are subjected to lower rate of taxes of Union and
State Govts.
• They get single window clearance for various import / export licenses / permissions etc.
• Government will bear the cost of developing the roads, sewage and infrastructure within the
SEZ.
• They are regulated under SEZ policy (2000) and Special Economic Zone Act, 2005.
• 1965: Asia's first SEZ was set up in Kandla, Gujarat.
• Currently we’ve 220+ SEZ in India.
• Benefit: More exports, employment, economic growth.
Foreign Portfolio Investors: FPI
• It is a foreign entity registered with SEBI, and who buys upto 10 percent in equity / shares of
an Indian Company.
• Previously they were called Foreign Institutional Investor and Qualified Foreign Investors
(QFIs), but in 2013 SEBI merged them all into a single category- FPI, Based on the
recommendations of K.M. Chandrasekhar committee.
• FPI’s primary objective is make money from buying and selling of shares through the capital
market / share market.
• FPIs are not involved in the actual operations / production / management / business policy
making of a company.
• If FPI investor is hopeful to get better returns in the other countries’ share/bond market, he
may quickly sell his Indian securities and run away. The flight of such money is called ‘ hot
money ’.
• It results into weakening of Indian rupee and falling of Sensex.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
• FDI is the (more than 10% equity / share) investment made by a foreign
entity into an Indian company, with the objective to get involved in the
management / production of that Indian company.
• FDI is prohibited in atomic energy, railway operations (except Metro &
infra dev.); Tobacco Products, Real Estate Business.

FUNDAMENTAL
RIGHTS
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

 Introduction
• The Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution from
Articles 12 to 35.
• The framers of the Constitution derived inspiration from the Constitution of
USA (i.e., Bill of Rights).
• Part III of the Constitution is rightly described as the Magna Carta of India.
• It contains a very long and comprehensive list of ‘justiciable’ Fundamental
Rights.
• The Fundamental Rights are guaranteed by the Constitution to all persons
without any discrimination. **
• They uphold the equality of all individuals, the dignity of the individual, the
larger public interest and unity of the nation.
©StudyIQ Education
• In the original Constitution 7 Fundamental Rights are mentioned
1. Right to equality (Articles 14–18)
2 .Right to freedom (Articles 19–22)
3. Right against exploitation (Articles 23–24)
4. Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25–28)
5. Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29–30)
6. Right to property (Article 31)
7. Right to constitutional remedies (Article 32)
• The right to property was deleted from the list of Fundamental Rights by the 44th
Amendment Act, 1978.
• It is made a legal right under Article 300-A in Part XII of the Constitution. So at present,
there are only six types of Fundamental Rights.
©StudyIQ Education
Fundamental Rights
©StudyIQ Education
©StudyIQ Education
• Some of them are available only to the citizens while others are available to
all.
• The state can impose reasonable restrictions on them.
• However, whether such restrictions are reasonable or not is to be decided by
the courts.
• They are justiciable, allowing persons to move the courts for their
enforcement, if and when they are violated.
• They can be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency except
the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21.
• Further, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be suspended only when
emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external aggression (i.e.,
external emergency) and not on the ground of armed rebellion (i.e., internal
emergency).
©StudyIQ Education
Features of the Fundamental Rights:
• They can be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency except
the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21.
• Further, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be suspended only when
emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external aggression (i.e.,
external emergency) and not on the ground of armed rebellion (i.e., internal
emergency).
©StudyIQ Education
©StudyIQ Education
• Their scope of operation is limited by
 Article 31A (saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates, etc.),
 Article 31B (validation of certain acts and regulations included in the 9th
Schedule)
 Article 31C (saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles).
• Their application to the members of armed forces, para-military forces, police
forces, intelligence agencies and analogous services can be restricted or
abrogated by the Parliament (Article 33).
©StudyIQ Education
• Their application can be restricted while martial law is in force in any area.
(Note: Martial law means ‘military rule’ imposed under abnormal circumstances
to restore order (Article 34). It is different from the imposition of national
emergency.)
• Most of them are directly enforceable (self-executory) while a few of them
can be enforced on the basis of a law made for giving effect to them.
©StudyIQ Education
Article 12 has defined the term ‘STATE’ for the purposes of Part III.
According to it, the State includes the following:
(a)Government and Parliament of India, that is, executive and legislative organs of the
Union government.
(b) Government and legislature of states, that is, executive and legislative organs of state
government.
(c) All local authorities, that is, municipalities, panchayats, district boards, improvement
trusts, etc.
(d) All other authorities, that is, statutory or non-statutory authorities like LIC, ONGC,
SAIL, etc.
*Note:
According to the Supreme Court, even a private body or an agency working as an
instrument of the State falls within the meaning of the ‘State’ under Article 12.
©StudyIQ Education
Article 12
• Article 13 declares that all laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of
any of the fundamental rights shall be void.
• In other words, it expressively provides for the doctrine of judicial review.
• This power has been conferred on the Supreme Court (Article 32) and the
high courts (Article 226) that can declare a law unconstitutional and invalid on
the ground of contravention of any of the Fundamental Rights.
*Note:
The words Judicial Review are not mentioned in the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Article 13
• Article 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the
law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.

privileges conferred and liabilities imposed by the laws,
(b) the similar application of the same laws to all persons who are similarly
situated, and
(c) the like should be treated alike without any discrimination.

• Article 15 provides that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on
grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.

(b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, road and places of public resort maintained
wholly or partly by State funds or dedicated to the use of general public.
This provision prohibits discrimination both by the State and private individuals,
while the first provision prohibits discrimination only by the State.
Article 15: Prohibition of Discrimination on Certain Grounds
• Article 16 provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in
matters of employment or appointment to any office under the State.
• No citizen can be discriminated against or be ineligible for any
employment or office under the State on grounds of only religion,
race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence.

©StudyIQ Education
Article 18: Abolition of Titles
Note:
In 1996, the Supreme Court , in Balaji Raghavan vs. Union of India
upheld the constitutional validity of the National Awards—Bharat Ratna, Padma
Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padma Sri.
It ruled that these awards do not amount to ‘titles’ within the meaning of Article
18 that prohibits only hereditary titles of nobility.
However, it also ruled that they should not be used as suffixes or prefixes to the
names of awardees. Otherwise, they should forfeit the awards.
**In December 2013 the High Court of Andhra Pradesh ordered two cinema
personalities Mohan Babu and Bramhanandam to surrender ‘Padma Sri’ to the
President.
©StudyIQ Education
These National Awards were instituted in 1954.
The Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai discontinued
them in 1977.
But they were again revived in 1980 by the Indira Gandhi government.
©StudyIQ Education

It contains three provisions in that direction:
(a)No ex-post-facto law: No person shall be
 (i) convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the

• Article 21 declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal
liberty except according to procedure established by law.
• This right is available to both citizens and non-citizens.
• It also ruled that the expression ‘Personal Liberty’ in Article 21 is of the
widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights that go to constitute the

• Elementary education = fundamental right
*Note: This was present in article 45 of the Constitution (DPSP).
Through 86th Amendment act 2002, it was made a fundamental right.
This came into force on April, 2010.
Also added Fundamental duty 51 A (k)
Article 21 A: Right to Education
Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or detained.
Detention is of two types
1. Punitive detention is to punish a person for an offence committed by him after trial
and conviction in a court.
2. Preventive detention ,means detention of a person without trial and conviction by
a court.
Its purpose is not to punish a person for a past offence but to prevent him from
committing an offence in the near future. Thus, preventive detention is only a
precautionary measure and based on suspicion
Article 22: Protection Against Arrest and Detention.
• The Article 22 has two parts—the first part deals with the cases of ordinary law and the
second part deals with the cases of preventive detention law.
(a) The first part of Article 22 confers the following rights on a person who is arrested
or detained under an ordinary law (punitive):
(i) Right to be informed of the grounds of arrest.
(ii) Right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner.
(iii) Right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours, excluding the journey time
(iv) Right to be released after 24 hours unless the magistrate authorises further
detention.
These safeguards are not available to an alien or a person arrested or detained under a
preventive detention law.
(b) The second part of Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or
detained under a preventive detention law.
(i) The detention of a person cannot exceed three months unless an advisory board
reports sufficient cause for extended detention. The board is to consist of judges
of a high court.
This protection is available to both citizens as well as aliens
Article 22 also authorises the Parliament to prescribe
(a) the circumstances and the classes of cases in which a person can be detained for
more than three months under a preventive detention law without obtaining the
opinion of an advisory board;
(b) the maximum period for which a person can be detained in any classes of cases
under a preventive detention law; and
(c) the procedure to be followed by an advisory board in an inquiry.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 has reduced the period of detention without
obtaining the opinion of an advisory board from three to two months. However,
this provision has not yet been brought into force, hence, the original period of
three months still continues.
• Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings, begar (forced labour) and other
similar forms of forced labour.
• Any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in
accordance with law.
• This right is available to both citizens and non-citizens.
• It protects the individual not only against the State but also against private
persons.
Article 23: Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced
Labour
• Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in
any factory, mine or other hazardous activities like construction work or
railway.
• But it does not prohibit their employment in any harmless or innocent work.
In 2006, the government banned the employment of children as domestic
servants or workers in business establishments like hotels, dhabas, restaurants,
shops, factories, resorts, spas, tea-shops and so on.
Anyone employing children below 14 years of age would be liable for prosecution
and penal action.
Article 24: Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories
Child Labour Amendment (2016)
• The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, amended
the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986.
• It has renamed the Principal Act as the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition
and Regulation) Act, 1986.
• The Amendment Act prohibits the employment of children below
14 years in all occupations and processes.
• Earlier, this prohibition was applicable to 18 occupations and 65 processes.
• Further, the Amendment Act prohibits the employment of adolescents (14
to 18 years of age) in certain hazardous occupations and processes.
• The Amendment Act also introduces more stringent punishment for the
offenders. It is an imprisonment of 6 months to 2 years, or a fine of 20,000
to 50,000, or both.
• In case of repeated offences, the imprisonment is of 1 year to 3 years
• All persons are equally entitled to:
(a) Freedom of conscience: Inner freedom of an individual to mould his
relation with God or Creatures in whatever way he desires.
(b) Right to profess: Declaration of one’s religious beliefs and faith openly
and freely.
(c) Right to practice: Performance of religious worship, rituals, ceremonies
and exhibition of beliefs and ideas.
(d) Right to propagate: Transmission and dissemination of one’s religious
beliefs to others or exposition of the tenets of one’s religion.
Article 25: Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and
Propagation of Religion
• But, it does not include a right to convert another person to one’s own
religion. Forcible conversions impinge on the ‘freedom of conscience’
guaranteed to all the persons alike.
• Available to all persons—citizens as well as non-citizens.
• According to Article 26, every religious denomination or any of its section
shall have the following rights:
(a)Right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable
purposes;
(b)Right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;
(c)Right to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and
(d)Right to administer such property in accordance with law.
Article 26: Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs
Article 25 guarantees rights of individuals,
Article 26 guarantees rights of religious denominations or their sections.
In other words, Article 26 protects collective freedom of religion.
Like the rights under Article 25, the rights under Article 26 are also subject to
public order, morality and health but not subject to other provisions
relating to the Fundamental Rights.
• Article 27 lays down that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for
the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious
denomination.
• The State should not spend the public money collected by way of tax for the
promotion or maintenance of any particular religion.
• This provision prohibits the State from favouring, patronising and supporting
one religion over the other.
• This means that the taxes can be used for the promotion or maintenance of
all religions.
Article 27: Freedom from Taxation for Promotion of a Religion
• Under Article 28, no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational
institution wholly maintained out of State funds.
• However, this provision shall not apply to an educational institution
administered by the State but established under any endowment or trust,
requiring imparting of religious instruction in such institution.
Article 28: Freedom from Attending Religious Instruction.
Article 28 distinguishes between four types of educational institutions:
(a) Institutions wholly maintained by the State.
(b) Institutions administered by the State but established under any
endowment/trust.
(c) Institutions recognised by the State.
(d) Institutions receiving aid from the State.
(a)- religious instruction is completely prohibited
(b) - religious instruction is permitted.
(c), (d) - religious instruction is permitted on a voluntary basis.
• Article 29 provides that any section of the citizens residing in any part of India
having a distinct language, script or culture of its own, shall have the right to
conserve the same.
• No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution
maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of
religion, race, caste, or language.
Article 29: Protection of Interests of Minorities
• Article 29 grants protection to both religious minorities as well as linguistic
minorities.
• However, the Supreme Court held that the scope of this article is not
necessarily restricted to minorities only, as it is commonly assumed to be.
• This is because of the use of words ‘section of citizens’ in the Article that
include minorities as well as majority.
Article 30 grants the following rights to minorities, whether religious or linguistic:
(a) All minorities shall have the right to establish and administer educational
institutions of their choice.
(b) The compensation amount fixed by the State for the compulsory acquisition
of any property of a minority educational institution shall not restrict or abrogate
the right guaranteed to them.
(c) In granting aid, the State shall not discriminate against any educational
institution managed by a minority.
Article 30: Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer
Educational Institution
• The right under Article 30 also includes the right of a minority to impart
education to its children in its own language.
• The protection under Article 30 is confined only to minorities (religious or
linguistic) and does not extend to any section of citizens (as under Article
29).
** The term ‘minority’ has not been defined anywhere in the Constitution.
• A mere declaration of fundamental rights in the Constitution is meaningless,
useless and worthless without providing an effective machinery for their
enforcement, if and when they are violated.
• Hence, Article 32 confers the right to remedies for the enforcement of the
fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen.
• the right to get the Fundamental Rights protected is in itself a fundamental
right. This makes the fundamental rights real. That is why Dr Ambedkar called
Article 32 as the most important article of the Constitution—‘an Article
without which this constitution would be a nullity. It is the very soul of the
Constitution and the very heart of it’.
• The Supreme Court has ruled that Article 32 is a basic feature of the
Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)
• A writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or
judicial jurisdiction.
• In India,
 the Supreme Court (under Article 32) and the
 high courts (under Article 226)
can issue the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and
quo-warranto.
• These writs are borrowed from English law.
©StudyIQ Education
What is a ‘WRIT’ ?
The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court differs from that of a high court in three
respects:
1. The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental
rights whereas a high court can issue writs not only for the enforcement of
Fundamental Rights but also for any other purpose (legal rights)
 HC scope >> SC scope
2. SC jurisdiction >> HC jurisdiction
3. Supreme Court may not refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction.
 a remedy under Article 226 is discretionary and hence, a high court may refuse to
exercise its writ jurisdiction.
The Supreme Court is constituted as a defender and guarantor of the fundamental
rights.

• It is a Latin term which literally means ‘to have the body of’.
• It is an order issued by the court to a person who has detained another
person, to produce the body of the latter before it.
• The writ of habeas corpus can be issued against both public authorities as
well as private individuals.
©StudyIQ Education
Habeas Corpus
• It literally means ‘we command’.
• It is a command issued by the court to a public official asking him to perform
his official duties that he has failed or refused to perform.
• It can also be issued against any public body, a corporation, an inferior court,
a tribunal or government for the same purpose.
©StudyIQ Education
Mandamus
• The writ of mandamus cannot be issued
(a) against a private individual or body; (b) against the president of India or the state governors; and
(c) against the chief justice of a high court acting in judicial capacity.
©StudyIQ Education
• Literally, it means ‘to forbid’.
• It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent the latter
from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a jurisdiction that it does not
possess.
• Thus, unlike mandamus that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity.
• The writ of prohibition can be issued only against judicial and quasi-judicial
authorities.
• It is not available against administrative authorities, legislative bodies, and
private individuals or bodies.
©StudyIQ Education
Prohibition
• In the literal sense, it means ‘to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’.
• It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a
case pending with the latter to itself or to squash the order of the latter in a
case.
• It is issued on the grounds of excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or
error of law.
• Thus, unlike prohibition, which is only preventive, certiorari is both
preventive as well as curative.
• Previously, the writ of certiorari could be issued only against judicial and
quasi-judicial authorities and not against administrative authorities.
• Like prohibition, certiorari is also not available against legislative bodies and
private individuals or bodies.

Certiorari
• In the literal sense, it means ‘by what authority or warrant’.
• It is issued by the court to enquire into the legality of claim of a person to a
public office.
• The writ can be issued only in case of a substantive public office of a
permanent character created by a statute or by the Constitution. It cannot be
issued in cases of ministerial office or private office.

• Article 33 empowers the Parliament to restrict or abrogate the fundamental
rights of the members of armed forces, para-military forces, police forces,
intelligence agencies and analogous forces.
• The objective of this provision is to ensure the proper discharge of their
duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.

Article 35
Right to Property
• Originally, the right to property was one of the seven fundamental rights
under Part III of the Constitution.
• Article 19(1)(f) guaranteed to every citizen the right to acquire, hold and
dispose of property.
• Article 31, on the other hand, guaranteed to every person, whether citizen
or non-citizen, right against deprivation of his property.
• It provided that no person shall be deprived of his property except by
authority of law.
©StudyIQ Education
It empowered the State to acquire or requisition the property of a person on two
conditions:
(a) it should be for public purpose, and
(b) it should provide for payment of compensation (amount) to the owner.
©StudyIQ Education
• 44th Amendment Act of 1978 abolished the right to property as a
Fundamental Right by repealing Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31
• Instead, the Act inserted a new Article 300A in Part XII under the heading
‘Right to Property’.
• It provides that no person shall be deprived of his property except by
authority of law.
• Thus, the right to property still remains a legal right or a constitutional
right, though no longer a fundamental right. (it can be changed/modified by
law now)
• It is not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

 He failed as a practicing lawyer both at Rajkot and in Bombay
 In 1893, he proceeded to Natal, South Africa in relation with a case involving his
client, Dada Abdullah.
 In South Africa, he witnessed apartheid (Racial discrimination) to which Asians
who had gone to South Africa as labourers were subjected.
 He decided to stay in South Africa to organise the Indian workers to enable them
to fight for their rights.
 He stayed there till 1914.
 Returned on 9 January 1915
**Pravasi Bharatiya Divas

 The third and final phase of the Nationalist Movement [1917-1947] is known as
the Gandhian era.
 During this period Mahatma Gandhi became the undisputed leader of the
National Movement.
 His principles of non-violence and Satyagraha were employed against the
British Government.
 Gandhi made the nationalist movement a mass movement.
‘Satyagraha’ = passive resistance or civil disobedience
"insistence on truth”
Or
"Truth-force."
Gandhi evolved the technique during his stay in South Africa, which was based on
truth and non-violence. Its basic tenets were —
 A Satyagrahi was not to submit to what he considered as wrong, but was to
always remain truthful, non-violent and fearless.
 A true Satyagrahi would never bow before the evil, whatever the consequence.
 He should be ready to accept suffering in his struggle against the evil doer.
 This suffering was to be a part of his love for truth.
 Even while carrying out his struggle against the evil doer, a true Satyagrahi
would love the evil-doer; hatred would be alien to his nature.
 Only the brave and strong could practise Satyagraha, which was not for the weak
& cowards, even violence was preferred to cowardice.
Champaran Satyagraha (1917)
• First Civil Disobedience Movement (सविनय अिज्ञा)
• Raj Kumar Shukla asked Gandhi to look into the problems of the indigo
planters
• The European planters had been forcing peasants to grow Indigo on 3/20
of the total land (called tinkathia system).
• Towards the end of the 19th century, German synthetic dyes replaced
indigo
• European planters demanded high rents and illegal dues from the peasants.
• Besides, the peasants were forced to sell the produce at prices fixed by the
European.
 When Gandhi reached Champaran to probe into the matter, the authorities
ordered him to leave the area at once.
 Gandhi defied the order and preferred to face the punishment.
 This passive resistance or civil disobedience of an unjust order was a novel
method at that time.
 Finally, the authorities relented and permitted Gandhi to make an enquiry.
 Government appointed a committee to look into the matter and nominated
Gandhi as a member.
 Gandhi was able to convince the authorities that the tinkathia system should be
abolished and the peasants should be compensated for the illegal dues extracted
from them.
 As a compromise with the planters, he agreed that only 25 % of the money taken
should be compensated.
 Within a decade, the planters left the area.
Kheda Satyagraha (1918)
 First Non-Cooperation Movement (असहयोग)
 Because of drought in 1918, crops failed in Kheda district of Gujarat.
 According to Revenue Code, if the yield was less than 1/4
th of the normal
produce, the farmers were entitled to remission.
 The authorities refused to grant remission.
 Gandhi supported the peasants cause and asked them to withhold revenue.
 During the Kheda Satyagraha, many young nationalists such as Sardar Patel and
Indulal Yagnik became Gandhi’s followers.
Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918)
 First Hunger Strike
 Gandhi now intervened in a dispute between mill owners of Ahmedabad and the
workers over the issue of discontinuation of the plague bonus.
 Gandhi asked the workers to go on a strike and demand a 35 % increase in wages.
 The employers were willing to concede a 20 % bonus only.
 Gandhi advised the workers to remain non-violent while on strike.
 He undertook a fast unto death to strengthen the worker’s resolve.
 Mill owners finally agreed to give the workers a 35 % increase in wages.
Satyagraha against Rowlatt Act (First Mass Strike)
Rowlatt Act, 1919
 Passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi on March 18, 1919
 Extension of the Defence of India Act 1915
 Also known as Black Act
 Was mainly aimed to look into the militant Nationalist activities.
 Any person could be arrested on the basis of suspicion.
 They gave enormous powers to the police to search a place and arrest any person
they disapproved of, without warrant.
 No appeal or petition could be filed against such arrests for up to 2 years
 Gandhi organised a Satyagraha Sabha and roped in younger members of Home
Rule Leagues and the Pan Islamists.
 The forms of protest finally chosen included observance of a nationwide
hartal (strike) accompanied by fasting and prayer, and civil disobedience
against specific laws, and courting arrest and imprisonment.
There was a radical change in the national movement by now—
 The masses had found a direction; now they could “act’’ instead of just giving
verbal expression to their grievances.
 From now onwards, peasants, artisans and the urban poor were to play an
increasingly important part in the struggle.
 Orientation of the national movement turned to the masses permanently.
A well known description of the bill at that time was:
 No Dalil, No Vakil, No Appeal
 No pleas, No lawyer, no Appeal.
Gandhi called for a nationwide protest against the draconian law in
Feb 1919.
Jalianwalla Bagh Massacre April 13, 1919
 In Punjab, there was an unprecedented support to the Rowlatt Satyagraha.
 Facing a violent situation and suspected insurrection, Government called in large
number of military troops
 Military was led by Brig. General Dyer.
 General Dyer banned all public meetings and detained the political leaders.
 On Baisakhi day, a large, crowd of people mostly from neighbouring villages,
unaware of the prohibitory orders in the city
 They had gathered in this small park to protest against the arrest of their leaders,
Dr.Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr.Satyapal
 The Army surrounded the gathering under orders from General Dyer
 They blocked the only exit point and opened fire on the unarmed crowd.
 This resulted in nationwide protest against this massacre
 Even London newspapers criticised the Govt for the act
 Rabindranath Tagore renounced his knighthood as a protest.
 Gandhi was overwhelmed by atmosphere of violence and withdrew the Rowlatt
Satyagraha movement on April 18, 1919.
 The British government released figures stating 379 dead and 1,200 wounded.
 Other sources place the number of dead at well over 1,000.
 This "brutality stunned the entire nation“, resulting in a "wrenching loss of
faith" of the general public in the intentions of the UK.
 The ineffective inquiry and the initial accolades for Dyer by the House of Lords
fuelled widespread anger
NOTE --
 The governor of Punjab at the time, Michael O'Dwyer , supported
the massacre.
 He was shot dead by Udham singh, a revolutionary, in London in
1940

Glacial Landforms
& Cycle of Erosion
By Dr Vipan
Goyal

Glacial Landforms and Cycle of Erosion
• A glacier is a moving mass of ice at
speeds averaging few meters a day.
• The permanently ice-covered regions on
the earth surface are called as snowfields. The lowest limit of permanent
snow or snow-field is called as the
snowline.
• A Glacier forms in areas where the
accumulation of snow exceeds its
ablation (melting and sublimation) over
many years.
• They form features like crevasses,
seracs etc.
• A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture,
found in an ice sheet or glacier, as
opposed to a crevice that forms in
rock.
• A serac is a block or column of glacial
ice, often formed by intersecting
crevasses on a glacier.
• Glaciers cover about 10 percent of
Earth’s land surface and they are the
largest freshwater reservoirs on earth.
• Types of Glaciers:
• The continental glaciers are found in
the Antarctica and in Greenland. They
move outward in all directions.
• Ice caps are the covers of snow and
ice on mountains from which the
valley or mountain glaciers originate.
• The piedmont glaciers form a
continuous ice sheet at the base of
mountains as in southern Alaska.
• Valley/Mountain Glaciers: Move from
higher elevation to lower
Glacial Landforms and Cycle of Erosion
• The valley glaciers, also known as Alpine glaciers, are
found in higher regions of the Himalayas in our
country and all such high mountain ranges of the
world.
• The largest of Indian glaciers occur in the Karakoram
range, viz. Siachen (72 km), while Gangotri in Uttar
Pradesh (Himalayas) is 25.5 km long.
• A glacier during its lifetime creates various landforms
which may be classified into erosional and
depositional landforms.
Cirque/Corrie
• They are deep, long and wide troughs
or basins with very steep concave to
vertically dropping high walls at its
head as well as sides.
• They are simply a bowl-shaped
depression formed due to the
erosional activity of glaciers.
• When these depressions are filled
with water, they are called as Cirque
lake or Corrie Lake or Tarn Lakes.
Glacial Trough
• Original stream-cut valley, further
modified by glacial action.
• It is a ‘U’ Shaped Valley with steep
sided and flat bottomed valley. It at
mature stage of valley formation.
• Since glacial mass is heavy and slow
moving, erosional activity is uniform –
horizontally as well as vertically.
Hanging Valley
• They are most commonly associated
with U-shaped valleys when a tributary
glacier flows into a glacier of larger
volume.
• Hanging valleys are typically formed when
the main valley has been widened and
deepened by glacial erosion, leaving the
side valley cut off abruptly from the main
valley below. The steep drop from
the hanging valley to the main valley floor
usually creates cascading waterfalls.
D-Fjord
• A fjord is a very deep glacial trough
filled with sea water and making up
shorelines.
• A fjord is formed when a glacier
cuts a U-shaped valley by ice
segregation and abrasion of the
surrounding bedrock and this valley
gradually gets filled with the
seawater (formed in mountains
near by sea).
• Fjords are common in Norway,
Greenland and New Zealand.
Horns and Aretes
• Horns are sharp pointed and
steep-sided peaks.
• They are formed by headward
erosion of cirque wall.
• When the divide between two
cirque walls gets narrow because
of progressive erosions, it results
in the formation of a saw-toothed
ridge called Arete.
•
Glacial Erosional Landforms
Glacial Depositional Landforms
• Glacial deposits are of two
types:
• Glacial Till :unassorted coarse
and fine debris;
• Outwash :assorted roughly
stratified deposits.
Moraines
• Moraines are rock fragments, gravel, sand, etc.
carried by a glacier.
• When these deposits are at the end of a glacier, they
are called as Terminal moraines and
• when they are deposited on both sides, they are
called as Lateral moraines.
• When lateral moraines of two glaciers join together,
they form Medial moraines.
• When the lateral moraines of both sides of a glacier
join together, it forms a horse-shoe shape.
Esker
 When glaciers melt in summer, the water
which formed as a result of melting
accumulates beneath the glacier and flows
like streams in channels beneath that ice.
 Very coarse material like boulders, blocks
and some minor fractions of rock deposited
in the valleys itself and once the ice melts
completely, they are visible to the surface
as ridges and are called as Eskers.
 The eskers resemble the features of an
embankment and are often used for making
roads.
Glacial Depositional Landforms
• Outwash Plain
 When the glacier reaches its lowest
point and melts, it leaves behind a
stratified deposition material,
consisting of rock debris, clay, sand,
gravel etc. This layered surface is
called till plain or an outwash plain.
• Kame Terraces
 Broken ridges or un-assorted
depositions looking like hump in a
till plain.
Drumlins
• They are smooth oval-shaped
ridge-like structures
composed mainly of glacial
till.
• It shapes like an inverted
spoon with the highest part is
called as Stoss End and the
lowest narrow part is called
as Tail End or lee slope.
Kettle Holes
 Formed when the
deposited material in a
till plain gets depressed
locally and forms a
basin.
Glacial Depositional Landforms
Glacial Cycle of Erosion
• Youth
 The stage is marked by the inward cutting
activity of ice in a cirque.
 Aretes and horns are emerging. The
hanging valleys are not prominent at this
stage.
• Maturity
 Hanging valleys start emerging. The
opposite cirques come closer and the
glacial trough acquires a stepped profile
which is regular and graded.
Glacial Cycle of Erosion
• Old Age
 Emergence of a ‘U’-
shaped valley marks the
beginning of old age.
 An outwash plain with
features such as eskers,
kame terraces, drumlins,
kettle holes etc. is a
prominent development.

Government of India Act
 1935
Government of India Act of 1935 was passed on the basis of –
 the report of the Simon Commission
 the outcome of the Round Table Conferences
 the White Paper issued by the British Government in 1933
Features/Provisions of 1935 Act
 Provision for the establishment of an All India Federation at the Centre,
consisting of the Provinces of British India and the Princely States
 Did not come into existence since the Princely States refused to give their
consent for the union
 Division of powers into three lists –
1. Federal List (59)
2. Provincial List (54)
3. Concurrent List (36)
 Introduction of Diarchy at the Centre
The Governor-General and his councillors administered the “Reserved
subjects”
The Council of Ministers were responsible for the “Transferred” subjects
 Abolition of Diarchy and the introduction of Provincial Autonomy in
the provinces.
 Provincial Legislatures of Bengal, Madras, Bombay, United Provinces,
Bihar and Assam were made bicameral.(6 out of 11)
 The working of the provincial autonomy was not successful.
 The Governors were not bound to accept the advice of the ministers.
 In reality, the real power in the Provincial Government was with the
Governor.
 But, despite these drawbacks in the scheme, the Congress decided to take
part in the elections to the Provincial Legislatures with the consideration
that it was an improvement over the previous Acts.
* Provincial Elections in 1937 – INC swept to power in 7 provinces
 Extension/Continuation of the principle of Separate Electorates to
 Sikhs
 Europeans
 Indian Christians
 Anglo Indians
 Establishment of a Federal Court at Delhi with a Chief Justice and 6
judges.
 Establishment of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the year 1935.
 (Recommended by Hilton-Young Commission)
 Separation of Burma from India

• He was followed by many successors.
• The last recognised king of the Gupta line was
Vishnugupta who reigned from 540 to 550 AD.
Decline of the Gupta Empire
• The Gupta decline started during the reign of Skandagupta, the grandson of
Chandragupta II.
• He was successful in retaliating against the Huns and the Pushyamitras, but his
empire was drained of finances and resources because of this.

Narendrasena of western Deccan attacked Malwa, Mekala and Kosala.

from the Guptas.
• During Skandagupta’s reign, the Huns invaded northwest India but were
restricted.

Gandhara. The Hun invasion weakened the Gupta hold in the country.
Decline of the Gupta Empire

Malwa, the Maukharis of U.P., the Maitrakas in Saurashtra, and others in
Bengal.

joined forces with Narasimhagupta to successfully retaliate against the
Hun chief Mihirakula.)

was responsible for the peace and war. Harisena held this title.
Art and Architecture during the Gupta Empire
• Gupta age is called golden age of India in field of art, science & literature

Garhwas (near Allahabad) was great source of showing effects of
the Gupta art.
Facts
• During the Gupta period Metallurgy also made a wonderful impact. The
craftsmen were expert in their art of casting metal statues and pillars.
• The most antique item in Sultanganj/Bihar which is the huge copper
statue of Buddha. This is now kept at Birmingham museum,England was
of seven and a half feet height and a ton weight.
• The Delhi Iron pillar of the Gupta period is rust free even today.
• Chandragupta II and his successors also issued gold, silver and copper
coins.

Harshavardhana
Vakatakas
Chalukyan
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Harshavardhana (606 – 647 AD)
• After Gupta’s decline, Harshavardhana, a ruler of
Thanesar, Haryana extended his authority.
• Harshavardhana was born in 590 AD to King
Prabhakaravardhana of Sthaneshvara (Thanesar,
Haryana).
• He belonged to the Pushyabhuti also called Vardhana
dynasty.
• He was a Hindu who later embraced Mahayana
Buddhism.
• He was married to Durgavati.
Rise to the throne
• After Prabhakaravardhana died, his elder son Rajyavardhana ascended to
the throne of Thanesar.
• Harsha had a sister, Rajyashri who was married to king Grahavarman of
Kannauj.
• Sasanka, the Gauda king killed Grahavarman and kept Rajyashri prisoner.
• This prompted Rajyavardhana to fight against Sasanka. But Sasanka killed
Rajyavardhana.
Rise to the throne
• This led the 16-year old Harshavardhana to ascend the throne of Thanesar
in 606 AD.
• He vowed to avenge his brother’s murder and also rescue his sister.
• For this, he forged an alliance with Bhaskaravarman, the Kamarupa king.
• Harsha and Bhaskaravarman marched against Sasanka.
• Ultimately, Sasanka left for Bengal and Harsha became the king of Kannauj
also.
Annexation of Kannauj
• Harshavardhana made Kannauj his capital & seat of power & became last
great Hindu ruler of North India
• After the fall of the Guptas, North India was divided into many small
kingdoms.
• Harsha was able to unite many of them under his command.
• He had under his control Punjab and central India.
• After Sasanka’s death, he annexed Bengal, Bihar and Odisha.
• He also defeated the Vallabhi king in
Gujarat. (The Vallabhi king and Harsha
came to a truce by a marriage between
Harsha’s daughter and the Vallabhi king
Dhruvabhata.)
• However, Harsha’s plans to conquer lands
to the south were hampered when the
Chalukya king, Pulakesin II defeated
Harsha in 618-619 A.D.
• This sealed Harsha’s southern territorial
limit as the Narmada River.
• There were two types of territories under Harsha.
• One was directly under him and the other type was those that were feudatories.
 Direct territories: Central Provinces, Bengal, Kalinga, Rajputana, Gujarat
 Feudatories: Jalandhar, Kashmir, Kamarupa, Sind, Nepal
• Even the feudatories were under the tight command of Harsha.
• Hiuen Tsang visited India during Harsha’s reign.
• He has given a very favourable account of king Harsha
and his empire.
• He praises his generosity and justice.
• Harsha was a great patron of the arts.
• He himself was an accomplished writer. He is credited
with the Sanskrit works Ratnavali, Priyadarshika and
Nagananda.
• Banabhatta was his court poet and he composed the
Harshacharita which gives an account of Harsha’s life
and deeds.
Interest in Literature
• Nagananda: It describes the story of the Jimutavahana’s self-sacrifice to save the
Nagas.
• Ratnavali: Ratnavali is a great drama, which narrates the story of a princess called
Ratnavali and a king called Udayana.
• Ratnavali is probably the earliest textual references to the celebration of Holi, the
festival of colors.
• Priyadarsika: Priyadarsika is another great play by Harsha.
• Harsha generously supported the Nalanda University.
• He had a good tax structure.
• In Harsha’s Empire, the king’s share was one-sixth of the agricultural produce.
• 1/4th of all the taxes collected were used for charity and for cultural purposes.
• Harsha was a competent military conqueror and an able administrator.
• Harsha was the last king to rule over a vast empire in India before the invasions by
the Muslims.
Conflict with Pulkesin II
• However, his long career of victory was eclipsed by one great failure against
Pulkesin II.
• Pulkesin II, the greatest of the Chalukya dynasty vied with Harsha and was able to
stop the ambitions of Harsha towards south.
• If Harsha was Uttarpathapati, Pulkesin II, the Chalukya King of Vatapi was able to
raise himself to the rank of lord paramount of the South and called
himself Dakshinapathapati.
• The defeat of Harshavardhana in the hands of Pulakesin II is mentioned on Aihole
inscription (Karnataka). He was the first North Indian king to be defeated by South
Indian King.
Conquest of Ganjam:
• The last conquest of Harsha was the Ganjam in modern Odisha.
• Harsha was not able to annex initially because of his enmity
with Shashanka.
• However, Ganjam was conquered in 642-643 AD and after that, Harsha
became content to sheathe the sword.
• The later part of Harsha’s life is almost an imitation to the Great Asoka
Maurya, but it took 37 years and numerous conquests to Harsha to adopt
the Asoka route.
Religion
• Harsha was last great Hindu king of North India.
• After the Ganjam conquest, Harsha started showing the favor for
the quietest teachings of Buddhism.
• He favored the Hinyana initially and Mahayana later.
• He forbade the slaughter of any living thing.
• Use of animal flesh was a punishable offense in his reign.
Religion
• Father of Harsha was a Sun Devotee,
• His remote ancestor Pushyabhuti was a Shiva follower,
• His brother Rajyavardhana and sister Rajyashri were Buddhism devotees,
• But Harsha was benevolent of all the three and erected temples also.
• However, the in the closing part of his reign, his favorite was the faith of
Buddhism.
• We find King Harsha’s autograph in Baanskhera inscription of Haryana.
• In his early life, Harsha was devoted to Shiva but later he became an
ardent Mahayana Buddhist under the influence of Chinese pilgrim Hieun
Tsang. He organised two assemblies :
• Kannauj Assembly Harsha organised a Kannauj assembly to honour
Chinese pilgrim Huan Tsang where he explained doctrines of Mahayana
Buddhism & claimed his superiority over others
• Prayag Assembly : 2
nd Mahayana Buddhism assembly by Harsha, marked
by great charity of Harsha where he even gave up his cloths as charity
• Who is Bhandi ?
• Bhandi was a leading noble of Kannauj and on advice of the political
leaders of Kannauj; he offered the crown of Kannauj to Harsha after death
of Grahavarmana.
• Bhandi was later described as one of the chief officers of Harsha.
• When Harsha chased Shashanka for release of his sister, through Bhandi
only Harsha could know that his sister has been released and Shashanka
has escaped.
• Who is Simhanada ?
• Simhanada was the General of the Harsha’s army and his Prime Minister.
• When Harsha was preparing to conquest the South, Simhanada warned
him about the dreadful consequences.
• This was for the first time that Harsha did not pay attention to his
seasoned councilor and paid the price for the same when Pulkesin II
defeated him.
Administration in Harshavardhana’s Reign
• The revenues of Harsha’s Empire were divided into four parts.
• The first part was spent on the king.
• The second part was spent on scholars.
• The third part was spent on public servants and the fourth part was spent
on religious activities.
• The administration during Harsha’s reign was similar to that of the Guptas.
Hiuen Tsang has described it in much detail.
• The administration was more feudal and decentralized during Harsh’s
reign as compared to that of the Guptas.
Administration in Harshavardhana’s Reign
• Harsha probably began the practice of granting land to officers in lieu of salary.
• The maintenance of Public records was a characteristic feature of
Harshavardhan’s administration.
• The records of good as well as bad events that occurred during the the time
have been recorded in them.
Administration in Harshavardhana’s Reign
• Taxation was light and forced labour was also rare.
• One-sixth of the crop produce was collected as land tax.
• The king made frequent visits of inspection throughout his dominion.
• Harshavardhans Army consisted of four divisions- foot, chariot, horse and
elephant. It was much more than that of the Mauryans.
• There was provision of cruel punishments, similar to the Mauryan times.
• Harshavardhan had diplomatic relations with China.
Society during Harsha’s rule
• There was fourfold Varna system in place comprising- Brahmins, kshatriya, Vaishya,
and Sudra.
• Brahmins received land grants from the king, Kshatriyas were the ruling class,
Vaishyas were involved in trading and Sudras practiced agriculture. There were
many sub-castes.
• Position of Women: Women lost the privileges of Swayamvar(the choice of
choosing the husband), Widow remarriage was not permitted, especially among
higher castes. The practice of Dowry and Sati became prevalent.
• Burial of dead: dead were disposed either by cremation, water burial or exposure
in the woods.
Economy
• During Harshavardhana’s reign, trade and commerce declined, as depicted
by an decrease in trade centres.
• This decline also affected handicraft and agriculture.
• This also led to rise of self-sufficient village economy.
Developments in Art & Culture
• The architecture during Harsha’s period
was based on Gupta style primarily.
• Hiuen Tsang refers to a 8 feet tall copper
Buddha statue.
• He also talk of a multistory monastery at
Nalanda.
• In Chhattisgarh at Sirpur, a brick temple
of Lakshman is surviving example of
architecture during Harsh’a period.
Harsha’s death
Harsha died in 647 AD after ruling for 41 years.
Since he died without any heirs, his empire disintegrated
very soon after his death.
Vakataka Dynasty
• The Vakataka dynasty ruled parts of
South-Central India from 250 AD to
500 AD.
• They were important rulers whose
power was firmly established in the
Deccan just like their
contemporaries, the Guptas in the
north.

Heat
By Dr Vipan Goyal

WHAT IS HEAT?
• Heat is a form of energy.
• Heat is measured by the temperature effect which it produces.
When heat is given to a substance its temperature rises.
• Temperature is the degree of hotness of a substance. Temperature
is measured in the unit of degree Celsius or Kelvin(k).It is measured
in Joules(J).
• E.g: Makes a hot air balloon rise, Steam engines
JOULE’S LAW OF HEATING
H = I2 R t
• This is known as Joule’s law of heating. The law implies that heat
produced in a resistor is (i) directly proportional to the square of
current for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to resistance
for a given current, and (iii) directly proportional to the time for
which the current flows through the resistor.
• One Watt Hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of
power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric
energy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.
• 1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second
 = 3.6 × 106 Watt second
 = 3.6 × 106 joule (J)
• Heat can be converted to other forms of energy
SUNLIGHT
• It is used by plants for photosynthesis, it is converted to chemical
energy. Food is a type of chemical. It breaks down using chemical
reaction by two process - Anabolism(Building) and
Catabolism(Breaking).
• Oil and gas are burnt in power stations to produce heat energy, this
is used to turn turbines which in-turns produce electricity(electrical
energy)
Production Of Heat
• The movement of particles/
molecules produces heat
Particles move about more and
take up more room if heated –
this is why things expand if
heated while on cooling , the
particles moves closer and
shrink.
• It is also why substances change
form when heated
FORMS OF HEAT TRANSFER
Energy can be transferred by 3 types:
Conduction Convection Radiation
RADIATION
• The transfer of heat in rays, from a
hot objects, without needing a
medium to pass through.
• It travels in all directions from a hot
object. The hotter an object is, the
more heat it will radiate out.
• Radiation does not require any
medium for propagation and it
propagates without heating the
intervening medium.
• A dull black surface will radiate and absorb heat better than a bright shiny
surface.
• White reflects heat radiation and keeps the house cooler.
Black Body
• A body that absorbs the entire radiation incident on it is called perfectly
black body.
• Ratio of heat absorbed (radiation) to total incident radiation for a body is
called absorptive power (a) of body. It has no unit.
• Amount of heat radiation per unit area of the surface at a given
temperature is called emissive power of the surface.
• The ratio of emissive power and absorptive power of a body is always
same.
• It is equal to emissive power of a black body. This is known as Kirchhoff’s
law.
• White colour is a bad absorbers and good reflectors of heat radiations
while black colour is good absorbers and bad reflectors of heat.
• Therefore, clothes of light colours give better feeling in summer and
clothes of dark colours give better feeling in winter.
• Stefan’s Law
• It states that “The amount of heat energy (E) radiated per second by unit
area of perfectly black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of
absolute temperature (T) of the body.”
• E ∝ T4
• Good absorbers are good emitters and poor absorbers are poor emitters.
Transmission of Heat
• Heat can be transferred from one place to another by process of
transmission.
• There are three methods of transmission of heat.
CONDUCTION
• When you heat a metal strip at one end, the heat travels to the
other end.
• As you heat the metal, the particles vibrates, these vibrations make
the adjacent particles vibrate, and so on and so on, the vibrations
are passed along the metals and so is the heat. We call this
Conduction.
CONDUCTORS/INSULATORS
• If a substance easily allows to move through it, we can say it is a
good conductor of heat. E.g: most metals.
• If a substance does not allow heat to pass through we can say it is
an insulator. E.g: wood, plastic, glass.
• Why do many sauce pans have plastic handles? As it provides
insulation to heat.
• The mode of transmission of heat in solids from higher temperature
part to lower temperature part without actual movement of the
particles, is called conduction.
CONDUCTORS/INSULATORS
• Transmission of heat in solids takes place mainly through conduction.
• Metals are good conductors of heat. Wood, cotton, wool, glass are bad
conductors of heat, dry air is also a bad conductor of heat.
• Woollen clothes do not allow the heat of our body to escape and
therefore we feel warm.
• On a cold night two thin blankets give more warmth than a single thick
blanket because the layer of air between the two blankets works as a
better insulator.
• Refrigerators and ice-boxes have double walls having thermocole between
them which minimize heat gain by conduction.
CONVECTION
• It is the way in which particles in a gas or liquid
move upwards, carrying heat with them.
• When you boil water, the bubbles move upwards
• A gas heater in the room, the heat rises around
the room.
• The mode of transmission of heat in fluids (liquids
and gases) due to actual movement of the
particles, is called convection.
CONVECTION
• In liquids and gases, heat is transmitted by convection.
• When a liquid in a vessel is heated at the bottom, the liquid at bottom
gets heated and expands.
• Due to its lower density, hot liquid rises and its place is taken by cold liquid
from above. Convection currents are set up in the liquid until the
temperature of the whole liquid becomes same.
• The cooling unit in a refrigerator is fitted near the top as cold air move
downward and keeps cool the whole interior.
• Radiator in a motor car works on the principle of convection.
Newton’s Law of Cooling
• The rate of loss of heat from a body is directly proportional to the
difference in temperatures of the body and its surroundings.
• If we take hot water and fresh water and put it in a refrigerator, then rate
of cooling of hot water will be faster than the fresh tap-water.
• Sea Breeze During day time, the seashore warms up much faster than sea
water. Hot air over the seashore rises and cooler air from sea water moves
towards seashore to take its place resulting in a sea breeze.
• Land Breeze At night, land cools faster than sea water. Now hot air over
sea water rises and cooler air from land moves towards sea to take its
place and resulting in a land breeze.
Newton’s Law of Cooling
• Cloudy nights are warmer than clear night because clouds reflect
the radiations emitted by the earth at night and keep it warm.
• Relation between Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit:
Expansion and Contraction
• The reason materials expand when heated is because the heat gives
the molecules energy and as a result they begin to move, leaving
them further apart and hence the material expands.
• Cooling has the opposite effect, the particles move closer together
causing the molecules to contract.
Expansion and Contraction
Why are bottle not filled up to the top?
Because the materials expand when they heat up we need to leave
room for that.
Temperature
• Temperature is measure of hotness or coldness of a body.
• The heat flows from one body to another due to the difference in
their body temperature.
• Scale of Temperature
• To measure the temperature of a body following temperature
scales are used.
• Celsius scale of temperature freezing point is 0°C
• Boiling point of water is 100°C
Temperature
• Fahrenheit scale of temperature ice point or freezing of water = 32° F
• Boiling point of water = 212° F
• Kelvin or absolute scale of temperature ice point of water = 273° K
• Boiling point of water = 373° K
• Reaumur scale of temperature ice point of water is 0° R,
• Boiling point of water = 80°R
• Rankine scale of temperature ice point /freezing point of water = 491.67°R
Boiling point of water = 671.641° R
Relation between Different Scales of Temperature
• Different scales of temperature are related as follows:
• C/ 100 = F – 32/180 = R/ 80 = K – 273/100
• K =273+ °C
• At temperature – 40°C = – 40°F,
• Celsius scale is equal to Fahrenheit
• The temperature at which the three phases of water remains at
equilibrium is called triple point of water (273.16 K)
Thermometers
• The instruments used to measure temperature of a body is called
thermometer.
• Thermometers are of following three types
 1. Clinical thermometer It is used to measure human body
temperatures and ranges from 96° F to 110°F or 35°C to 43°C.
 2. Electronic thermometer Basic components of an electronic
thermometer are thermistors or thermo-resistors. Range of
electronic thermometer is –40° to 450°F.
Thermometers
 3. Other thermometers these include constant volume gas
thermometer, platinum resistance thermometer etc.
• Clinical thermometer measures temperature in degree fahrenheit (°F).
• In thermometer, mercury is commonly used through a wide range from –
30°C to 300°C.
• Gas thermometer : -268 to 1500 degree Celsius
• Platinum Thermometer : -200 to 1200 degree celsius
• Thermometer was developed by Galileo who found that the gases expand
on heating.
• Alcohal thermometer is better than mercury thermometer due to greater
expansion.
Reasons for using Mercury in Thermometer
• Mercury is opaque and therefore temperature can be read conveniently.
• Mercury is a good conductor of heat and therefore temperature rapidly.
• Mercury does not stick to glass and also does not vaporized and therefore
yield correct reading.
• Water cannot be used in thermometer because it is at 0 degree celsius
and also because of its irregular expansion.
• In some countries where winter temperature of -40C is uncommon,
mercury thermometers cannot be used because mercury freezes at -39C.
In such countries, alcohol thermometers are useful since alcohol freezes at
-112C
Thermal Expansion
• The expansion of a body caused by heat is known as thermal
expansion.
Thermal Expansion of Solids
Thermal expansion of solids is of three types
• 1. Expansion in length on heating is called linear expansion. The
increase in length of a rod of unit length of a substance due to
increase in its temperature by 1°C is called the coefficient of linear
expansion of the substance of that rod. It is represented by α.
Thermal Expansion
• linear expansion = Increase in length / Initial length × Rise in
temperature
• α = ΔL= L × Δt
• Its unit is °C–1.
• 2. Expansion in area on heating, is called superficial expansion.
Coefficient of superficial expansion is given as
• β = Increase in area/ Initial area × Rise in temperature = ΔA/ A × Δt
• Its unit is °C–1.
Thermal Expansion
• 3. Expansion in volume on heating, is called volume expansion or
cubical expansion.
• Coefficient of volume or cubical expansion is given as γ = Increase in
volume/ Original volume × Rise in temperature = ΔV/ V × Δt
• Its unit is °C-1
Relation between Coefficients of Expansions
• Coefficients of thermal expansions are related as
• β = 2α and γ = 3α and α : β : γ = 1 : 2 : 3
• In laying a railway line, a small gap is left in between two iron rails
otherwise railway line will become curved on heating in summer.
• Telephone wires are not tighten on poles because in winter, wires
get contract and can break.
Thermal Expansion of Liquids
• In liquids, only expansion in volume takes place on heating.
• Expansion of liquid is of two types:
 When expansion of the container, containing liquid, on heating, is not
taken into account, then observed expansion is called apparent
expansion of liquids.
 When expansion of the container, containing liquid, on heating, is also
taken into account, then observed expansion is called real expansion
of liquids. γr = γa + γg
• where, γr and γa, are coefficients of real and apparent expansion of liquids
and γg = coefficient of cubical expansion of the container.
Anomalous Expansion of Water
• When temperature of water is increased from 0°C, then its volume
decreases up to 4°C, becomes minimum at 4°C and then increases.
• This behavior of water expansion around 4°C is called, anomalous
expansion of water.
Thermal Expansion of Gases
• There are two types of coefficient of expansion in gases.
• At constant pressure, the change in volume per unit volume per
degree celsius is called volume coefficient (γv).
• At constant volume, the change in pressure per unit, pressure per
degree celsius, is called pressure coefficient (yp).
Calorimetry
• Amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water
by 1°C is called 1 calorie.
• Calorimetry states that heat lost by hotter body equals the heat
gained by colder body.
Specific Heat
• The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass
(m) of a substance through 1°C, is called its specific heat (s).
• It is denoted by s and its unit is ‘cal/g°C or Joule/g°/C.
• The specific heat of water is 4200 J/kg1/°C or 1000cal/ g1/° C,
which is high compared with most other substances.
• Therefore, water is used as coolant in radiator in vehicle and hot
water is used for the fermentation.
Specific Heat
• Heat energy given or taken to change the temperature of a body is
given by Q = msΔθ
• Where, m = mass of the body and Δθ = change in temperature.
• The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 mole of
a gas by 1°C is called molar specific heat.
Latent Heat
• The heat energy absorbed or released at constant temperature per
unit mass for change of state, is called latent heat.
• It is denoted by L and its SI unit is cal/g or kcal/kg.
• Heat energy absorbed or released during change of state is given by
Q = mL
• where, m = mass of the substance.
• Latent heat of fusion of ice is 80 cal/g.
• Latent heat of vaporisation of steam is 536 cal/g.
Thermodynamics
• The branch of physics which deals with the study of relation of heat energy with
different types of energy is called thermodynamics.
• Zeroth Law: Zeroth law of thermodynamics tells about thermal equilibrium.
• First Law
 As per first law about energy, heat given to a substance is equal to sum of
change in internal energy and work done.
 Adiabatic process : if the changes are taking place in a system in such a way
that there is no exchange of heat energy between the system and the
surrounding, then he process is called adiabatic process.
 Example : if CO2 is suddenly expanded, it is changed into dry ice. This is an
example of adiabatic process.
Thermodynamics
• Isothermal process : if the changes are taking place in a system in such a way that
temperature of the system remains constant throughout the change, then the
process is said to be isothermal.
• Second Law
 In second law work can be converted into heat and vice-versa but conversion
is not possible with 100% efficiency.
 It is impossible for a machine operating in a cyclic process to convert heat
completely into work, it is kelvin’s statement.
 Heat by itself can not transfer from a colder to a hotter body. It is clausius
statement. Refrigerator is based on this statement.
Thermodynamics
 Heat engine is a device which converts heat into mechanical work.
Internal combustion and external combustion heat engine are two
types of heat engine.
 Car engine uses coolant added with water to reduce harmful effects
like corrosion, rusting etc. Such as ethylene glycol, Potassium
dichromate etc,
 Carnot’s theorem tells about maximum efficiency of heat engine. It
refers to Carnot cycle.
Thermodynamics
• Entropy measures the molecular disorder of a system and is a
thermodynamic function depending only on the temperature of the
system.
• Evaporation is a process in which molecules escape slowly from the
surface of a liquid.
• For a given liquid the rate of evaporation demands on the temperature
and area of evaporating surface.
• Refrigerator is a device used for cooling things by the evaporation and
compression of a volatile liquid inside a copper coil.
• Evaporation causes cooling. Examples :
• In summer season, water is stored in pitcher.
• Evaporation of ether at room temperature at room temperature leads
cooling.
• Water evaporating from the wet cloth produces cooling and brings the
temperature down.
• A desert cooler produces cooling by evaporation.
• Hot water burns are less severe than that of steam burns because steam
has high latent heat.
• Ice at zero degree Celsius appears colder than that water at zero degree
Celsius.
• Out of all substances, hydrogen has maximum specific heat.
• Triple point of water : The temperature at which all the three phases of
water i.e. solid, liquid and gas are in equilibrium with one another. It is
assigned by value of temperature 273.16 Kelvin.
Change of state
• Fusion : The process by which a substance is changed from solid state to liquid state
is called fusion.
• Fusion takes place at a fixed temperature called melting point.
• To convert a liquid to a solid we cool it below its freezing point. This process is
known as ‘Freezing’.
• For a substance M.P. = F.P.
• Melting point of a substance changes with change in pressure.
• Melting point of substances which contracts in the process of fusion (as ice)
decreases with increase in pressure.
• Melting point of substances which expands in the process of fusion (wax) increases
with increase in pressure.
• With the addition of impurity ( as salt in ice ), melting point of a substance
decreases.
• Vaporization: To convert liquids into gas you need to heat the liquid beyond its
boiling point or (liquid to vapor state)
• Boiling : the process of vaporization which takes place at a fixed temperature and
whole part of the liquid is called boiling.
• The temperature at which boiling takes place is called boiling point.
• Condensation : Process by which a substance is changed from vapor to liquid state
is called condensation.
• Boiling point of a liquid increases with increase in pressure.
• Boiling point of a liquid increases with addition of impurity.
• Latent Heat
• When the change of state occurs the temperature of a substance remains
constant during a change in the state.
• As if the change in state opens up new portals or spaces where our
supplied energy hides.
• Therefore we call this hidden energy, the latent or the hidden heat.
• Suppose we have a block of ice we want to convert to water. We all know
that ice turns to water and vice versa at 0°C. Now assume we start heating
ice at 0°C. You will observe that when we do so, the temperature of ice
does not change. It starts converting to water but the temperature does
not rise until the entire ice block has been converted to water.
• If a mass ‘m’ of any substance undergoes a change in state by absorbing an
amount of heat, Q at a constant Temperature T, then we have:
• L = Q/m or Q = mL
• All the heat supplied to the ice at 0
0C is used by the ice to change its phase from
solid to liquid. Thus the heat supplied is not used up to raise the temperature of
the substance.
• Latent Heat of Fusion
• The heat energy supplied per unit mass of a substance at its melting point to
convert the state of the substance from solid to liquid is known as Latent heat of
Fusion. Latent heat of Fusion of water is 334 Joules/gram of water.
• Latent Heat of Vaporization
• The heat that a substance absorbs per unit mass at its boiling point to convert the
phase of the substance from liquid to gas is the Latent heat of Vaporization. Latent
heat of Vaporization of water is 2230 Joules/gram of water.
• Sublimation
• The process in which a solid changes directly to a gas is called sublimation.
It occurs when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely
overcome the force of attraction between them. Dry ice (solid carbon
dioxide, CO2
) is an example of a solid that undergoes sublimation.
• Hoar frost
• Reverse process of sublimation.
• Steam produces more severe burn than that at same temperature
because internal energy of steam is more than that of water at same
temperature.
Humidity
• The presence of moisture in the atmosphere is called humidity.
• The amount of water vapour present in the unit volume of
atmosphere is called absolute humidity.
• The relative humidity of air at a given temperature is the ratio of
mass of water vapour present in a certain volume of air to the mass
of water vapour required to saturate the same volume of air at the
same temperature, multiplied by 100.
• Relative humidity is measured by hygrometer.
Humidity
• Relative humidity of about 50% is considered comfortable at
temperature 22° – 25° C.
• If the relative humidity is very low in air, then lips become dry and
cracks appear in them.
• If relative humidity is very high in air then the sweat from our body
does not evaporate readily and therefore we feel uncomfortable.
• Air conditioning provides comfortable conditions by regulating
temperature and humidity.
• Hoar Frost-is the reverse process of sublimation.
MEASUREMENT UNITS
• Angstrom: For measuring length of light waves
• Barrel: For measuring liquids. One barrel is equal to 31½ gallons or
7,326.5 cubic inches
• Cable: For measuring length of cables. It is about 183m. in length

equal to 4 inches
• Knot: For measuring speed of ships

POWER AND FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH COURT
The jurisdiction and powers of the High Court can be classified into the
following:
1. Original Jurisdiction.
2. Writ Jurisdiction.
3. Appellate Jurisdiction.
4. Supervisory Jurisdiction.
5. Control over Subordinate courts
6. A Court of Record.
7. Power of Judicial Review.
©StudyIQ Education
1. Original Jurisdiction
It means the power of a high court to hear disputes in the first instance, not by way
of appeal.
It extends to the following:
(a)Matters of admirality, will, marriage, divorce, company laws and contempt of
court.
(b) Disputes in election of MPs and MLAs
(c) revenue matters.
(d) Enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens.
(e) Cases ordered to be transferred from a subordinate court involving the
interpretation of the Constitution to its own file.
©StudyIQ Education
2. Writ Jurisdiction
• Article 226 - Habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition and quo warranto
• for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of the citizens and for any other
purpose.
• The phrase ‘for any other purpose’ refers to the enforcement of an ordinary legal
right.
• Writ jurisdiction of the high court is wider than that of the Supreme Court –
 SC WRITS = Only FR
 HC WRITS = FR + ordinary legal rights
©StudyIQ Education
3. Appellate Jurisdiction
• A high court is primarily a court of appeal.
• It hears appeals against the judgements of subordinate courts functioning in
its territorial jurisdiction.
• It has appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters.
• Hence, the appellate jurisdiction of a high court is wider than its original
jurisdiction.
©StudyIQ Education
4. Supervisory Jurisdiction
A high court has the power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals
functioning in its territorial jurisdiction (except military courts or tribunals).
5. Control over Subordinate Courts
A high court has an administrative control and other powers over them.
(a) It is consulted by the governor in the matters of appointment, posting and
promotion of district judges + appointments to the judicial service
(b) It deals with the matters of posting, promotion, grant of leave, transfers and
discipline of the members of the judicial service of the state (other than district
judges).
6. A Court of Record
©StudyIQ Education
7. Power of Judicial Review
Power of the High Court to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments
and executive orders of both the central and state governments.
• The High Court has the power to review its own judgment or order.
NOTE -
Judicial review not mentioned directly in const. Art 13 and 226 give HC this power
©StudyIQ Education
• The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 - curtailed the judicial review power of
high court.
 High courts could not consider the constitutional validity of any central
law.
©StudyIQ Education
MISCELLANEOUS:
• High Court is the highest Court of appeal in the state.
• The High Court is the protector of Fundamental Rights of the citizens.
• The High Courts are vested with the power to interpret the Constitution but
the final interpreter is the Supreme Court.
• In the absence of the CJ the President can appoint a judge of a High Court as
an acting Chief Justice of the High Court.
• The CJ can request a retired judge of that High Court or any High Court to act
as a judge of the High Court for a temporary period of time.

History of the Working Class
Movement in British India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

History of the working class
movement in British India
• The early nationalist advocated the improvement of economic conditions
of the working classes.
• In 1870, Sasipada Banerjee started a Working Man’s Club and
newspaper ‘Bharat Shramjeevi’.
• In 1878, Sorabjee Shapoorji Bengalee drafted a bill for providing better
working conditions to the labourers and tried to pass in the Bombay
Legislative Council.
• In 1880, the Bombay Mill and Millhands Association was set up by Narain
Meghajee Lokhanday. He also started newspaper ‘Deenbandhu’.
• In 1899, first strike took place in the Indian Peninsula Railways.
• Tilak’s newspaper i.e. Kesari and Maharatta supported the strike and
launched the campaign for months.
• During Swadeshi Movement, Indian working classes came with wider
political issues.
• Ashwini Coomar Banerjee, Prabhat Kumar Roy Chaudhari, Premtosh
Bose and Apurba Kumar Ghosh organised mass level strikes in the
government press, railways and the jute industries.
• The biggest strike was organised when Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested
and faced trial.
Formation of Trade Union:
• On October 31, 1920, All India Trade Union Congress was founded.
• Lala Lajpat Rai was then became the first president and Dewan
Chaman Lal was the first general secretary.
• Lala Lajpat Rai was the first person who linked capitalism with
imperialism and gave the statement, ‘Imperialism and militarism
are the twin children of capitalism’.
• CR Das, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, CF Andrews, JM
Sengupta, Satyamurthy, VV Giri and Sarojini Naidu supported the
formation of trade union.
• In 1918, the trade Union has emerged as a pressure group in a capitalist society
because during this year Gandhi helped to organise the Ahmedabad Textile
Labour Association and their demand in wage hike which was arbitrated 35
percent instead of 27.5 percent.
• In 1926, British government came with the trade union Act to formalize the trade
union as a legal association.
• It also laid down eligibility criteria for registration and regulation of trade union
activities.
• This act not only secured the immunity for both civil and criminal from prosecution
for the legitimate activities of the trade union act but also imposed restrictions on
their political activities.
• In 1928 during Bombay Textile Mills, strike led by Girni Kamgar Union changed the
picture of Trade union politics due to the emergence of Communist.
• SA Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, PC Joshi and Sohan Singh Joshi were the famous
trade union leaders of that time.
• This strike was an alarming situation for the British government that laid the
formation of the Public Safety Ordinance of 1929 and the Trade Disputes Act of
1929.
• These acts made compulsory to the appointment of courts of Inquiry and
Consultation Boards for settling industrial disputes.
• It also made strike in public utility services like posts, railways, water and electricity
as an illegal action unless working class union prior notified to the administration a
month before.
• Meerut Conspiracy Case of 1929: The British arrested 31 labour leaders and trial
of three and a half year resulted in the conviction of working class leaders
like Muzaffar Ahmed, SA Dange, Joglekar, Philip Spratt, Ben Bradley and
Shaukat Usmani.
• This case and trial received worldwide publicity, but weakened the working class
movement in India.
• After 1930, the working class union of India fractioned as the communist
approach of trade union and corporatist approach.
• NM Joshi set up All India Trade Union Federation in 1931.
• In 1935, All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was reaffirmed by communists,
congress socialist and leftist nationalists like JL Nehru and Subhas Chandra
Bose.
• Impact of Second World War: Initially, working class opposed the war
when Russia joined the war on the behalf of the allies supported by the
working class.
• In 1945, dock workers of Bombay (now Mumbai) and Calcutta (now
Kolkata) refused to load ships taking supplies to the warring troops in
Indonesia.
Above historical timeline reflects that their main motive was to improve a low
wage situation, long working hours, unhygienic and hazardous working
conditions, child labour and improvement in basic amenities.

• First Factory Act, 1881
 Commission for this purpose was constituted in 1874.

Lord Morley - Secretary of State for India (in London)
Lord Minto II - Viceroy of India (in Calcutta)
Background –
 Rising extremism – not good for British rule
 Hence they wanted to give concession to Moderate demands while
cracking down on extremism
 They also wanted to further the divide and rule policy via Separate
electorate
 Curzon’s imperialist approach and policies had left the Indians
resentful
 In 1906, a group of Muslim elites called the Shimla deputation, led by
the Agha Khan, met Lord Minto & demanded separate electorates for
the Muslims.
. The principle of election to the councils was legally recognized. But
communal representation was for the first time introduced in the
interests of Muslims. Separate electorates were provided for the
Muslims
 The electorate was decided on the basis of CLASS AND
COMMUNITY.
 12 December,1911
 In honour of King George V & Queen Mary
 Only Durbar where the British Monarch actually attended
 Lord Hardinge made announcements :
Annulement of Partition of Bengal (but new divisions based on language )
Shifting of capital from Calcutta to Delhi (done on 12/12/1912)
*Shimla was the summer capital since 1863

Important events during his term
 Transfer of capital from Calcutta to Delhi (1911).
 Coronation durbar of King George V held in Delhi (1911)
 Annulment of Bengal Partition.
 Establishment of the Hindu Mahasabha (1915) by Madan Mohan
Malaviya and others
 In 1916, Lord Hardinge laid the foundation of the Banaras Hindu
University.
(Madan Mohan Malaviya was the Founder-Chancellor of this university)
Lord Hardinge Bombing case
 23 Dec 1912 – Viceroy was entering the new capital of Delhi in a
procession from Chandni chowk to New Delhi
 A bomb was thrown on his carriage bt it missed the mark – viceroy
escaped unhurt
 Sachindranath Sanyal and Ras Bihari Bose - escaped
 In the First World War (1914-1919), Britain allied with France, Russia, USA,
Italy and Japan against Germany, Austria, Hungary and Turkey.
 The nationalist response to British participation in the War was three-fold :
1. The Moderates supported the empire in the War as a matter of duty
2. The extremists, including Tilak (who was released in June 1914),
supported the war efforts in the mistaken belief that Britain would repay
India’s loyalty with gratitude in the form of self-government;
3. The revolutionaries decided to utilize the opportunity to wage a war and
liberate the country
 1.3 million Indian soldiers served under the British army in the great
war
 ~50,000 laid down their lives for the British Empire
 India gate, New Delhi - war memorial
 The Home Rule Movement was the Indian response to the First World
War
 Annie Besant, the Irish theosophist, had decided of a movement for
Home Rule on the lines of the Irish Home Rule Leagues
 Tilak was ready to assume leadership after his release in 1914, and
reassured Government of his loyalty and to the Moderates that he, like
the Irish Home Rulers, wanted a reform of the administration and not
the overthrow of the British Government in India.
 The home rule league mainly aimed at
 Getting self-government for India within the British Empire
 Formation of linguistic based states
 Education in the vernacular Languages
Two Home Rule Leagues were established (not simultaneously) by -
1. B G Tilak at Poona in April 1916
2. Annie Besant at Madras in September 1916
 Tilak’s Movement concentrated on Maharashtra ,Karnataka, Central
Provinces and Berar
 Annie Besant’s Movement covered the rest of India
Newspapers :
Maratha and Kesari - BG Tilak
New India and Commonweal - Annie Besant
*Shyamji Krishna Verma,Bhikaji Cama set up an Indian Home rule
Society in London in 1905
*Lala Lajpat Rai started the Indian Home Rule League of America in New
York in 1917 (Publication – Young India)
 The two Leagues cooperated with each other as well with the Congress
and the Muslim League in putting their demand for home rule.
 The Home Rule Movement had brought a new life in the national
movement (Revival of Swadeshi movement) with women joining in
larger numbers.
 It worked round the year , unlike INC
*Who did not Join this movement ?
 Anglo-Indians
 Most of the Muslims (Jinnah was a core leader of the League though)
 Non-Brahmins from South
They all felt Home Rule would mean rule of the Hindu majority, mainly
the higher caste Hindus
 The Government came down with severe repression, especially in
Madras where the students were prohibited from attending political
meetings.
 Tilak was barred from entering in Punjab & Delhi.
 In 1917, Annie Besant & her associates were arrested which invited
nationwide protests (G.Subramaniya Aiyar renounced his knighthood)
 Government decided to placate the nationalists by declaring its
intention to grant self-government to Indians, as contained in
Montagu’s August 1917 declaration.
 Montagu promised the gradual development of self-governing
institutions in India. (‘’A responsible govt.’’)
 This August Declaration led to the end of the Home Rule Movement.
 Tilak’s and Besant’s efforts in the Moderate-Extremist reunion at
Lucknow (1916) revived the Congress as an effective instrument of
Indian nationalism.
 INC factions united = Moderate + Extremist united
 INC President - Ambica Charan Mazumdar
 An understanding for joint action against the British was reached
between the Congress and Muslim League and it was called the
Lucknow Pact
 Marked an important step in the Hindu-Muslim unity.
 INC accepted separate electorates (1909) of Muslims for the first time

Important Development Indexes
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Human Development Index (HDI)
• The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistics of
life expectancy, education, and income indices to rank countries
into four tiers of human development.
• It was created by economist Mahbub-ul-Haq, followed by
economist Amartya Sen in 1990, and published by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
• In its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a
new method of calculating the HDI.
Human Development Index (HDI)
• The following three indices are used:
1. Life Expectancy Index
2. Education Index: It includes
a. Mean Years of Schooling Index
b. Expected Years of Schooling Index
3. Income Index
Computing the HDI
• To construct the Index, fixed minimum and maximum values have
been established for each of the indicators:
i. Life expectancy at birth: 25 years and 85 years.
ii. General literacy rate: 0 per cent and 100 per cent.
iii. Real GDP per capita (PPP$); PPP$ 100 and PPP$ 40,000.
Inequality-adjusted HDI
• The 2010 Human Development Report was the first to calculate an Inequalityadjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).
• The HDI represents a national average of human development achievements in the
three basic dimensions making up the HDI: Health, education and income.
• Like all averages, it conceals disparities in human development across the
population within the same country.
• Two countries with different distributions of achievements can have the same
average HDI value.
• The HDI takes into account not only the average achievements of a country on
health, education and income, but also how those achievements are distributed
among its citizens by “discounting” each dimension’s average value according to its
level of inequality.
• 14 September 2018 – India climbed one spot to 130 out of 189 countries in the latest
human development rankings released today by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP).
• India’s HDI value for 2017 is 0.640, which put the country in the medium human
development category. Between 1990 and 2017, India’s HDI value incased from 0.427
to 0.640, an increase of nearly 50 percent – and an indicator of the country’s
remarkable achievement in lifting millions of people out of poverty.
• Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland and Germany lead the ranking, while Niger, the
Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi have the lowest scores in the
HDI’s measurement of national achievements in health, education and income.
• Within South Asia, India’s HDI value is above the average of 0.638 for the region, with
Bangladesh and Pakistan, countries with similar population size, being ranked 136 and
150 respectively.
Gender Inequality Index
• The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is a new index that was
introduced in the 2010 Human Development Report’s 20th
anniversary edition by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) for the measurement of gender disparity.
• According to the UNDP, this index is a composite measure which
captures the loss of achievement within a country due to gender
inequality and uses three dimensions to do so: (i) Reproductive
health, (ii) Empowerment, and (iii) Labour market participation.
Gender Inequality Index
• The new index was introduced as an experimental measure to rectify the
shortcomings of the previous, and no longer used indicators, the Gender
Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM),
both of which were introduced in the 1995 Human Development Report.
• The GII's dimension of reproductive health has two indicators: (i) The
Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) and (ii) The Adolescent Fertility Rate
(AFR)
• The empowerment dimension is measured by two indicators: (i) The share
of parliamentary seats held by each sex and (ii) Higher education
attainment levels
Gender Inequality Index
• The labour market dimension is measured by women's participation
in the workforce. This dimension accounts for paid work, unpaid
work, and actively looking for work. According to the Human
Development Report 2011, India ranks 129 out of 146 countries on
the Gender Inequality Index, below Bangladesh and Pakistan,
which are ranked at 112 and 115, respectively
• Among BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) nations,
India has the highest inequalities in human development
Multidimensional Poverty Index
• The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) was developed in 2010
by Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative and the United
Nations Development Programme and uses different factors to
determine poverty beyond income-based lists. It replaced the
previous Human Poverty Index.
• The MPI is an index of acute multidimensional poverty. It shows the
number of people who are multidimensionality poor (suffering
deprivations in 33.33% of weighted indicators) and the number of
deprivations with which poor households typically contend.
Multidimensional Poverty Index
• It reflects deprivations in very
rudimentary services and core
human functioning for people.
• The index uses the same three
dimensions as the Human
Development Index: (i) Health,
(ii) Education, and (iii) Standard
of living. These are measured
using 10 indicators.
Dimensions Indicators
Health  Child Mortality
 Nutrition
Education  Years of school
 Children enrolled
Living Standards  Cooking fuel
 Toilet
 Water
 Electricity
 Floor
 Assets
Technological Achievement Index (TAI)
• The Technology Achievement Index (TAI) is used by the UNDP
(United Nations Development Programme) to measure how well a
country is creating and diffusing technology and building a human
skill base, reflecting capacity to participate in the technological
innovations of the network age.
• The TAI focuses on four dimensions of technological capacity: (i)
Creation of technology, (ii) Diffusion of recent innovations, (iii)
Diffusion of old innovations, and (iv) Human skills.
Technological Achievement Index (TAI)
• Technology creation: Measured by the number of patents granted to
residents per capita and by receipts of royalties and license fees from
abroad per capita
• Diffusion of recent innovations: Measured by the number of Internet
hosts per capita and the share of high-technology and medium-technology
exports in total goods exported
• Diffusion of old innovations: Measured by telephones (mainline and
cellular) per capita and electricity consumption per capita
• Human skills: Measured by the mean years of schooling in the population
aged 15 and older and the gross tertiary science enrolment ratio
Sustainable Development
• The term Sustainable Development was used by the Brundtland
Commission which has become the most often-quoted definition of
Sustainable Development: "Development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs".
• Sustainable Development ties together concern for the carrying capacity
of natural systems with the social challenges faced by humanity. As early
as the 1970s, "sustainability" was employed to describe an economy "in
equilibrium with basic ecological support systems". Ecologists have
pointed to The Limits to Growth.
Sustainable Development
• The concept of Sustainable Development has in the past most often been
broken into three constituent parts: Environmental sustainability,
Economic Sustainability and sociopolitical Sustainability.
• Green Development is generally differentiated from Sustainable
Development in that Green development prioritizes what its proponents
consider to be environmental sustainability over economic and cultural
considerations.
• Proponents of Sustainable Development argue that it provides a context
to improve overall sustainability where cutting edge Green Development is
unattainable.
Sustainable Development
• Inclusive green growth is the pathway to Sustainable Development.
• It is the only way to reconcile the rapid growth required to bring
developing countries to the level of prosperity which they aspire, meet the
needs of the more than nearly 1 billion people still living in poverty, and
fulfill the imperative requirement of a better Global Environment.
• Three Pillars of Sustainability
 The three pillars of sustainability are a powerful tool for defining the
Sustainable Development problem. This consists of three parameters:
Economic, Social, and Environmental pillars. If any one pillar is weak
then the system as a whole is unsustainable.
Importance of Sustainable Development
• Social Sustainability
 Social Sustainability is the ability of a social system, such as a
country, family, or organization, to function at a defined level of
social well-being and harmony indefinitely.
 Problems like war, endemic poverty, widespread injustice, and
low education rate are symptoms of a system that is socially
unsustainable.
Importance of Sustainable Development
• Environmental Sustainability
 Environmental Sustainability is the ability of the environment to
support a defined level of environmental quality and natural
resource extraction rates indefinitely.
 This is the world's biggest actual problem, though, since the
consequences of not solving the problem now are delayed, the
problem receives too low a priority to be solved.
Importance of Sustainable Development
• Economic Sustainability
 Economic Sustainability is the ability of an economy to support a
defined level of economic production indefinitely.
 Since the Great Recession of 2008 this is the world's biggest
apparent problem which endangers progress due to
environmental sustainability problem.

Civil Services Policy of British
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Indian Civil Service
• The term 'Civil Service' refers to the administrative machinery
of the state which is responsible for implementing policies
made by the political executive, which constitutes of the
elected representatives in a democracy.
Evolution of Civil Services in India
The Indian state had some form of civil service since the ancient
past
• Mauryan Empire had a centralized bureaucracy which was
responsible for tax administration, as mentioned in Kautilya's
Arthashastra.
• Such a governing machinery existed under Gupta period as well
• The Mughals had created an elaborate bureaucracy known as
the Mansabdari system which ranked officers based on number
of troops they commanded.
Evolution of Civil Services in India
 Until the rule of East India Company, there was no clear
demarcation between civilian officials and military officials.
Also, payment of salaries to these officials varied from cash
payments to in-kind payments such as land grants.
 The British had systematized civil services in India by
distinguishing it from the military services, creating a
hierarchy of officials who are paid out of public revenues.
Civil Service under the Company's Rule
• Need for the civil service was felt soon after the Company acquired
territories after the Battles of Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764).
• Warren Hastings, the then Governor-General of Bengal had created the
post of District Collector who was made in-charge of collecting land
revenue.
• This post was soon abolished on grounds of excessive concentration of
powers and corruption.
Civil Service under the Company's Rule
• Lord Cornwallis is usually known as the Father of civil services in India. He had
introduced the Covenanted Civil Services and the Uncovenanted Civil Services.
• The Covenanted Civil Services was created out of the Law of the Company. It
was the higher civil services and comprised, almost exclusively, of Europeans
who were paid very high salaries.
• The Uncovenanted Civil Services were the lower civil services and comprised
mostly of native-born Indians, and to some extent, Europeans too. They were
not paid as high as the Covenanted Civil Services.
• Charter Act of 1833, provided that no Indian subject be barred from holding
any office under the company. This however did not alter the structure of
British bureaucracy
Civil Service under the Company's Rule
• Until 1853, the Court of Directors had exclusive right to appoint persons in
the Company's civil services.
• These appointments were a source of privilege and patronage which the
Company held on to very tightly.
• The Charter Act of 1853 provided for an open competitive examination for
recruitment of civil servants and had deprived the Court of Directors of
the power of appointments based on patronage.
• This was recommended by a committee headed by Lord Macaulay. First
competitive exam was held in 1855.
Civil Service under the Crown's Rule:
After 1857's revolt
• After the Government of India Act of 1858, the higher civil service in India
came to be known as the Indian Civil Services (ICS).
• The Indian Civil Services Act of 1861 provided that certain posts under the
Government of India were to be reserved for persons who had been a
resident of India for 7 years or more.
• This paved the way for the entry of Indians into the higher civil services.
• The Indian Civil Services Act of 1870 carried the process of Indianization of
civil services forward.
• Satyendranath Tagore was the first Indian to get selected in the Indian Civil
Services.
Civil Service under the Crown's Rule:
After 1857's revolt
• Aitchison Committee was appointed by Lord Dufferin to recommend
changes in the civil services.
• The Committee recommended that the Covenanted and Uncovenanted
Civil Services should be changed into Imperial, Provincial, and Subordinate
civil services.
• ICS came to be regarded as the steel frame of the British rule in India i.e. it
provided the support for maintaining control over the vast territories of
the British Empire.
Civil Service under the Crown's Rule:
After 1857's revolt
• With the August Declaration of 1917 by Edwin Montague in the House of
Commons, which had promised an increase in the association of Indians in
the administration.
• The proportion of Indians in the civil services began to increase
significantly and by 1930s Indians were in majority in the civil services.
• By 1934, there were seven All India Services including the Indian Forest
Service, Indian Police, Indian Political Service etc.
Characteristics of Civil Services at the time
• It reflected the deep-seated racial prejudice among British against Indians
• Almost all the higher level posts were reserved for Europeans.
• Only the low paid jobs were open for Indians.
• The recruitment process involved examinations that were held in London
and involved knowledge of subjects (Greek, Latin, English) alien to Indian
natives, as a result Indian representation in the Services was negligible.
• In 1860, the maximum age limit was lowered from 23 years to 22 years.
This was further lowered to 21 years in 1866.
Post-Independence Civil Service
Development
• Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was among the top nationalist leaders who had
argued for the continuation of the civil services because he had believed
that an organized bureaucracy was essential to ensure the unity and
integrity of the newly independent India.
• He had also stressed the need for having All India Services such as the IAS,
IPS, and IFoS to ensure uniformity in the administrative system throughout
the country. This was essential for national unity.
Regulations and Legislation Relating
to the Services - Through Time
• Recruitment to the civil service was made based on open competitive
examination after the passage of Charter Act, 1853.
• Aitchison Commission had recommended that the minimum and
maximum age limits to appear for the exam were to be 19 and 23
respectively.
• Viscount Lee Commission, set up in 1923, had recommended the creation
of a public service commission for the purpose of conducting
examinations to recruit the civil servants.
• Accordingly, a public service commission was set up in 1926.
Regulations and Legislation Relating
to the Services - Through Time
• The Government of India Act, 1935 enlarged the powers of the
commission and made it a Federal Public Service Commission.
• After independence, it became the Union Public Service Commission, with
constitutional status since 1950.
• UPSC is empowered to conduct the civil services examination for the
purpose of selecting and recommending the candidates to be appointed
as civil servants.

 Indian National Army
 The idea of the Indian National Army (INA) was first conceived in Malaya by Mohan
Singh, an Indian officer of the British Indian Army, when he decided not to join the
retreating British Army and instead turned to the Japanese for help.
 The Japanese handed over the Indian prisoners of war (POWs) to Mohan Singh who
tried to recruit them into an Indian National Army.
 Rash Behari Bose
 In 1942, After the fall of Singapore, Mohan Singh further got 45,000 POWs into his
sphere of influence.
 2 July 1943, Subhash Chandra Bose reached Singapore and gave the rousing war cry of
‘Dilli Chalo’


 Bose was made the President of Indian Independence League and soon became the
supreme commander of the Indian National Army
 Here he gave the slogan of Jai Hind.
 INA’s three Brigades were the Subhas Brigade, Gandhi Brigade and Nehru Brigade.
 The women’s wing of the army was named after Rani Laxmibai. (Capt.Laxmi Sehgal)
 INA marched towards Imphal after registering its victory over Kohima but after
Japan’s surrender in 1945, INA failed in its efforts.
 Under such circumstances, Subhash went to Taiwan & further on his way to
Tokyo he died on 18 August 1945 in a plane crash.
 Trial of the soldiers of INA was held at Red Fort in Delhi.
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Kailash Nath Katju, Asaf Ali and
Tej Bahadur Sapru fought the case on behalf of the soldiers.

Indus Valley
Civilization
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Introduction
• Indus Valley Civilization was the
first major civilization in
South Asia, which spread across a
vast area of land in present-day
India and Pakistan (around 12 lakh
sq.km).
• The Indus Valley Civilization was
established around 3300 BC. It
flourished between 2700 BC and
1900 BC (Mature Indus Valley
Civilization).
• It started declining around 1900 BC
and disappeared around 1400 BC.
Features of Indus Valley Civilization
• The most accepted period : 2500-1750 ( by CarbonDating)
• John Marshall was the ist scholar to use the term Indus Civilisation.
• Indus Civilization belongs to Proto-History period ( Chalcolithic
age/Bronze Age)
• This is also called Harappan Civilization after the first city to be
excavated, Harappa (Punjab, Pakistan).
• Pre-Harappan civilization has been found at Mehrgarh, Pakistan
which shows the first evidence of cotton cultivation
Geographical Stretch
• Geographically, this civilization covered
Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, Rajasthan,
Gujarat and Western Uttar Pradesh. It
extended from Sutkagengor (in
Baluchistan) in the West to Alamgirpur
(Western UP) in the East; and from
Manda (Jammu) in the North to
Daimabad (Ahmednagar, Maharashtra)
in the South.
• Some Indus Valley sites have also been
found in as far away as Afghanistan and
Turkmenistan

Geographical Stretch
• The total geographical stretch of Harappan
civilization is about 1,250,000 sq. km which is more
than 20 times of the area of Egyptian and more than
12 times of the combined area of Egyptian and
Mesopotamian civilizations.
Geographical Stretch
• Large cities settlements such as:
 Mohenjo Daro (+250 hectares), Pak
 Harappa (+150 hectares), Pak
 Kalibangan (+100 hectares), Rajasthan
 Dholavira (+100 hectares), Gujarat
 Ganawariwala (+80 hectares), Pak
 Rakhigarhi (+80 hectares), Hisar, Haryana
Geographical Area
• Large cities were surrounded by vast agricultural lands, rivers, and
forest that were inhabited by scattered farming and pastoral
communities and bands of hunters and food-gatherers.
• Excavations at the sites of Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, Kalibangan,
Lothal, Surkotada, Dholavira, etc. have given us a fair idea about the
various aspects such as town planning, economy, technology,
religion, etc. of this civilization.
• Capital cities : Harappa, Mohenjodaro
• Port Cities : Lothal , Sutkagendor, Balakot etc.
Characteristics of Indus Valley Civilization
• The orientation of streets and buildings,
according to the cardinal directions eastwest, and north-south was the
distinguishing factor of the IndusSaraswati cities.
• Harappan city sites, including Mohenjo
Daro, Harappa, Kalibangan, and
Surkotada were having large gateways at
various entry points of the city. These
gateways are seen even in the inner
fortification areas also.
Great Bath of Mohenjo Daro
• The Great Bath of Mohenjo
Daro is the most
remarkable feature of any
Harappan site
• The Great Bath was a brick
structure, which measured
12 m X 7 m and is nearly 3
m deep from the
surrounding pavement.
Great Bath of Mohenjo Daro
• The bath was linked with some sort of
ritual bathing, which was very common in
Indian life right from the ancient times to
till date.
• Immediately to the west of the Great
Bath (at Mohenjo Daro) was a group of
blocks of brickwork crisscrossed by
narrow lanes. These structures have been
identified as granaries, which were used
for storing grains.
• Similar structures have been also found
at Harappa, Kalibangan, and Lothal.
DOCKYARD
• The dockyard found at Lothal was
another important structure. It
was a large structure provided
with an inlet channel in the
eastern wall and a spillway.
• The inlet channel was connected
to a river. This was a dockyard
where ships and boats used to
come for loading and unloading
of trading goods.
• Lothal was a major trading center
of the Harappan civilization.
Streets and Drains
• The most outstanding features of
the Harappan civilization were the
streets and side lanes equipped
with drains system.
• The streets cut each other on the
right angles.
• This indicates that people had a
great civic sense of sanitation and
care for health and hygiene.
• Burnt bricks were used to make
drains.
Harappan Crafts & Industries
The Harappan civilization is referred to as a Bronze Age civilization. (Copper + Tin)
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
Citadel/Acropolis at cities for member of ruling class & brick houses below citadel in town for commoners
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
• Remarkable grid system of roads : Roads cutting at right angle to
each other
• Large scale use of burnt bricks & total absence of stone buildings
• Agriculture technology was well developed (But no use of
ploughshare): Wheat, Rice, Barley, Peas etc. and they
Domesticated large scale of animals
• Cotton was 1st produced by Indus people hence Greeks called it
Sindon which is derived from Sindh
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
• Harappan were 1st to produce silver in the world + wore gold,
silver & beads Jewelry
• Practiced boat making, seal making, Bronze smith etc.
• Granaries & seals show Harappan carried on considerable
trade but only through Barter system

said that it was ruled by merchants not priests
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
• Worshiped Goddess Earth, Pipal Tree, Pashupati Mahadeva &
Animals (Bull / Unicorn Rhino)
• 1
st to invent the art of writing – Right to left i.e. Boustrophedon

• Used weights for trade (Mostly in multiple of 16) & Bronze made
marked sticks for measurements
• Were expert in Potter’s wheel & pottery making
• Their greatest artistic creation was ” Seals”
• Mostly limestone was used for sculptures.
Seals – Indus Valley Civilization
• Engraved in pictographic
script – writing is right to left
and yet to be deciphered
• Used on steatite (mainly), soft
river stone (Terracota) , gold
& ivory and mainly used for
trade and commerce
• Used as an amulet to ward off
the evil.
Seals – Indus Valley Civilization

+ Bust of a bearded man in steatite (Mohenjodaro)
• Bronze casting was widely .
• The red sandstone torso found at Harappa is made up of
detachable limbs and head.
Torso Red sandstone Bust of a bearded man
A dancing girl statue
of about 11.5 cm. in
height made up of
bronzes was found
from Mohenjo Daro.
Terracotta – Indus Valley Civilization
• Terracotta is a fire baked clay and is
handmade.
• Examples include Mother Goddess,
Toy carts with wheels etc.
• Compared to stone and bronze
statues the terracotta representations
of human form are crude.
Mother Goddess
Toy carts with wheels
Pottery – Indus Valley Civilization
• Mainly plain, red and black painted – Plain pottery is more common
than painted
• Consists chiefly of very fine wheel- made wares, & very few being
hand-made
• Used for household purpose (storage of water, food grains etc.)
• Used For decoration- Miniature vessels used for decoration (Less
than 1/2 inch)
• Used as perforated pottery (large hole at the bottom and small
holes all over the wall, and probably was used for straining liquor)
Pottery – Indus Valley Civilization
Beads and Ornaments
• Made of precious metals, gemstones, bone and even
baked clay
• Necklaces, armlets and finger rings were common
• Evidences of dead bodies buried along with
ornaments have also been found
• Cinnabar was used as cosmetic, Lipstick, & face-paint
• Even eyeliner’s were all known to them
Beads and Ornaments
Trade &Commerce
• Intensive agricultural production and large-scale
trade played significant roles in flourishing of the
Harappan civilization.
• Agricultural produce, industrial raw materials
(including copper ores, stone, semiprecious shells,
etc.) were traded on a large scale.
Trade &Commerce
• They procured:
 Copper from Khetri mines of Rajasthan;
 Chert blades (crystals of quartz) from Rohri hills of Sindh;
 Carnelian (brownish-red mineral)beads from Gujarat and Sindh;
 Lead from south India;
 Lapis-lazuli (Blue intense gemstone) from Kashmir and Afghanistan;
 Turquoise (green blue stone) and jade (ornamental green) from central
Asia or Iran;
 Amethyst (violet quartz) from Maharashtra; and
 Agate (fineness of grain and variety of color), chalcedony, and carnelian
from Saurashtra
Trade &Commerce
• The occurrence of mature Harappan seals and other artefacts
in contemporary Mesopotamian civilization, and some of the
Mesopotamian and Egyptian objects in Harappan civilization,
and the evidence of Mesopotamian documents established
that the Harappans had the trading relationship with each
other.
Trade &Commerce
Weights &Measures
• The trade requires a regulation of exchange and of weights and
measures
• The system of weights proceeded in a series i.e. o first doubling,
from 1, 2, 4, 8, to 64, then going to 160; then
• Decimal multiples of sixteen, 320, 640, 1600, 6400 (1600 x 4), 8000
(1600 x 5) and 128,000 (i.e. 16000 x 8).
• The tradition of 16 or its multiples continued in India till 1950s.
• Harappan weights and measures were cubical and spherical in
shape and were made up of chert, jasper, and agate
Weights &Measures
Script
• The language of Harappan is still unknown. But some scholars connect it
to the Dravidian languages and others to Indo-Aryan and Sanskrit.
(pictographic)
The religion of Indus Valley People
• Pashupathi Mahadev (Proto Siva)

Mediterranean (Dravidians), though Mongoloids,
Nordics etc were present in the city culture.
Indus Valley Civilization important sites
• In India: Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Lothal, Dholavira, Rangpur,
Surkotda (Gujarat), Banawali (Haryana), Ropar (Punjab).
• In Pakistan: Harappa (on river Ravi), Mohenjodaro (on Indus River in
Sindh), Chanhudaro (in Sindh).
• The civilization was first discovered during an excavation campaign
under Sir John Hubert Marshall in 1921–22 at Harappa following
the discovery of seals by J Fleet.
• Harappan ruins were discovered by Marshall, Rai Bahadur Daya
Ram Sahni and Madho Sarup Vats.
Indus Valley Civilization important sites
• Mohenjodaro ruins were excavated for the first time by R.D.
Banerjee, E. J. H. MacKay and Marshall.
• The Indus Valley cities show a level of sophistication and
advancement not seen in other contemporary civilizations.
• Disposal of the dead was by burial in wooden coffins. Later
on, in the H Symmetry culture, bodies were cremated in urns.

Reasons for Decline of Indus Valley Civilization
• Causes of the decline of this civilization have not been firmly
established. Archaeologists now believe that the civilization did not
come to an abrupt end but gradually declined. People moved
eastwards and cities were abandoned. Writing and trade declined.
• Mortimer Wheeler suggested that Aryan invasion led to the decline
of the Indus Valley. This theory has now been debunked.
• Robert Raikes suggests that tectonic movements and floods caused
the decline.
Reasons for Decline of Indus Valley Civilization
• Lambrick suggests a change in the course of the river Indus caused
its decline.
• Indra is the cause of decline of Indus Valley Civilization by M.
Wheeler.
• Other causes cited include a drying up of the rivers, deforestation
and a destruction of the green cover. It is possible that some cities
were destroyed by floods but not all. It is now accepted that several
factors could have led to the decline of the Indus Valley civilization.
• New cities emerged only about 1400 years later.
Points to learn
• The origin of the Swastika symbol can be traced to the Indus
Valley Civilisation.
• The majority of the scholars believe that the makers of this
civilization were Dravadian.
• Contemporary Civilization of Indus Civilization- Mesopotamia,
Egypt, and China.
Points to learn
• Alexander Cunningham is known as Father of Archeology in India,
• Upper town (High platform): Citadel, Fortified wall to protect from
flood and outsiders for Priest and Administrative officers only.
• Lower town: For merchants, craftsmen, artisans.
• Bricks: mud bricks, burnt bricks, decorated bricks were found only
from Kalibangan, no plastering of wall, excellent drainage system.
• Great bath: Made up with good quality bricks and used only in
ceremonial occasions.
• Great granary: For the storage of grains.
Points to learn
• Knew most metals except Iron, Silver makes it earliest appearance
in IVC.
• Pony tail on Bronze dancing girl statue from Mohenjodaro, knew all
kind of Cosmetics and face paints, ornaments, gold bracelets,
music, dance, dice (found in Harappa), so probably gambling , Chess
like games and Chariot race.
• Wheat, Barley, Cotton was called Sindon by Greeks because Indus
people were first one to cultivate it, especially at Lothal and
Surkotda.
• Weights made up of stones (they were in multiple of 16, 32 etc.).
Points to learn
• Religion: Male and Female both gods are there in this period.
Mother goddess (Fertility), Pashupati Shiva (Mythical, 3 horned
hear) sitting in posture of Yogi surrounded by animals Rhino, tiger,
deer, buffalo, elephant, Pipal trees, Pigeon, Swastik symbol (The
symbol for the first time was found in IVC).
• Disposal of the dead: They had complete burial system. Post
cremation burial, Fractional burial (animal and birds allowed to eat
as much, then bury), Body kept in North-South orientation.
• Script is Boustrophedon (left to right and then right to left and spiral
goes on).

Industrial Policy
• This Policy holds importance in the economy as it was pursued till
the Economic Reforms in 1991.
• Industrial Policy Resolution, 1948
 It declared Indian economy as Mixed Economy
 Small scale industries and cottage industries were given
importance
 Government imposed restriction on foreign investments
Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956
• This policy laid down the basic framework of Industrial Policy.
• This policy is also known as Economic Constitution of India.
• It is classified into three sectors
 Schedule A – which covers Public Sector (17 Industries)
 Schedule B – covering Mixed Sector (i.e. Public & Private) (12
Industries)
 Schedule C – only Private Industries
Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956
• Public Sector
• Small Scale Industry
• Foreign Investment
• This Policy holds importance in the economy as it was pursued till
the Economic Reforms in 1991.
Industrial Policy Statement, 1977
• Focused on Decentralisation
 It gave priority to small scale Industries
 It created a new unit called “Tiny Unit”
 Restrictions on Multinational Companies (MNC) were imposed
Industrial Policy Statement, 1980
• Focus of this was on selective Liberalization
• MRTP Act (Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices), FERA Act
(Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 were introduced.
• The objective was to liberalize industrial sector to increase
industrial productivity and competitiveness of the industrial sector
New Industrial Policy, 1991
• Its Objective was to provide larger role to market forces and to increase
efficiency
• Larger roles were provided by
 L – Liberalization (Reduction of government control)
 P – Privatization (Increasing the role & scope of private sector)
 G – Globalization (Integration of the Indian economy with the world
economy)
• Because of LPG, old domestic firms have to compete with New Domestic firms,
MNC’s and imported items
New Industrial Policy, 1991
• Government allowed Domestic firms to import better technology so as to
improve efficiency and to have access to better technology
• Foreign Direct Investment ceiling was increased from 40% to 51% in
selected sectors.
• Maximum FDI limit is 100% in selected sectors like infrastructure sectors.
• Foreign Investment promotion board was established. It is a single window
FDI clearance agency.
• Technology transfer agreement was allowed under automatic route.
• Phased Manufacturing Programme was a condition on foreign firms to
reduce imported inputs and use domestic inputs, it was abolished in 1991.
New Industrial Policy, 1991
• Public Sector to be Diluted
 Disinvestment
 De-reservations – Industries reserved exclusively for public sector were
reduced
 Professionalization of Management of PSUs
 Sick PSUs to be referred to Board for Industrial and financial restructuring.
(BIFR)
 Scope of MoUs was strengthened.
 MoU is an agreement between a PSU and concerned ministry.
Public Sector
• It can be classified into:-
 Departmental Undertaking – Directly managed by concerned ministry
or department. (e.g. Railways, Posts etc.)
 Non Departmental Undertaking – PSU (e.g. HPCL, IOCL etc.)
 Financial Institution (e.g. SBI, UTI, LIC etc.)
Objectives of setting up PSU were:-
 To create industrial base in the country
 To generate better quality of employment
 To develop basic infrastructure in the country
 To provide resource to the government
 To promote exports and reduce imports
 To reduce inequalities
Public Sector
• Problems of PSUs
 Inappropriate investment decisions
 Pricing Policy
 Excessive overhead cost
 Lack of Autonomy & Accountability
 Overstaffing
 Trade Unionism
 Under Utilization of capacity
PSU Reforms
• New Industrial Policy 1991
• Voluntary Retirement Scheme, 1988 (Golden Handshake)
• Administered Price Mechanism
• Policy of Navratnas (Best performing PSUs were called Navaratnas)
 Government gave them significant degree of autonomy so they can
perform better.
• Policy of Mini Ratnas (Presently 60 PSUs have been granted this status)
• Profitability of PSUs has increased significantly.
PSU Reforms
• Policy of Maharatnas (category created in 2010)
• Three years with an average annual net profit of over Rs. 2500 crore, OR Average annual Net
worth of Rs. 10,000 crore for 3 years, OR Average annual Turnover of Rs. 20,000 crore for 3
years
 PSU must be a Navratna and must be listed in Stock Exchange
 PSU also must have a significant global presence.
• List of Maharatnas
• National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation(ONGC)
• Steel Authority of India Limited(SAIL) Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL)
• Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) Coal India Limited (CIL)
• Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)
DISINVESTMENT
• Disinvestment refers to selling of equity of a PSU to a private sector companies,
financial institutions, general public or workers
Disinvestment versus Privatisation
• Disinvestment refers to selling of equity of a PSU to a private organization or to
general public.
• Privatisation refers to providing for larger role for private capital and enterprise
in the functioning of an economy.
• Privatisation is a wider term than disinvestment. Disinvestment is one of the
means for achieving privatization.
DISINVESTMENT
• Privatisation may result from any of the following:-
 Disinvestment
 Denationalisation (i.e., complete sell off of a PSU)
 Transfer of management and control of a PSU to the private
sector
 Dereservation of areas reserved for the public Sector etc.
Objectives of Disinvestment
• To transfer the resources from non-strategic sector to the strategic sector,
which is much higher on social priority such as basic health, family
welfare, primary education etc.
• To raise funds to cover up the fiscal deficit of the government.
• To improve efficiency of the public sector by inducing private initiative and
competition.
• To enhance accountability of the PSUs by exposing them to the capital
market.
Objectives of Disinvestment
• To reduce political interference by imparting market orientation to the
enterprise.
• Bring down Government equity in all non-strategic PSUs to 26 % or lower,
if necessary.
• Restructure and revive potentially- viable PSUs
• Close down PSUs which cannot be revived
• Fully protect the interest of workers.
The Disinvestment Process
• In 1992, Government constituted a committee on the Disinvestment of
shares in PSE’s headed by Dr. C. Rangarajan to recommend over the policy
of disinvestment.
• The committee recommended that upto 49% equity of the PSUs under the
exclusive participation of the state could be disinvested but for rest of the
industries disinvestment can be allowed upto 74%.
• Further, the government constituted a five member Disinvestment
Commission under the chairmanship of Shri G.V. Ramakrishnan in August
1996 to draw up a comprehensive policy for the long term disinvestment
programme.
• The target for disinvestment is Rs 40,000 crore every year.
SMALL SCALE & COTTAGE INDUSTRIES
• Small Scale Industries are industries in which the investment limit is upto
certain limit which was 1 crore initially 1 crore and now has been
increased to 5 crore
• New Definitions of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
• In accordance with the provision of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
Development (MSMED) Act, 2006
Medium Enterprises Classification
Manufacturing Sector
Enterprises Investment in plant & machinery
Micro Enterprises Does not exceed twenty five lakh rupees
Small Enterprises More than twenty five lakh rupees but does not
exceed five crore rupees
Medium Enterprises More than five crore rupees but does not exceed ten

core rupees
Contribution of Small Scale Industries
• The small scale sector accounts for over 80% of the manufacturing sector's
employment.
• The small-scale accounts for over 34% of the total exports and about 45%
of the manufacturing exports. Further over 90% of exports of the SSIs
consists of non-traditional items like sports goods, readymade garments,
processed foods, chemicals etc.
Problems of Cottage and Small-Scale Industries
1. Non-availability of timely and adequate credit.

NATIONAL MINERAL POLICY (NMP) 2019
• Headed by Mining Ministry, to replace 2008’s policy.
• This is for non-fuel and non-coal minerals
• Allow transfer of mining leases from one company to another, help in their
merger and acquisition
• Grant ‘industry’ status to mining. (so they become eligible for certain tax
benefits / schemes meant for industry sector, if any.)
• R&D, manpower skilling, environmental conservation etc.
• Allowed 100% FDI in mineral exploration
Energy: Electricity
• In India’s present electricity mix consists of:
• Thermal Electricity ( Coal > Gas > Oil) ~64%
• Renewable: Hydroelectricity 13%
• Renewable Energy(Solar, Wind, Biomass etc. except hydro) 21%
• Nuclear ~2%
Electricity → One Nation-One Grid
• Initially, individual states’ electricity grids were interconnected to form 5
regional grid regions namely Northern, Eastern, Western, North Eastern &
Southern region.
• If a state had surplus electricity , it could sell ONLY to other states in that
region.
• So, One Nation-One Grid concept aims to connect all 5 regional grids into
one national grid so, electricity can be transferred from surplus region to
deficient region.
• Here buying-selling of electricity is done through power exchanges like
Power Exchange of India (PXIL) and India Energy Exchange (IEX).
• Headed by Power ministry i.e. Power Grid Corporation of India Limited.
Green Energy Corridor Project
• Headed by Power ministry i.e. Power Grid Corporation of India Limited +
loan support from Asian Development Bank.
• Project will enable the flow of renewable energy into this National Grid
Network.
• So that renewable energy rich States like Rajasthan (solar), Tamil Nadu
(wind) can sell the electricity to other states.
Energy Renewable
• Autonomous bodies :
• 1. National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE)- Gurugram
• 2. National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE)-Chennai
• 3. Sardar Swaran Singh National Institute of Renewable Energy (SSS NIRE)
– Kapurthala
• PSUs :
• 1. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA)- Delhi, MINI
Ratna
• 2. Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI)- Delhi

INTERIOR OF
THE EARTH
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Earth’s Layers
• Earth’s layers are identified by
studying various direct and
indirect sources
• The structure of the earth’s
interior is made up of
several concentric layers.
• Broadly three layers can be
identified—crust, mantle and
the core.
The Crust
• Crust is the outer thin layer with a total
thickness normally between 30-50 km.
• The thickness of the crust varies under
the oceanic and continental areas.
• Oceanic crust is thinner (5-30 km
thick) as compared to the continental
crust (50-70 km thick).
• The continental crust is thicker in the
areas of major mountain systems. It is as
much as 70 -100 km thick in the
Himalayan region.
The Crust
• Mohorovicic (Moho) discontinuity forms the
boundary between crust and
asthenosphere [asthenosphere is a part of mantle].
• The outer covering of the crust is of sedimentary
material (granitic rocks) and below that lie crystalline,
igneous and metamorphic rocks which are acidic in
nature.
• The lower layer of the crust consists of basaltic and ultrabasic rocks.
• The continents are composed of lighter silicates—silica +
aluminium (also called ‘sial’) while the oceans have the
heavier silicates—silica + magnesium (also called ‘sima’).
Mantle
• The mantle extends from Moho’s
discontinuity (35 km) to a depth of 2,900
km (Moho-Discontinuity to the outer core).
• The crust and the uppermost part of the
mantle are called lithosphere. Its thickness
ranges from 10-200 km.
• The lower mantle extends beyond the
asthenosphere. It is in solid state.
• The density increases as we go in the lower
part.
• It is composed of solid rock and magma.
• It forms 83 per cent of the earth’s volume.
Asthenosphere
• The upper portion of the mantle is
called asthenosphere extending up to
400 km.
• It is the main source of magma that
finds its way to the surface during
volcanic eruptions.
Core
• Lies between 2900 km and 6400
km below the earth’s surface.
• Accounts for 16 per cent of the earth’s
volume.
• Core has the heaviest mineral materials
of highest density.
• It is composed of nickel and iron [nife].
• The outer core is liquid while the inner
core is solid.

INTERIOR OF
THE EARTH- Part 2 (Earthquakes)
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Interior of The Earth
• Earth’s interior is essential to understand
the nature of changes that take place over
and below the earth’s surface.
• To understand geophysical phenomenon
like volcanism, earthquakes etc..
• Future deep-sea mineral exploration etc.
• To understand the evolution and present
composition of atmosphere
Sources of information about the interior
• Exogenic as well as endogenic processes are constantly shaping the
landscape.
• Direct Sources
 Deep earth mining and drilling reveals the nature of rocks deep down the
surface.
 Volcanic eruption forms another source of obtaining direct information.
• Indirect Sources
 Depth: With depth, pressure and density increases and hence temperature.
This is mainly due to gravitation.
Seismic waves
• The study of seismic waves provides
a complete picture of the layered
interior.
• Tremors produced by vibratory
waves through rocks of earth mainly
along a fault
• Place of origin is called Focus or
Hypocenter
• Point vertically above focus on earth
surface is called Epicenter. It is the
first one to experience the waves.
• Shock waves travel in all directions
from focus & shaking is maximum at
Epicenter on earth surface
Causes of Earthquakes
• Compressional or tensional stresses built up at the margins
of the huge moving lithospheric plates.
• Sudden release of stress along a fault, or fracture in the
earth’s crust.
• Sudden slipping of rock formations along faults and
fractures in the earth’s crust happen due to constant
change in volume and density of rocks due to intense
temperature and pressure in the earth’s interior.
Human Induced Earthquakes
 Deep mining activities
 Underground nuclear tests
 Reservoir induced seismicity (RIS)
 Extraction of fossil fuels
 Groundwater extraction
Earthquake Waves
• All natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere (depth up to
200 km from the surface of the earth).
• An instrument called ‘seismograph’ records the waves reaching the
surface.
• Earthquake is measured in following scales
• Intensity / Severity of earthquake measured by Mercalli Scale
• Magnitude of earthquake i.e. Energy released at
epicenter measured by Richter scale.
Earthquake Waves
• Earthquake waves are basically of two
types — body waves and surface
waves.
• Body waves are generated due to the
release of energy at the focus and
move in all directions travelling
through the body of the earth. Hence,
the name body waves.
• The body waves interact with the
surface rocks and generate new set of
waves called surface waves. These
waves move along the surface.
Earthquake Waves
There are two types of body waves.
They are called P and S-waves.
And L is called Surface waves
1. ‘P’ waves or primary waves
(longitudinal nature),
2. ‘S’ waves or secondary waves
(transverse in nature) while the
3. ‘L’ waves or surface waves are
long.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• Also called as the longitudinal or
compressional waves.
• Travel in all mediums solid, liquid & gases
with speed of approx. 8 km/s
• Velocity of P waves in Solids > Liquids >
Gases
• Particles of the medium vibrate along the
direction of propagation of the wave.
• P-waves move faster and are the first to
arrive at the surface and are of high
frequency.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• The shadow zone for ‘P’ waves
is an area that corresponds to
an angle between 1030 and
1420
that does not receive any
direct P waves.
• This gives clues about Solid
inner core.
Secondary Waves (S waves)
• Also called as transverse or distortional waves.
• Secondary waves, travel in solids only and not
in liquid with speed of approx. 4 km/s
• S-waves arrive at the surface with some time
lag.
• These waves are of high frequency waves.
• S-waves passing from the mantle to the core
are absorbed because shear waves cannot be
transmitted through liquids.
• The shadow zone for ‘S’ waves led to the
discovery of liquid outer core. Since S waves
cannot travel through liquid, they do not pass
through the liquid outer core.
Surface Waves (L waves)
• Also called as long period waves.
• They are low frequency, long wavelength, and transverse vibration.
• They cause displacement of rocks, and hence, the collapse of
structures occurs.
• These waves are responsible for most the destructive force of
earthquake affect the surface of the Earth only .
• Recoded last on the seismograph.
• P-Waves involve compression and rarefaction of the
material as the wave passes through is but not
rotation.
• S-Waves (S stands for secondary or shear or shake).
Also known as transverse waves, because particle
motions are transverse to the direction of movement
of the wavefront, or perpendicular to the ray. These
waves involve shearing and rotation of the material as
the wave passes through it, but not volume change.
• Rayleigh waves or descriptively called "ground roll" in
exploration seismology. The particle motion of this
wave is confined to a vertical plane containing the
direction of propagation. The particle displacements
are greatest at the surface and decrease exponentially
downward. This wave is similar to how ocean waves
propagate.
Propagation of Earthquake Waves
• P-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. This
exerts pressure on the material in the direction of the
propagation leading to stretching and squeezing of the
material.
• The direction of vibrations of S-waves is perpendicular to
the wave direction in the vertical plane. Hence, they create
troughs and crests in the material through which they pass.
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
• Shallow focus earthquake – Depth ( 0 – 60 Km)
• Medium focus earthquake – Depth (70 – 300 km)
• Deep Focus earthquake – Depth (300 – 700 Km)
• Below 700 km – Not very dangerous
• Shallow focus earthquakes are called crustal earthquakes as they
exist in the earth’s crustal layer.
• Deep focus earthquakes are known as intra plate earthquakes, as
they are triggered off by collision between plates i.e. within the
deeper subduction zones of the earth.
Distribution of Earthquakes
• Around the pacific Ocean along
the belt of volcanoes known as
Ring of Fire. 68 percent of the
volcanoes are experienced in this
region.
• From the middle of Asia
(Himalayas, Caspian Sea) through
the Mediterranean Sea to West
Indies. 21 percent earthquakes
are experienced in the region.
• Mid-Atlantic ridge belt which
accounts for 11 percent of the
earthquake.

INTERIOR OF
THE EARTH
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Interior of The Earth
• The configuration of the surface of the earth is
largely a product of the processes operating in
the interior of the earth.
• Exogenic as well as endogenic processes are
constantly shaping the landscape.
Sources of information about the interior
• Direct Sources
 Deep earth mining and drilling reveals the nature of rocks deep
down the surface.
 Volcanic eruption forms another source of obtaining direct
information.
• Indirect Sources
 Depth: With depth, pressure and density increases and hence
temperature. This is mainly due to gravitation.
Sources of information about the interior
 Gravitation: The gravitation force (g) is not the same at different
latitudes on the surface. It is greater near the poles and less at
the equator. This is because of the distance from the center at
the equator being greater than that at the poles.
 The gravity values also differ according to the mass of material.
The uneven distribution of mass of material within the earth
influences this value. Such a difference is called gravity anomaly.
Gravity anomalies give us information about the distribution of
mass of the material in the crust of the earth.
Sources of information about the interior
 Meteors: Meteors and Earth are solar system objects that
are born from the same nebular cloud. Thus they are likely
to have a similar internal structure.
 Magnetic field: The geodynamo effect helps scientists
understand what’s happening inside the Earth’s core. Shifts
in the magnetic field also provide clues to the inaccessible
iron core. But their source remains a mystery.
What causes the magnetic field of earth?
• Our planet’s magnetic field is believed to be generated deep down in the
Earth’s core.
• Nobody has ever taken the mythical journey to the centre of the Earth, but
by studying the way shockwaves from earthquakes travel through the
planet, physicists have been able to work out its likely structure.
• Right at the heart of the Earth is a solid inner core, two thirds of the size of
the Moon and composed primarily of iron. At a hellish 5,700°C, this iron is
as hot as the Sun’s surface, but the crushing pressure caused by gravity
prevents it from becoming liquid.
What causes the magnetic field of earth?
• Surrounding this is the outer core, a 2,000 km thick layer of
iron, nickel, and small quantities of other metals. Lower
pressure than the inner core means the metal here is fluid.
• Differences in temperature, pressure and composition within
the outer core cause convection currents in the molten metal
as cool, dense matter sinks whilst warm, less dense matter
rises. The Coriolis force, resulting from the Earth’s spin, also
causes swirling whirlpools.
What causes the magnetic field of earth?
• This flow of liquid iron generates electric currents, which in
turn produce magnetic fields. Charged metals passing through
these fields go on to create electric currents of their own, and
so the cycle continues. This self-sustaining loop is known as
the geodynamo.
• The spiraling caused by the Coriolis force means that separate
magnetic fields created are roughly aligned in the same
direction, their combined effect adding up to produce one
vast magnetic field engulfing the planet.
High Levels of Temperature and Pressure Downwards
• Volcanic eruptions and existence of hot springs,
geysers etc. point to an interior which is very hot.
• The high temperatures are attributed to automatic
disintegration of the radioactive substances.
• Gravitation and the diameter of the earth helps in
estimating pressures deep inside.
High Levels of Temperature and Pressure Downwards
Evidence From The Meteorites
• When they fall to earth, their outer layer is burnt during their fall
due to extreme friction and the inner core is exposed.
• The heavy material composition of their cores confirms the similar
composition of the inner core of the earth, as both evolved from
the same star system in the remote past.
• The most important indirect source is seismic activity. The major
understanding of the earth’s internal structure is mainly from the
study of seismic waves.
Evidence From The Meteorites
Seismic waves
• The study of seismic waves provides a complete picture of
the layered interior.
Causes of Earthquakes
• Most earthquakes are causally related to compressional or tensional
stresses built up at the margins of the huge moving lithospheric plates.
• The immediate cause of most shallow earthquakes is the sudden release
of stress along a fault, or fracture in the earth’s crust.
• Sudden slipping of rock formations along faults and fractures in the earth’s
crust happen due to constant change in volume and density of rocks due
to intense temperature and pressure in the earth’s interior.
• Volcanic activity also can cause an earthquake but the earthquakes of
volcanic origin are generally less severe and more limited in extent than
those caused by fracturing of the earth’s crust.
Causes of Earthquakes
• Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones
where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault
lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic
plates that make up Earth’s crust.
• Plate tectonics: Slipping of land along the fault line along,
convergent, divergent and transform boundaries cause
earthquakes. Example: San Andreas Fault is a transform fault where
Pacific plate and North American plate move horizontally relative to
each other causing earthquakes along the fault lines.
Human Induced Earthquakes
• Some earthquakes are human induced. Earthquakes in the reservoir region, mining
sites etc. are human induced.
• Some Earthquake inducing human activities
 Deep mining
 Underground nuclear tests
 Reservoir induced seismicity (RIS)
 Extraction of fossil fuels
 Groundwater extraction
 Artificial induction
 In fluid injection, the slip is thought to be induced by premature release of elastic strain, as in
the case of tectonic earthquakes, after fault surfaces are lubricated by the liquid.
Volcanic Earthquakes
• A separate type of earthquake is associated with volcanic activity
and is called a volcanic earthquake.
• Yet it is likely that even in such cases the disturbance is the result of
a sudden slip of rock masses adjacent to the volcano and the
consequent release of elastic strain energy.
• The stored energy, however, may in part be of hydrodynamic origin
due to heat provided by magma moving in reservoirs beneath the
volcano or to the release of gas under pressure.
Volcanic Earthquakes
• There is a clear correspondence between the geographic distribution of
volcanoes and major earthquakes, particularly in the Circum-Pacific Belt
and along oceanic ridges.
• Volcanic vents, however, are generally several hundred kilometres from
the epicenters of most major shallow earthquakes, and many earthquake
sources occur nowhere near active volcanoes.
• Even in cases where an earthquake’s focus occurs directly below
structures marked by volcanic vents, there is probably no immediate
causal connection between the two activities; most likely both are the
result of the same tectonic processes.
What causes earthquakes?
• Abrupt release of energy along a fault causes earthquake waves.
• A fault is a sharp break in the crustal rock layer.
• Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. But the friction
exerted by the overlying rock strata prevents the movement of rock layer.
With time pressure builds up.
• Under intense pressure, the rock layer, at certain point, overcomes the
friction offered by the overlying layer and undergoes an abrupt movement
generating shockwaves.
• This causes a release of energy, and the energy waves travel in all
directions.
What causes earthquakes?
• The point where the energy is
released is called the focus of an
earthquake, alternatively, it is called
the hypocentre.
• The energy waves travelling in
different directions reach the
surface. The point on the surface,
nearest to the focus, is called
epicentre. It is the first one to
experience the waves. It is a point
directly above the focus.
Causes Earthquakes
• Focus
 The place of origin of an earthquake inside the earth.
• Epicenter
 Point on the earth’s surface vertically above the focus.
 Maximum damage is caused at the epicenter.
• Wave Velocity
 5 to 8 km per second through the outer part of the crust but travel faster with
depth.
• Isoseismic Line
 A line connecting all points on the surface of the earth where the intensity is the
same.
Earthquake Waves
• All natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere (depth up to
200 km from the surface of the earth).
• An instrument called ‘seismograph’ records the waves reaching the
surface.
• Earthquake waves are basically of two types — body waves and
surface waves.
• Body waves are generated due to the release of energy at the focus
and move in all directions travelling through the body of the earth.
Hence, the name body waves.
Earthquake Waves
• The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new
set of waves called surface waves. These waves move along the
surface.
• The velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with
different elasticity (stiffness) (Generally density with few
exceptions). The more elastic the material is, the higher is the
velocity. Their direction also changes as they reflect or refract when
coming across materials with different densities.
• There are two types of body waves. They are called P and S-waves.
Earthquake Waves
Behavior of Earthquake Waves
• The earthquake waves are measured with the help of a seismograph and
are of three types—
1. the ‘P’ waves or primary waves (longitudinal nature),
2. secondary waves or ‘S’ waves (transverse in nature) while the
3. surface waves are long or ‘L’ waves.
• The velocity and direction of the earthquake waves undergo changes
when the medium through which they are travelling changes.
• When an earthquake or underground nuclear test sends shock waves
through the Earth, the cooler areas, which generally are rigid, transmit
these waves at a higher velocity than the hotter areas.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• Also called as the longitudinal or
compressional waves.
• Particles of the medium vibrate
along the direction of propagation
of the wave.
• P-waves move faster and are the
first to arrive at the surface.
• These waves are of high
frequency.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• They can travel in all mediums.
• Velocity of P waves in Solids >
Liquids > Gases
• Their velocity depends on shear
strength or elasticity of the
material.
• The shadow zone for ‘P’ waves is
an area that corresponds to an
angle between 1030 and 1420
• This gives clues about Solid inner
core.
Secondary Waves (S waves)
• Also called as transverse or distortional
waves.
• Analogous to water ripples or light waves.
• S-waves arrive at the surface with some
time lag.
• A secondary wave cannot pass through
liquids or gases.
• These waves are of high frequency waves.
• Travel at varying velocities (proportional to
shear strength) through the solid part of
the Earth’s crust, mantle.
Secondary Waves (S waves)
• The shadow zone of ‘S’ waves extends
almost halfway around the globe from the
earthquake’s focus.
• The shadow zone for ‘S’ waves is an area
that corresponds to an angle between
1030 and 1800
• This observation led to the discovery of
liquid outer core. Since S waves cannot
travel through liquid, they do not pass
through the liquid outer core.
Surface Waves (L waves)
• Also called as long period waves.
• They are low frequency, long wavelength, and transverse vibration.
• Generally affect the surface of the Earth only and die out at smaller depth.
• Develop in the immediate neighborhood of the epicenter.
• They cause displacement of rocks, and hence, the collapse of structures
occurs.
• These waves are responsible for most the destructive force of earthquake.
• Recoded last on the seismograph.
Propagation of Earthquake Waves
• Different types of earthquake waves travel in different manners. As they move or
propagate, they cause vibration in the body of the rocks through which they pass.
• P-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. This exerts pressure on the
material in the direction of the propagation.
• As a result, it creates density differences in the material leading to stretching and
squeezing of the material.
• Other two waves vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
• The direction of vibrations of S-waves is perpendicular to the wave direction in the
vertical plane. Hence, they create troughs and crests in the material through which
they pass.
Emergence of Shadow Zone
• Earthquake waves get recorded in
seismographs located at far off
locations.
• However, there exist some specific
areas where the waves are not
reported. Such a zone is called the
‘shadow zone’.
• The study of different events reveals
that for each earthquake, there
exists an altogether different
shadow zone.
Emergence of Shadow Zone
• It was observed that seismographs located at any distance
within 105 ° from the epicenter, recorded the arrival of both P
and S-waves.
• However, the seismographs located beyond 145 ° from
epicenter, record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of Swaves.
• Thus, a zone between 105 ° and 145 ° from epicenter was
identified as the shadow zone for both the types of waves.
The entire zone beyond 105 ° does not receive S-waves.
Emergence of Shadow Zone
• The shadow zone of S-wave is much
larger than that of the P-waves. The
shadow zone of P-waves appears as
a band around the earth between
105 ° and 145 ° away from the
epicenter.
• The shadow zone of S-waves is not
only larger in extent but it is also a
little over 40 per cent of the earth
surface.
But how these properties of ‘P’ and ‘S’ waves
help in determining the earth’s interior?
• Reflection causes waves to rebound whereas refraction makes
waves move in different directions.
• The variations in the direction of waves are inferred with the help of
their record on seismograph.
• Change in densities greatly varies the wave velocity.
• By observing the changes in velocity, the density of the earth as a
whole can be estimated.
• By the observing the changes in direction of the waves (emergence
of shadow zones), different layers can be identified.
Why does sound wave travel faster in a denser
medium whereas light travels slower?
• Sound is a mechanical wave and travels by compression and
rarefaction of the medium.
• Its velocity in an elastic medium is proportional to the square
root of Tension in the medium.
• A higher density leads to more elasticity in the medium and
hence the ease by which compression and rarefaction can
take place. This way the velocity of sound increases by
increase in density.
Why does sound wave travel faster in a denser
medium whereas light travels slower?
• Light on the other hand is a transverse electromagnetic wave.
• It does not depend on the elastic property of the medium in
which it travels.
• Its velocity in a medium is determined by the electromagnetic
(e.g. dielectric) properties of the medium.
• Effective path length on the other hand is increased by an
increase in the density and hence it leads to higher refractive
index and lower velocity.
Why S-waves cannot travel through liquids?
• S-waves are shear waves, which move particles perpendicularly to their direction
of propagation.
• They can propagate through solid rocks because these rocks have enough shear
strength.
• The shear strength is one of the forces that hold the rock together, and prevent it
from falling into pieces.
• Liquids do not have the same shear strength: that is why, if you take a glass of
water and suddenly remove the glass, the water will not keep its glass shape and
will just flow away.
• In fact, it is just a matter of rigidity: S-waves need a medium rigid enough to
propagate. Hence, S-waves do not propagate through liquids.
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
• Wadati Benioff zone is a zone of subduction along which earthquakes are
common.
• A Wadati–Benioff zone is a zone of seismicity corresponding with the down-going
slab in a subduction zone (Convergent Boundary).
• Differential motion along the zone produces numerous earthquakes.
• Shallow focus earthquakes (most common at submarine ridges. Hardly felt)
• Intermediate focus earthquakes (somewhat severe)
• Deep focus earthquakes (Occurs at trenches – convergent boundary. Very
powerful. Japan lies along trench line. Hence it faces devastating earthquakes).
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
• Shallow focus earthquakes are called crustal earthquakes as they exist in the
earth’s crustal layer.
• Deep focus earthquakes are known as intra plate earthquakes, as they are
triggered off by collision between plates.
• Shallow-focus earthquakes occur at depths less than 70 km, while deep-focus
earthquakes occur at greater focal depths of 300 – 700 km.
• Shallow focus earthquakes are found within the earth’s outer crustal layer, while
deep focus earthquakes occur within the deeper subduction zones of the earth.
• Shallow focus earthquakes are of smaller magnitudes, of a range 1 to 5, while deep
focus earthquakes are of higher magnitudes, 6 to 8 or more.
Distribution of Earthquakes
• Around the pacific Ocean along the belt of volcanoes
known as Ring of Fire. 68 percent of the volcanoes are
experienced in this region.
• From the middle of Asia (Himalayas, Caspian Sea)
through the Mediterranean Sea to West Indies. 21
percent earthquakes are experienced in the region.
• Mid-Atlantic ridge belt which accounts for 11 percent
of the earthquake.
Distribution of Earthquakes
Effects of Earthquakes
• Earthquakes cause landslides, damming of rivers, depressions which form
lakes.
• They can cause submergence and emergence of landforms along coastal
regions. Example: Coastline of Kutch.
• Lead to change in surface drainage and underground circulation of water.
• More devastating features of earthquakes are fires and seismic waves
(tsunamis).
• Formation of cracks or fissures especially in the region of the epicenter is
common.
Earth’s Layers
• Earth’s layers are identified by studying various direct and
indirect sources [we studied this in previous post: Earth’s
Interior – Earthquake Waves – Shadow Zone].
• The structure of the earth’s interior is made up of
several concentric layers.
• Broadly three layers can be identified—crust, mantle and
the core.
Earth’s Layers
Earth’s Layers
The Crust
• Crust is the outer thin layer with a total thickness normally
between 30-50 km.
• The thickness of the crust varies under the oceanic and continental
areas.
• Oceanic crust is thinner (5-30 km thick) as compared to the
continental crust (50-70 km thick).
• The continental crust is thicker in the areas of major mountain
systems. It is as much as 70 -100 km thick in the Himalayan region.
• It forms 5-1.0 per cent of the earth’s volume.
The Crust
• Mohorovicic (Moho) discontinuity forms the boundary between crust
and asthenosphere [asthenosphere is a part of mantle].
• The outer covering of the crust is of sedimentary material (granitic
rocks) and below that lie crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks
which are acidic in nature.
• The lower layer of the crust consists of basaltic and ultra-basic rocks.
• The continents are composed of lighter silicates—silica + aluminium (also
called ‘sial’) while the oceans have the heavier silicates—silica +
magnesium (also called ‘sima’).
The Crust
Mantle
• The mantle extends from Moho’s discontinuity (35 km) to a depth
of 2,900 km (Moho-Discontinuity to the outer core).
• The crust and the uppermost part of the mantle are called lithosphere. Its
thickness ranges from 10-200 km.
• The lower mantle extends beyond the asthenosphere. It is in solid state.
• The density of mantle varies between 2.9 and 3.3.
• The density ranges from 3.3 to 5.7 in the lower part.
• It is composed of solid rock and magma.
• It forms 83 per cent of the earth’s volume.
• The outer layer of the mantle is partly simatic while the inner layer is
composed of wholly simatic ultra-basic rocks.
Asthenosphere
• The upper portion of the mantle is called
asthenosphere.
• The word astheno means weak.
• It is considered to be extending up to 400 km.
• It is the main source of magma that finds its way to the
surface during volcanic eruptions. It has a density higher
than the crust’s.
Core
• Lies between 2900 km and 6400 km below the earth’s surface.
• Accounts for 16 per cent of the earth’s volume.
• Core has the heaviest mineral materials of highest density.
• It is composed of nickel and iron [nife].
• The outer core is liquid while the inner core is solid.
• A zone of mixed heavy metals + silicates separates the core from
outer layers.
Seismic Discontinuities
Seismic Discontinuities
1. Mohorovicic Discontinuity (Moho) – separates the crust from
the mantle, its average depth being about 35 km.
2. A soft asthenosphere (highly viscous, mechanically weak and
ductile). It’s a part of mantle.
3. Gutenberg Discontinuity – lies between the mantle and the
outer core. Below 2900 km from earth’s surface.

UN Preamble
• UN preamble was given
by Field Marshal Smut.
2. Bretton Woods Organizations
• It was held in Bretton Woods town, New Hampshire in USA after
the WW2 (1939-45) to restore the global economy. Total 44 nations
participated, incl. India. It proposed 3 international institutions:
1. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), commonly known as World Bank.
2. International Monetary Fund (IMF).
3. (Proposed) International Trade Organisation (ITO). But could
not materialize due to American opposition. Instead, the
countries later setup GATT and turns into WTO.
Bretton Woods Organizations
• While World bank and IMF are considered “Specialized Agencies of
UN ”, the WTO is considered “Related organization of UN because it
doesn’t fulfill all requirements of UN charter on specialized
agencies.
• BRETTON WOODS → 1) WORLD BANK, WASHINGTON, 1944
• It originally focused on reconstructing war-torn European countries.
After 50s focusing on poor countries of Asia and Africa. World Bank
comprises of 5 institutions.
World Bank Components
• 1) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):
Commonly known as the world bank. Gives development loans with
interest.
• 2) International Development Association (IDA) : Assists the poorest
countries through interest-free long-term loans (Concessional Loans or
soft loans).
• 3) International Finance Corporation (IFC) : supports private enterprise in
developing countries. Known for its Masala Bonds (Masala
bonds are bonds issued outside India but denominated in Indian Rupees,
rather than the local currency.
World Bank Components
• Masala is an Indian word and it means spices. The term was used by the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to evoke the culture and cuisine of
India.)
• 4) Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) : offers (foreign)
investors insurance against
• non-commercial risk (such as political instability, regime change etc.). This
helps 3
rd world nations attract foreign investment.
• 5) International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID): Helps in dispute resolution related to foreign investment / foreign
companies in 3rd world countries.
Voting Power
• In the first four organizations, voting power depends on the share
capital provided by a country. USA highest, followed by various
European giants.
• Fifth is a “dispute settlement” body, so the concept of ‘each
country’s voting power’ does not apply to it.
IMF, WASHINGTON, 1945
• International Monetary Fund helps in global currency exchange
stability, helps against balance of payment crisis.
• Acts as a reservoir of the currencies of all the member countries,
from which a borrower nation can borrow the currency of other
nations- using the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) mechanism.
• World Economic Outlook and 'Global Financial Stability Report' is
prepared by IMF.
• The major difference between IMF and WB is that IMF gives short
term loan and WB gives long term loan to member nations.
World Bank President
• Since USA and European powers collectively command large
shareholding in World Bank & IMF, so their informal arrangement
is- USA’s favorite will be picked as World Bank chief, while European
countries’ favorite will be picked as IMF Chief.
Multilateral Development Bank
• (NON-BRETTON WOODS) → MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS
• A multilateral development bank is an institution, created by a
group of countries, that provides financing and professional
advising for the purpose of development. Apart from World bank,
the other notable examples are
BRICS Nations
• BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India and China, South Africa) was formulated
in 2001 by economist Jim O'Neill, of Goldman Sachs, in a report on
growth prospects for the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and

Iranian (Persian) &
Macedonian (Greek)
Invasion
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Persian Invasion (550 BC)
• Cyrus, the founder of the Achaemenid
Empire in ancient Iran invaded the
North-Western front of India in 550 BC.
• Contemporary to reign of Bimbisara,
Persian attacked N-W front of India &
Magadha continued to rise in N-E &
Central-north in India
• In N-W front of India, several small
provinces like Kamboja, Gandhara &
Madra did not have a political unity &
continuously fought with each other.
• At that time, Bimbisara of Haryanka
dynasty was ruling over Magadha.
Persian Invasion (550 BC)
• Archaemadian ruler of Iran, Cyrus took
advantage of this political disunity & invaded
west front of India.
• All Indian tribes west of Indus River submitted
to him including Gandhar
• Darius I (4
th persian king), Grandson of Cyprus
conquered Indus valley as a whole & annexed
Punjab & Sindh (N W India)
• Xerxes, Successor of Darius, employed Indian
infantry & cavalry in war against Greece but
got defeated & hence could not move forward
in India. However, control of Persians over
India reduced only after Alexander’s invasion
on India
Effects of Persian Invasion
• Impetus to Indo Iranian
commerce & trade, which finally
became the ground for
Alexander’s invasion. India learnt
the necessity of a strong and
united empire to rebel the
foreign invasions.
• Use of Kharoshti script bought by
Iranian gain popularity in N-W
India & some inscription of
Ashoka (250 BC) are written in
this language (derived from
Aramaic script, written from
right to left)
Effects of Persian Invasion
• Influence of Persian art in India,
Particularly monolithic pillars, &
sculptures found on them along
with inscriptions
• With time a large number of
foreigners, Greek, Persians and
Turks etc. settled down in north
west part of India and
completely absorbs among
Indians.
• Influenced the coinage system in
India because Persian coins were
known for their refined minting
and elegant looks.
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• After 2 centuries of Persian invasion,
Alexander from Macedonia invaded India.
• Alexander (356 BC – 323 BC) was the son
of Philip of Macedonia.
• He became king in 336 BC.
• Alexander had conquered Asia Minor
along with Iran and Iraq. He then
marched into northwest India from Iran.
He had annexed the whole of Persia by
defeating Persian King Darius III in the
Battle of Arbela (330 BC).
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• Alexander was attracted to India’s wealth.
• Alexander believed that on eastern side of
India lies continuation of the sea & hence by
conquering India, he would conquer eastern
boundary of the world
• After conquest of Iran, he marched into India
through Khyber pass 327 BC & crossed Indus in
326 BC.
• In northwest India, just before Alexander’s
invasion, there were many small rulers like
Ambhi of Taxila, and Porus of the region of
Jhelum (Hydaspes).
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• Ambhi accepted Alexander’s sovereignty
but Porus put up a valiant but unsuccessful
fight.
• Alexander was so impressed with Porus’s
fight that he granted him his territory back.
Porus might have accepted lordship. The
battle between him and Porus is called the
Battle of Hydaspes.
• After that, Alexander’s army crossed the
river Chenab and annexed the tribes
between Ravi and Chenab.
• But his army refused to cross the river Beas
and revolted. They were exhausted after
years of battles.
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• Alexander was forced to retreat in 326 BC. On his way back, he died at Babylon (Mesopotmia/Iraq)
in 323 BC aged 32.
• After his death, the Greek Empire split in 321 BC.
• In northwest India, Alexander left four of his generals in charge of four regions, one of them being
Seleucus I Nicator, who would later trade his territories in the Indus Valley with Chandragupta
Maurya.
• Lysimachus, Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus.
• Lysimachus took Thrace and much of Asia Minor;
• Cassander, Macedonia and Greece;
• Ptolemy seized Egypt, Palestine, Cilicia, Petra, and Cyprus (thus beginnng the Ptolemaic Dynasty
in Egypt which lasted until the death of Cleopatra VII in 31 BCE)
• while Seleucus took control of the rest of Asia (so founding the Seleucid Empire which was
comprised of Syria, Babylon, Persia, and India).
• Eudamas was the last General of Alexander in India.
Effect of Alexander’s Invasion
• First contact b/w Europe & India paved the way for increased
trade & commerce
• Encouraged political unification of India under Mauryas
• Post the invasion there were Indo-Greek rulers in the
northwest part of India.
• Alexander’s authority in Indus valley was short lived because
of expansion of Mauryan Empire under Chandragupta
maurya.
Effect of Alexander’s Invasion
• The invasion led to the establishment of more Greek settlements in this
area. The most important of them were the city of Alexandria in the Kabul
region, Boukephalc on the Jhelum, and Alexandria in Sindh.
• Indirectly this invasion made possibly the establishment of Indo-Bacterian
and Indo-Parthian states, which later stage influenced Indian Architecture
(Gandhara school of sculpture), astronomy, coinage etc.
• The date of the invasion of Alexander is the first reliable date in early
Indian History and considerably helps us in solving chronological
difficulties.

Jainism
Explained By
Dr Vipan Goyal
Jainism
• The freedom of thought allows fermentation of the new ideas and
philosophic principles, leading to the establishment of numerous
religious sects, which had never happened in India before.
• The important landmark in the history of Indian culture was the
evolution of Jainism and Buddhism during the 600 B.C.
• Jainism and Buddhism have greatly influenced the society and
culture of India. They stand against certain aspects of the preexisting system of old ritualistic Vedic tradition.
Jainism
• Ascetic orders and brotherhoods were the basis of both Jainism and
Buddhism explained in their own way.
• Rishabhanath and Aristhanemi are the two Tirthankaras of Jainism
mentioned in Rig Veda that proves the antiquity of Jainism.
• Tirthankaras means the one who shows the right path to anothers.
• Rishabhanath had been mentioned an incarnation of Narayana in
Vayu Purana and Bhagwat Purana.
Jainism
• The nude sculpture of some Tirthanakara was also found at
Harappa.
• Jainism is of ancient origin & believed to have 24
Tirthankaras / Great teachers in their religion
• 1
st one was Rishabdev (Born in Ayodhya, Emblem: Bull) who
is said to have laid the foundation of orderly human society
& realised that the source of Jaina philosophy was Adinath.
Jainism
• The traditions of Jainism say that he was a king and renounced the
kingdom in favor of his son, Bharata, and became an ascetic.
• The name Bharatavarsha is after Bharata, the son of Rishabhanath
as per the Puranic traditions.
• 23rd was Parshavnath (Born in Varanasi, Emblem: Snake) & Last and
24th was Vardhamana Mahavira (Born 540 BC at Kundangrama near
Vaishali, Emblem: Lion)
• All the Tirthankaras were Kshatriyas by birth.

Vardhamana Mahavira
• Mahavira, also known as Vardhamana, Vira, Viraprabhu,
Sanmati, Ativira, Gnatputra (in Tamil Texts) and Nigrantha
Nātaputta (in Pali canon), was 24th Tirthankar of Jainism.
• Mahavira was born about 540 B.C. in the village Kunda-grama
near Vaisali.
• He was the only son of Siddhartha and Trisala.
Vardhamana Mahavira
• Siddhartha was the head of famous kshatriya Jnatrika clan and Trisala was
the sister of Chetaka, an eminent Lichchhavi noble of Vaisali.
• Chetaka's daughter was married to the king of Magadha, Bimbisara.
• Mahavira was married to Yasoda and lived a life of a householder and had
a daughter Anojja or Priyadarsani
• Priyadarsani later married to Jamali, who was also a disciple of Mahavira.
As per Digambara tradition, Mahavira was never married.
Vardhamana Mahavira
• After the death of his parents,
Mahavira left his home at the age of
thirty with the permission of his elder
brother Nandivardan and became an
ascetic.
• In search of truth Mahavira
abandoned the world at the age of
30 & became ascetic & meditated for
12 years practicing austerities.
Vardhamana Mahavira
• After 13 years of penance, he attained the highest spiritual
knowledge called Kevala Jnan.
• He attained this at Jimbhikagrama village under a sal tree
aged 42. This is called Kaivalya.
• Thereafter, he was called Mahavira, Jina, Jitendriya (one who
conquered his senses), Nigrantha (free from all bonds) and
Kevalin.
• He also got the title of Arihant i.e. worthy.
Kaivalya
• One who conquered misery & happiness
• Because of this conquest he is known as Mahavira or great hero or
jina (the conqueror) & his followers Jainas.
• His followers came to be known as Jainas.
• Initially, they were designated as Nirgranthas, which means free
from fetters.
• He propagated religion for 30 years & passed away at the age of 72
at Pavapuri near Rajgir
Kaivalya
• Mahavira gave his first sermon in Prakarit ( ardh-magdhi) language
at Vitulanchal Parbat (in Rajgir, Magdha)
• Jamali became his ist disciple.
• 1st female disciple was Champa who was the daughter of King
Dadivahan.
• The number of chief disciples of Mahavira was 11 and they were
known as Gandhar.
• After the death of mahavira, Sudharman became the first chief of
Jain Sanga.
Causes of the rise of Jainism
• Vedic religion had become highly ritualistic.
• Jainism was taught in Prakrit thus was more accessible
to the common man as compared to Sanskrit.
• It was accessible to people of all castes.
• Varna system had rigidified and people of the lower
castes led miserable lives.
• Jainism offered them an honourable place.
Causes of the rise of Jainism
• About 200 years after the death of Mahavira, a great famine
in the Ganga valley prompted Chandragupta Maurya and
Bhadrabahu (last Acharya of the undivided Jain sangha) to
migrate to Karnataka. Jainism spread to Southern India after
that.
Doctrines of Parsvanath
• Four doctrines of Parsvanath are:
 Non-injury to living beings,
 Speaking the truth,
 Non-possession of property, and
 Not stealing.
• Vardhaman Mahavira accepted four doctrines of Parsvanath and added
Celibacy as a fifth one to them.
• Celibacy is the complete renunciation and free from any possessions.
Mahavira asked his followers to discard even their clothes
Jain’s Mythology
• The universe is eternal.
• The world is not created, maintained, or destroyed by a God, but it
functions through a universal or eternal law.
• Jains did not deny the existence of God, but they simply ignored.
• The existence of the universe is divided into cycles of progress (Utsarpini)
and declines (Avasarpini). It functions through the interaction of living
souls (Jiva) and everything in the universe has a soul.
Jain’s Mythology
• The souls are found not only in the living beings like animals and plants,
but also in stones, rocks, water, etc.
• The purification of the soul is the purpose of living.
• Only the pure soul after being released from the body resides in heaven.
• The soul, which has finally set itself free, rises at once to the top of the
universe, above the highest heaven where it remains in an inactive
omniscient bliss through eternity. It is known as ‘Nirvana’ in the Jainism.
Jain’s Mythology
• According to Jainism, salvation is possible only by:
 Deserting all belongings,
 A long course of fasting,
 Self-mortification,
 Study and
 Meditation
• Jainism, therefore, says that the monastic life is essential for
salvation.
Jain’s Mythology
• According to the Jaina tradition, the king Chandragupta Maurya has
supported Jainism.
• He had accepted Jaina religion and abdicated the throne and died
as a Jaina Bhikshu in the southern part of India.
• Two hundred years after the death of Mahavira (during the reign of
Chandragupta Maurya), a terrible famine broke out in Magadha.
Bhadrabahu was the chief of the Jaina community at that time.
• Bhadrabahu went to Karnataka with his followers and Sthulabhadra
remained in Magadha as the in-charge of Jainism.
Jain’s Mythology
• Bhadrabahu convoked a council at Patliputra, in which the Jaina canon was
arranged.
• Later in the 5th century A.D., the Jaina canon was further rearranged
when the Jainas returned from south India. From where Jainism divided
into two sects.
• Those who returned from southern India held that complete nudity is an
essential part of the teachings of Mahavira while the monks in Magadha
began to put on white clothes.
• Those who put on white robes known as ‘Svetambaras’ (shwetambaras)
and those who were stark naked were called as ‘Digambaras.
Teachings of Jainism
• Mahavira rejected Vedic principles.
• He did not believe in God’s existence.
• According to him, the universe is a product of the natural
phenomenon of cause and effect.
• He believed in Karma and transmigration of the soul. The body dies
but the soul does not.
• One will be punished or rewarded as per one’s karma.
Teachings of Jainism
• Advocated a life of austerity and non-violence.
• Stressed on equality but did not reject the caste system,
unlike Buddhism. But he also said that man may be ‘good’ or
‘bad’ as per his actions and not birth.
• Asceticism was taken to a great length. Starvation, nudity and
self-mortification were expounded.
• Two elements of the world: Jiva (conscious) and Atma
(unconscious).
3 principles of Jainism → Triratnas
• Right faith (believe in teachings & wisdom of Mahavira)
• Right Knowledge (Acceptance of theory that there is no
god & world has been existing without a creator & all
objects possess a soul)
• Right conduct (Refers to observance of 5 great vows)
Doctrines (Panchmahavrata)
• Ahimsa Mahavrata: Don't commit violence, walk, talk and eat
carefully.
• Satya Mahavrata: Don't tell a lie, think before you speak, don't
speak in anger.
• Asteya Mahavrata: Don't steal.
• Aparigraha Mahavrata: Don't acquire property.
• Brahamcharya Mahavrata: Don't talk, see or think about any
women, don't where there are women, take simple food. (added
by Mahavira)
Important Jainism Philosophy -
Anekantavad aka Syadvada
• Most important and fundamental Doctrines of Jainism. It talks
about Pluralism, multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that
truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points
of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.
• Gautam Buddha gave Pratitya Samutpada i.e. there is a
reason behind everything.
• Mahavir rejected authority of Vedas and Vedic rituals.
Anekantavad
• Philosophically an important contribution of Jainism is the doctrine of
Anekantavad (non-absolutism).
• Every living being has a soul. Every soul is potentially divine, with innate
qualities of infinite knowledge, perception, power, and bliss.
• However, these qualities are masked by its karmas.
• Therefore, Jains think of every living being as themselves, harming no one
and be kind to all living beings. This is the basis of non-violence in Jainism.
• Every soul is the architect of its own life, here or hereafter. When a soul is
freed from karmas, it becomes free and attains divine consciousness,
experiencing infinite knowledge, perception, power, and bliss
Non-violence in Jainism
• Ahimsa is such a cardinal principle of Jainism that it is
called beginning and the end of Jain Religion.
• Ahimsa means not to kill or hurt any living being by body,
mind or speech.
• This vrata or vow is possible for only those who dedicate
their whole life on the basis of Mahavratas and who have
renounced their household life.
Non-possession
• Possession of worldly things perpetrates in violence.
• Desire to get more is the root cause of violence and
bondage of soul with karma.
• Thus, non-possession is the second cardinal principle
of Jainism.
Spread of Jainism
• Admitted both women and shudras in its order of followers
• Used prakrit (common language) for preaching instead of sanskrit
• 200 years after the death of Mahavira, there was a serious famine
in Ganga valley.
• Many Jain followers led by Chandragupta Maurya & Bhadrabahu
left for south (Karnataka) & rest stayed back under the leadership of
Sthalbahu. Emmigrants spread Jainism in south India.
• Sthulabahu changed the
code of conduct and said
that white clothes could be
worn. Thus, split Jainism
into two sects:
 Swetambaras: White-clad;
Northerners
 Digambaras: Sky-clad
(naked); Southerners
Jain Councils
• First council
 Held at Pataliputra in the 3rd century BC.
 Presided by Sthulabahu.
• Second Council
 Held at Vallabhi in Gujarat in the 5th century BC.
 Presided by Devardhigani.
 12 Angas were compiled here
Royal patrons of Jainism
• South India
 Kadamba dynasty
 Ganga dynasty
 Amoghavarsha (Rashtrakuta)
 Kumarapala (Chalukya dynasty)
Royal patrons of Jainism
• North India
 Bimbisara
 Ajatasatru
 Chandragupta Maurya
 Bindusara
 Kharavela
Chalukyans / Solankis are the last great patrons of Jainism.
Royal Patrons of Jainism
• Asoka’s Grandson Samprati
• King Kharvela of Orissa: set up jain rock cut cave
(Hathigumpha, Baghagumpha, Udaigiri and Khandagiri caves)
• Gangs, Kadambs, Chalukyas, Rastrakutas had patronized
Jainism.
• King Amoghavarsha of Rastrakuta dynasty became a Jain
Monk.
Royal Patrons of Jainism
• The Chalukyan period rock cut caves at badami/KTK and
aihole/KTK have the figures of Jain Tirthankaras.
• Samatabhadra in Kanchi/TN preached this religion.
• The Dilwara Jain temples (Vimalavashi, Tejpala temples) at
Mount Abu/Rajasthan were built by Chalukya Dynasty kings
• Statue of Gometeshwara/ Bahubali- Sharavanvelgola
(Karnataka) belongs to Jains
Contribution of Jainism
• 1
st serious attempt to mitigate evil of varna system &
ritualistic vedic system
• Adoption of Prakrit by Jainas helped in its growth & many
regional languages grew out of Prakrit especially Shauraseni,
out of which Marathi grew.
• Jainism religious literature is written in “Ardhamagadhi” & text
were finally compiled at Valabhi (Gujrat)
Jain Texts
• Jain texts are known as Aagham.
• In this 12 angas, 12 upangas, 10 prakiranan, 6
chedsutra, 4 mulasutra included.
• Jain Texts were written in ArdhMagdhi language.
• Premya-Kamatarand by PrabhaChandra
• Kalpasutras in Sanskrit by Bhadrabahu
• Parishishta Parvan by HemaChandra

Karst Landforms
By Dr Vipan
Goyal

Karst Landforms
• Karst topography is a landscape
formed from the dissolution of
soluble rocks such as limestone,
dolomite, and gypsum.
• It is characterized by underground
drainage systems
with sinkholes, caves etc..
• It is so named after a province
of Yugoslavia on the Adriatic
sea coast where such formations are
most noticeable.
Conditions for the formation of Karst Topography
• A region with a large stretch of watersoluble rocks such as limestone at the
surface or sub-surface level
• Limestones should not be porous
• These rocks should be dense, thinly
bedded and well jointed
• A perennial source of water and a low
water table to allow the formation of
conspicuous features.
• Moderate to abundant rainfall to cause
the solvent action of water i.e. solution
of rocks
Mechanism of erosion in Karst region
• In Karst regions, rocks are permeable, thinly bedded
and highly jointed and cracked.
• Thus there is the general absence of surface
drainage as the surface water has gone
underground
• After vertically going down to some depth, the
water under the ground flows horizontally through
the bedding planes, joints or through the materials
themselves.
• Rocks are eroded due to this downward and
horizontal movement of water.
• It is through the chemical process of solution and
precipitation deposition by surface water and
groundwater, varieties of landforms are developed
in rocks like limestones or dolomites rich in calcium
carbonate.
Erosional Landforms
• Caves
• This is an underground cave formed by water
action by various methods in a limestone or
chalk area.
• Cave formation is prominent in areas where
there are alternating beds of rocks (sandstone,
shale, quartzite) with limestone or dolomite in
between or in areas where limestones are
dense, massive and occurring as thick beds.
• Water percolates down either through the
materials or through cracks and joints and
moves horizontally along bedding planes.
• Gradually, the limestone dissolves along these
bedding planes resulting in the creation of long
and narrow gaps called caves.
Arch/Natural Bridge
When a part of the cavern
collapses the portion
which keeps standing
forms an arch.
Sink Hole/Swallow Hole
• These holes are developed by enlargement of the cracks found in such
rocks, as a result of continuous solvent action of the rainwater.
• The surface streams which sink disappear underground through swallow
holes.
• Small to medium-sized round to sub-rounded shallow depressions called
swallow holes form on the surface of limestones through solution where
rainwater sinks into the limestone at a point of weakness
• They are also known as sinkholes
• Sinkholes are a common feature in limestone/karst areas.
• A sinkhole is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped
towards the bottom
• There is a great variation in sizes of Sinkholes with areas from a few sq. m
to a hectare and with depth from a less than half a metre to thirty metres
or more.
• These holes grow in size through continuous solvent action
• They are also referred to as solution sinks
Karst Window
• When a number of adjoining sink holes
collapse, they form an open, broad area
called a karst window.
Sinking Creeks/Bogas
• In a valley, the water often
gets lost through cracks and
fissures in the bed.
• These are called sinking
creeks, and if their tops are
open, they are called bogas.
Doline
• They are also referred to as Collapse
sinks .
• They are less common than sinkholes
• They might start as solution forms first,
and if the bottom of a sinkhole forms
the roof of a void or cave underground,
it might collapse leaving a large hole
opening into a cave or a void below
Uvalas
• They are long, narrow to wide
trenches, also referred to as Valley
sinks .
• Several sinkholes and dolines may
merge together as a result of
subsidence to form a large
depression called an Uvala.
Polje
• A polje is a very large, flat-floored depression in
the karst region.
• They are often formed by merging of several
uvalas or partly due to faulting
• They are commonly found in subtropical and
tropical latitudes
• If the streams lose themselves in these valleys,
then these are called blind valleys.
• During the rainy season, parts of the floor which
are at or near the water table may become
temporary lakes
• Drier areas are fertile. Usually covered with thick
sediments, they are used extensively for
agricultural purposes
Ponor
• A ponor is a natural surface
opening in the karst regions.
• They are found directly
underneath the sinkholes.
• A ponor is kind of a portal where
a surface stream or lake flows
either partially or completely
underground into a karst
groundwater system.
Limestone Pavements
• A limestone pavement is a natural
karst landform consisting of a flat,
incised surface of exposed limestone
that resembles an artificial
pavement.
• These are formed by the solvent
action of underground water in the
limestones, causing progressive
widening and enlargement of joints
and cracks in the trenches.
• The enlarged joints are called grikes
and the isolated, rectangular blocks
are termed as clints.
Landforms due to depositions
• Depositional landforms in karst region are developed due to
the deposition of calcium carbonate.
• The calcium carbonate dissolved during the erosional process
starts to precipitate when the water evaporates.
• Stalactites, Stalagmites and Pillars are the most spectacular
underground features, found in the limestone caves.
Stalactites
• Stalactites are the sharp, slender,
downward-growing structures of
different diameters that hang from
the cave roofs.
• Stalactites have a variety of forms
• Their bases are normally broad
which taper towards the free ends
• The water carries calcium in
solution and when this limecharged water evaporates, it leaves
behind the solidified crystalline
calcium carbonate.
Stalagmites
• Stalagmites form due to dripping
water from the surface or through
the thin pipe, of the stalactite,
immediately below it
• Moisture dripping from the roof
trickles down the stalactite and
drops to the floor where
stalagmites are formed due to
deposition of calcium
• Stalagmites may take the shape of
a column, a disc, with either a
smooth, rounded bulging end or a
miniature crater-like depression.
Stalactite and Stalagmite
Pillars
• Over a long period, the stalactite
is eventually merged with the
stalagmite
• Thus, the pillars or columns of
different diameters are formed.

Kinematics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Kinematics
Kinematics is branch of mechanics
which deals with the study of
motion of the objects without
taking into account the cause of
their motion.
Rest and Motion
• An object is said to be at rest if it does not change its position which
respect to its surroundings with time and said to be in motion if it
changes its position with respect to its surrounding with time.
• Rectilinear or Translatory motion : When a body moves along a
straight path e.g. moving car on horizontal road, motion under
gravity etc.
• Angular motion such as particle going on a circle, projectile motion,
rotation of machine shaft etc.
Rest and Motion
• Rotational motion or circular motion such as motion of a fan.
• Circular motion : When a body moves in a circular path.
• Rotatory motion : When a body spins about its own axis.
• It an object travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, then it
is said to be in uniform motion.
• It an object travels unequal distances in equal intervals of time,
then it is said to be in non-uniform motion.
• Oscillatory and vibratory motion :When a body moves to and
fro or back and forth repeatedly a fixed point in a definite
interval of time, it is said to be in oscillatory motion.
• Amplitude : The extent to which the body moves on either
side of a fixed point.
• Vibratory motion : The oscillatory motion, where the
amplitude is very small.
One, Two and Three Dimensional Motion
• 1-D Motion (motion in a line) : when position of an object
changes only along one axis.
• 2-D Motion (Motion in a plane) : When position of an object
changes along any two axis. e.g. motion of a planet around a
sun.
• 3-D Motion (Motion in a space) : When position of an object
changes in all 3 axes.
Speed
• The distance covered by a moving body in a unit time interval is called its
speed.
• Speed = Distance travelled/ Time taken
• When a body travels equal distances with speed 𝑣1 and 𝑣2, then average
speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.
2/v = 1/v1 + 1/v2 = v = 2v1v2 / v1+v2
• When a body travels for equal times with speeds 𝑣1 and 𝑣2, then average
speed is the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.
v= v1+v2/ 2
Velocity
• The time rate of change of displacement of a body is called its
velocity.
• Velocity = Displacement/ Time
• An object is said to be moving with uniform velocity if it undergoes
equal displacements in equal intervals of time.
• An object is said to be moving with non-uniform or variable
velocity if it undergoes unequal displacement in equal intervals of
time.
• Average velocity = Time displacement / Total time taken
• Average velocity : Vavg = (u+v)/2
• Relative velocity :
• = Va + Vb ( if two bodies a and b travel in opposite direction)
• = Va - Vb ( if two bodies a and b travel in same direction)
Acceleration
• The time rate of change of velocity of a body is called its acceleration.
• Acceleration = Change in velocity / Time taken
• It is a vector quantity and its SI unit is 𝑚𝑠−2.
• Acceleration at an instant of time is known as instantaneous acceleration.
• When the velocity of a body increases with time, then its acceleration is
positive and if velocity decreases with time, then its acceleration is
negative called deceleration or retardation.
• If acceleration does not change with time, it is said to be constant
acceleration.
Equations of Motions
• If a body started its motion with initial velocity u and attains final velocity
v in the interval t. The acceleration assumed to be uniform in motion is a
and the distance travelled is s, then equations of motion:
𝑣 = 𝑢 + 𝑎𝑡
𝑠 = 𝑢𝑡 + ½ 𝑎𝑡2
𝑣2 = 𝑢2 + 2𝑎𝑠
• If any body is falling freely under gravity, then a is replaced by g in above
equations.
• If an object is thrown vertically upward, then in above equations of motion
a is replaced by (–g).
• A time period (denoted by 'T' ) is
the time taken for one complete cycle of
vibration to pass a given point.
• As the frequency of a wave increases,
the time period of the wave decreases.
The unit for time period is 'seconds‘.
• Frequency is the number of occurrences
of a repeating event per unit of time.
• Angular displacement : The angular
displacement is defined as the angle through
which an object moves on a circular path.
• It is the angle, in radians, between the initial
and final positions. (θf
- θi
)
• = angular displacement. θ = s/r.
• SI unit is radian.
• Angular velocity : rate of change of angular
position of a rotating body.
• ω = dθ / dt
• Angular acceleration, also called rotational acceleration, is a
quantitative expression of the change in angular velocity that
a spinning object undergoes per unit time.
• SI unit is radian/sec2
Projectile Motion
• When a body is thrown from horizontal making an angle (θ) except
90°
, then its motion under gravity is a curved parabolic path, called
trajectory and its motion is called projectile motion.
• Examples:
 The motion of a bullet shot from the gun
 The motion of a rocket after burn-out
 The motion of a bomb dropped from a aeroplane etc.
Projectile Motion
• Properties of Projectile Motion
• If we drop a ball from a height and at the same time thrown
another ball in a horizontal direction, then both the balls would
strike the earth simultaneously at different places.



Circular Motion
• The motion of an object along a circular path is called circular motion.
• Circular motion with a constant speed is called uniform circular motion.
• The direction of motion at any point in circular motion is given by the
tangent to the circle at that point.
• In uniform circular motion, the velocity and acceleration both changes.
• In case of non-uniform circular motion, the speed changes from point to
point on the circular track.
• Centripetal Acceleration
 During circular motion an acceleration acts on the body towards the
centre, called centripetal acceleration. The direction of centripetal
acceleration is always towards the centre of the circular path.
• Force
 It is an external push or pull with can change or tries to change the
state of rest or of uniform motion. SI unit is newton (N) and CGS unit is
dyne. 1 N = 105 dyne.
 If sum of all the forces acting on a body is zero, then body is said to be
in equilibrium.
• Centripetal Force
 During circular motion a force always acts on the body towards
the centre of the circular path, called centripetal force.
 F=mv2/r=mω2r.
• Centrifugal Force
 In circular motion we experience that a force is acting on us in
opposite to the direction of centripetal force called centrifugal
force. This is an apparent force or imaginary force and also
called a pseudo force.
Applications of centripetal and centrifugal forces
• Cyclist inclined itself from vertical to obtain required centripetal
force. To take a safe turn cyclist slower down his speed and moves
on a path of larger radius.
• Roads are banked at turns to provide required centripetal force for
taking a turn.
• For taking turn on a curved road, the frictional force is acting
between the tyres of the vehicle and the road acts as centripetal
force.
Applications of centripetal and centrifugal forces
• If a bucket containing water is revolved fast in a vertical plane, the
water may not fall even when bucket is completely inverted
because a centrifugal force equal or greater than the weight of
water pushes the water to the bottom of the bucket.
• For orbital motion of electrons around the nucleus electrostatic
force of attraction is acting between the electrons and the nucleus
as centripetal force.
Applications of centripetal and centrifugal forces
• Cream is separated from milk when it is rotated in a vessel about
the same axis. During rotation lighter particles of cream experience
a lesser force than the heavier particles of milk.
• For revolution of the earth around the sun, gravitational force of
attraction between the earth and the sun acts as centripetal force.

Lakes of the World
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Lakes
• A lake is a body of water of considerable size, localized in a basin, that is
surrounded by land apart from a river or other outlet that serves to feed
or drain the lake.
• Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and
areas with ongoing glaciation.
• Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or
stream, which maintain a lake’s average level by allowing the drainage of
excess water
• Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by
evaporation or underground seepage or both. They are termed endorheic
lakes.
• The majority of lakes on Earth are fresh water, and most lie in the
Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes. Canada, Finland and Siberia
contain most of the fresh water lakes
Classification of Lakes
• Temporary lakes
 Lakes may exist temporarily filling up the small depressions of undulating ground
after a heavy shower.
 In this kind of lakes, Evaporation is greater than Precipitation. Example: Small lakes
of deserts.
• Permanent lakes
 In this kind of lakes, precipitation is greater than evaporation.
 Example: Great Lakes of North America, East African Rift Lakes.
• Fresh water lakes
 Most of the lakes in the world are fresh-water lakes fed by rivers and without
flowing streams e.g. Great Lakes of North America.
Classification of Lakes
• Saline lakes
 Salt lakes is an inland body of water situated in an arid or
semiarid region, having no outlet to the sea, and containing a
high concentration of dissolved salt.
 These lakes exist in regions of low precipitation and intense
evaporation. Because of intense evaporation, the concentration
of salts increases in the water body, turning them saline.
Example - Great Salt Lake of Utah, USA, Dead Sea etc.
Lakes Formed by Earth Movement
• Tectonic lakes
 Due to the warping (simple deformation),
subsidence (sliding downwards), bending
and fracturing (splitting) of the earth’s
crust, tectonic depressions occur.
 Such depressions give rise to lakes of
immense sizes and depths.
 They include Lake Titicaca, and
the Caspian Sea.
Lakes Formed by Earth Movement
• Rift valley lakes
• A rift valley is formed when two blocks of earth move
apart letting the ‘in between’ block slide downwards.
Or, it’s a sunken land between two parallel faults.
• These lakes include some of the oldest, deepest and
largest lakes around the globe.
• Due to faulting, a rift valley is formed by the sinking of
the land between two parallel faults, deep, narrow and
elongated in character.
• Water is collected in these troughs
• Often their floors are below sea level.
• The best example of this is the East African Rift Valley
which includes such lakes as Lake Tanganyika and the
Dead Sea etc.
Lakes Formed by Glaciation
• Cirque lakes or tarns
• A glacier on its way down the valley leaves behind
circular hollows.
• These circular hollows, in the heads of the valley up in
the mountain, are called cirques.
• Cirque is a hollow basin cut into a mountain ridge. It
has steep sided slope on three sides, an open end on
one side and a flat bottom.
• When the ice melts, the cirque may develop into a tarn
lake.
• They are also called as Ribbon lakes
• Example Red tarn in the English Lake District and
Chandra Taal (Himachal Pradesh) in India
Lakes Formed by Glaciation
• Rock-hollow lakes
• These lakes are formed by ice scouring when valley glaciers or ice sheets
scoop out hollows or depressions on the surface
• Such lakes are abundant in Finland
• Two more types of a glacial lake are formed due to damming up of valleys
by morainic debris deposited by valley glaciers and deposition of glacial
drifts in glaciated lowlands .
Lakes Formed by Volcanic Activity
• Crater and Caldera Lakes
• A natural hollow called a crater is formed by blowing off
of the top of the cone during a volcanic explosion.
• Crater may be widened and enlarged by further
subsidence into a caldera.
• In dormant or extinct volcanoes, due to rainfall straight
into these depressions which have no superficial outlet,
a crater or caldera lake is formed.
• Examples Lonar crater lake in Maharashtra, India, Crater
Lake in Oregon, USA and Lake Toba in Sumatra etc.
Lakes Formed by Volcanic Activity
• Lava-blocked Lakes
• In volcanic regions, it is common to find a stream
of lava that flows across a valley
• This stream of lava may occasionally become
solidified and block the valley thus forming a lake
basin
• This basin may get filled up due damming up of the
river due to solidified lava.
• Example The Sea of Galilee which is an inland lake
was created due to blocking of the Jordan valley by
lava flow
Lakes Formed by Erosion
• Karst lakes
• Karst lakes are formed in
depressions, carved out by solvent
action of rainwater on water-soluble
rocks such as limestone, gypsum and
dolomite.
• The collapse of limestone roofs of
underground caves may result in the
exposure of long, narrow lakes that
were once underground.
Lakes Formed by Erosion
• Wind-deflated lakes
 The winds in deserts creates hollows.
 These may reach ground water which seeps out forming small, shallow lakes.
 Excessive evaporation causes these to become salt lakes and playas.
 Example: Great Basin of Utah, U.S.A.
Lakes Formed by Deposition
• Lakes due to river deposits
 During a flood, a river may shorten its course by cutting across its meandering
loops, leaving behind a horse-shoe shaped channel as an ox-bow lake
 e.g. those that occur on the flood-plains of Lower Mississippi, Lower Ganges, USA
and Rio Grande (Mexico), Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary in Bihar, etc..
• Lakes due to Marine deposits
 Also called Lagoons. (shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water
by barrier islands or reefs. )
 Example: Lake Chilka
Lakes Formed by Deposition
• Lakes due to damming of water
 Lakes formed by these processes are also known as barrier lakes.
Landslides, avalanches may block valleys so that rivers are dammed.
Such lakes are short-lived.
 Example: Lakes that are formed in Shiwaliks (Outer Himalayas).
Dehradun (all Duns) were lakes few centuries ago.
Man-made lakes
• Artificial lakes
• Besides natural lakes, man has now
created artificial lakes
• Artificial lakes are created by erecting a
concrete dam across a river valley
• These dams help in creating a reservoir
by impounding river water
• Guru Gobind Sagar Lake which supports
the Bhakra Nangal Hydel Project is an
example of an artificial lake in India

Introduction
• Land under settlements (i.e. rural and urban), infrastructure (i.e. roads,
canals, industries, shops, etc.) are kept under the category of NonAgricultural Land.
• Barren hilly terrains, desert lands, ravines, etc. normally are not suitable
for cultivation, hence, they are known as Barren and Wastelands.
• Any land, which is left fallow (uncultivated) for more than five years is
categorized as Cultivable land.
Introduction
• The land, which is left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural
year is known as Current Fallow.
• The physical extent of the land on which crops are sown and harvested is
known as Net Sown Area.
• Land use pattern changes with time and the nature of economic activities
carried out in that region. As a result of increase in population, change in
income levels, available technology, and associated factors, pressure on land
increases and marginal lands come under use.
Introduction
• When secondary and tertiary sectors grow much faster than primary
sector, then agricultural land changes into non-agricultural land.
• Because of the changing structure of the Indian economy, the rate of
increase of non-agricultural land is very fast.
Grouping of Minerals
On the basis of chemical and physical properties,
minerals are grouped as:
Metallic minerals
Non-metallic minerals
• Metallic minerals are further sub-divided as ferrous and nonferrous metallic minerals
• The minerals containing iron is known as ferrous and without iron
is known as non-ferrous (copper, bauxite etc)
• Depending upon the origination, non-metallic minerals are either
organic (such as fossil fuels also known as mineral fuels, which are
derived from the buried animal and plant)
• Minerals are unevenly distributed on the earth’s surface
• All minerals are exhaustible in nature

) can be used for making nitrogen based
fertilizers e.g. Urea
• Similarly, Neptha (obtained from crude oil) is also used in
production of nitrogen based fertilizers, hence proximity to oil
refinery is also considered a favourable factor.

Energy Crisis
A situation in which resources are less than the demand
In the past few decades due to high demand, there is shortage of
energy resources, which has created energy crisis
Major causes for Energy Crisis:
Rapid Industrialization
Over Population
Transfer losses
Rise in oil prices
Problems in Middle east
Wastage of energy resources
Electricity in India
Thermal
Hydro Wind
Nuclear
Thermal Energy
• 67 % of total energy production
• Generated by using fossil fuels (Coal, Petroleum, Natural gas)
• No Geological conditions required
• Limited reserves, Rising demands (cost) & non – ecofriendly
• Largest Producer → Maharashtra
• To boost Thermal power production gov. has promoted Ultra
Mega Power Projects (4000 MW & above)
Hydroelectricity
• 18 % of total energy production
• Eco-friendly, Clean & Renewable
• Small hydel power projects < 25 MW are counted under New
renewable energy sources
• Largest Producer → Andhra Pradesh
Nuclear Energy
• 26 % of total energy production
• Energy obtained from atomic minerals viz. Uranium,
Thorium, zircon, beryllium
• Thorium → Found as monazite sand in lakes & sea beds
• Thorium → AP > TN > Kerala > Orissa constitutes 30 % of
world reserves
• Largest Producer → Tamil Nadu
Nuclear Energy
• Essential minerals used for the generation of nuclear energy are uranium
and thorium.
• Geographically, uranium ores are found at many different locations along
the Singbhum Copper belt.
• Other important uranium reserve regions are also found in Udaipur, Alwar,
and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan; Durg district of Chhattisgarh;
Bhandara district of Maharashtra; and Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh.
Nuclear Energy
• Palakkad and Kollam districts of Kerala have the world’s largest monazite
deposits
• Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1948 and the Atomic
Energy Institute at Trombay was founded in 1954.
• However, the Atomic Energy Institute at Trombay was renamed as Bhabha
Atomic Research Centre in 1967.
• The important nuclear power projects are located at Tarapur
(Maharashtra); Rawatbhata near Kota (Rajasthan); Kalpakkam (Tamil
Nadu); Narora (Uttar Pradesh); Kaiga (Karnataka); and Kakarapara
(Gujarat).
Wind Energy
Non-conventional Renewable source of energy
Largest Producer → Tamil Nadu
High cost as compared to the efficiency of power generated
Nagercoil (TN) and Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) are well known for
effective use of wind energy in the country
Solar Energy
• Non-conventional Renewable source of energy
• Thermal + Photovoltaic → Sunlight to energy
• High cost as compared to the efficiency of power generated
• India plans to generate 100GW of solar energy by 2022
• The largest solar plant of India is located at Madhavpur, near
Bhuj, where solar energy is used to sterilise milk cans.
Solar Energy
• The western part of India has greater potential for the
development of solar energy.
• The Ministry of Non-conventional Sources of Energy is
responsible for the development of wind energy in
India as the major source of renewable energy.
Bio Energy
• Bio-energy is the energy derived usually from the biological
products, such as agricultural residues and other bio-waste.
• Bio-energy can be converted into electrical energy, heat
energy, and gas for cooking.
• Okhla in Delhi presents a good example by producing bio
energy from municipal waste.
Bio Gas
• Converted into energy by direct combustion or by conversion of
such wastages into alcohol, methane, or other storage fuels
• Provides pollution-free energy
• Cheaper than most of the common fuels
• The residue can be used as manure
• Has higher thermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene, cow dung,
coal and charcoal
Tidal Energy
• Non-conventional Renewable source of energy
• Oceanic tides can be used to generate electricity.
• In India, the Gulf of Kutch, provides ideal conditions for utilising
tidal energy.
• Ocean currents are the store-house of infinite energy. Hence, India
has great potential for the development of tidal energy.
Geo Thermal Energy
• Refers to the heat and electricity produced by using the heat from the interior
of the Earth
• Exists because, the Earth grows progressively hotter with increasing depth
• Groundwater in such areas absorbs heat from the rocks and becomes hot.
• It is so hot that when it rises to the earth’s surface, it turns into steam.
• This steam is used to drive turbines and generate electricity.
• Parvati valley near Manikarn in Himachal Pradesh and Puga Valley, Ladakh

(Industries,Nuclear Reactors
and MPPs)
By Dr Vipan
Goyal
India: Industry
Primary Industries
Use natural raw material
Examples → Hunting-gathering, pastoral activities, fishing,
forestry, agriculture, mining and quarrying
Secondary Industries
• Make complex products using the material obtained from
primary industry
• Secondary Industry can be sub classified into
• Heavy Industries → Engineering, metal goods, heavy
chemicals, shipbuilding, locomotives
• Light industries → Electronics, plastic, textile, cosmetic etc.
Tertiary Industries
Not a branch of manufacturing but sells the product of primary and
secondary industries via transport, trading, wholesale & retailing
Basically include Service providers industry
Provides services such as tourism, education, entertainment,
advertisements, consultancy, Administration, healthcare etc.
Factors responsible for the location of Industries
Availability of Raw Material
Power Resources
Availability of water
Labor
Transportation
Availability of Market
Capital
Government Policies
Need for Industrialization in India
To reduce dependence on the other countries and become self sufficient
To maintain the balance of trade
To accelerate the economic growth
To solve the problem of unemployment
Industries polluting the environment
Emitting Harmful Effluents and Smoke into the Air
Discharging Large Quantities of Chemical Waste and Garbage
Degradation of fertile Land
Contamination of Underground Water
Solutions
• Use of Hydro-Electricity instead of thermal power
• Use of Higher Quality Coal for Thermal Plants emitting less smoke
• Shifting of Factories out of Municipal Limits
• Discharging dirty water & smoke only after treatment
• Recycling of industrial Water
• Enacting Stringent Laws for checking Pollution and Degradation of
the Environment
• Planting of Trees and Creating Mini-Forest Areas by Industry owners
Timber industry
Near raw material
Dependent on bamboo, softwood
E.g. South Gujarat, Odisha, MP
Near market
Kolkata → Raw material brought from North Eastern
States, cheap labor, coal, water available
Fishing in India
In India, fishing is more developed along western coast than in
Eastern coast because
• Continental shelf in Western Coast are wider so they
have more plankton and results in more fishes
• Commercial varieties like Prawns are mostly confined along
western coast.
Cotton and Textile Industry
location :
• nearness to market
• nearness to water body (for dyeing, bleaching)
• Energy to run power looms and textile machines
• cheap labour supply & availability of capital/finance
Climate as factor for cotton factories
• In dry climate, the cotton-threads will break quickly during spinning.
• In humid climate, thread will rarely break.
• So, cotton textiles were setup near coastal areas.
• Today we have humidifiers that can artificially increase the airmoisture in factory/work-shed so we can setup factory anywhere,
run it efficiently, irrespective of climate outside.
Cotton Industry locations in India
• Tamil Nadu has the largest number of cotton
textiles in India
Maharashtra (Mumbai – Cottonopolish of India)
Ahmadabad (Gujarat)
Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) Manchester of South India
Silk Industry
• India grows all important varieties of silk viz. Mulberry, Tasar, Oak Tasar, Eri
and Muga
• But demand is greater than production, so even we have to import from
china (particularly mulberry silk)
• Mulberry silk concentrated Mainly in Southern states (Karnataka, Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh) + WB + J & K
• Non – Mulberry states Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha + North East
• Location of silk Industry is governed by 2 factors- prevalence of sericulture
practices and availability of skilled labour.
• Karnataka is leading producer followed by West Bengal and Bihar.
Geographical Factors
• Raw material (Mulberry plants) can be grown in any type of
soil even in forest fringes, hill slopes
• Works well in non-green revolution, non-irrigated areas of
East and NE India
• In Eastern States, Farmers earlier used to grow Jute but Jute
demand declined so they shifted to Sericulture
Woolen Industry
• Market
 Winter in North India → brutally cold hence good demand
 ~75% of industries concentrated in Northern States
because of market factor
 Parallel to wool-market factor, you can see that Cotton
textile industry is profound in southern half of India
because warm-humid climate hence more demand for
Cotton garments in south India than woolen
Indian woolen textile regions
Jute Industry
• India manufactures the largest quantity of jute
goods in the world.
• Mainly located in West Bengal followed by
Andra Pradesh, Bihar, UP and MP.
• After independence most of the jute-producing areas went to
Bangladesh resulting in acute shortage of raw jute (raw material
required for Jute production)
• Indian Jute industry is facing very stiff competition from other jute
producing countries viz. Bangladesh, Philippines, Japan and Brazil
Viticulture
• winegrowing (wine growing) is the cultivation
and harvesting of grapes.
• Himachal, Nashik and Bangalore.
Rubber Plantations
• Natural Rubber is obtained from latex of
rubber trees
• Latex is white milky liquid, collected by
making cut on rubber tree bark
• Latex contains 30-40% rubber
Nature of Raw Material

Land Revenue Systems
Before British Rule
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Land Revenue Systems Before British Rule
• Tax from the land was a major source of revenue for the kings and
emperors from ancient times.
• But the ownership pattern of land had witnessed changes over
centuries.
• During Kingship, land was divided into Jagirs, Jagirs were alloted
to Jagirdars, these Jagirdars split the land they got and allocated to
sub-ordinate Zamindars.
• Zamindars made peasants cultivate the land, in-return collected
part of their revenue as tax.
Land Revenue Systems in British India
• Three major systems of land revenue collection existed in
India.
• They were
1. Zaminidari,
2. Ryotwari and
3. Mahalwari.
Permanent Settlement/Zamindari System
• It was initiated by Governor General Lord Cornwallis on the
recommendations of John Shore.
• It was implemented in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Banaras of
UP and North Karnataka
• It was implemented in 19% of the British areas.
• Cornwallis termed zamindars as the real owners of the land
• It was started only for a temporary period of 10 years in 1790, however
this system was made permanent in 1793
Permanent Settlement/Zamindari System
• The realized amount would be divided into 11 parts.
• 1/11 of the share belongs to Zamindars and 10/11 of the share belongs to
East India Company.
• The condition was that if a zamindar was not able to pay some part, he
was deprived of his Zamindari.
• At the same time, the zamindar had to pay his revenue rigidly on the due
date even if the crop had failed for some reason; otherwise his lands were
to be sold.
Benefits of Permanent Settlement
• Stability of income to britishers.
• Enabled the Company to maximize its income as land revenue
was now fixed higher than it had ever been in the past.
• Collection of revenue through a small number of zamindars
seemed to be much simpler and cheaper than the process of
dealing with lakhs of cultivators.
Ryotwari
• It was started in 1792 by Col. Charles Reed
• Thomas Munroe improvised this system in 1820
• Major areas of introduction include Madras, Bombay, parts of Assam
and Coorgh provinces of British India.
• Major fault in this system was the excessive land tax.
• Peasants were the owners of their land
• Peasants were directly responsible to give revenue
• It was implemented in 51% of the British areas
• The revenue rates of Ryotwari System were 50% where the lands were
dry and 60% in irrigated land.
Impact of Ryotwari system
• Even while the position of cultivator became more secure, but the rigid
system of revenue collection forced ryots into the hands of moneylender.
• Since the government itself became a big zamindar, it had right to
enhance revenue at will.
• The cultivator was left at the mercy of the collecting officers.
Mahalwari
• It was started by Holt Mckenzie
• Mahalwari system was introduced in 1833 during the period of William Bentick.
• It was introduced in Central Province, North-West Frontier, Agra, Punjab, Gangetic Valley,
etc of British India.
• Unit of land tax was known as ‘Mahal’. Under this ‘Mahal’, one or more villages could
join
• It was implemented on 30% area.
• The rate of land under this system was very high
• Only cash was accepted under this system and Ownership rights were vested with the
peasants.
• The villages committee was held responsible for collection of the taxes.
Impact of Mahalwari System
• Since the government revised the revenue periodically, the
peasants had not much benefit of elimination of middlemen
between the government and the village.
• This brought about some improvement in irrigation facilities,
though major benefits of the system were largely enjoyed by
the government.
Impact of Land Revenue System:
Land Tenure System
• These land settlements introduced a market economy and removed customary
rights.
• With cash payments of revenue, there was increased money-lending activity.
• The Land tenure system sharpened social differentiation.
• While rich had access to the courts to defend their properties, the poor didn’t
have any resources.
• The peasants were forced to grow commercial crops which led them to buy
food grains at higher prices and sell the cash crops at low prices.
• The land revenue system of British in India shook the stability of Indian villages
where majority of the people depended on agriculture and related activities.
They became miserable if crop failed in any given year.

Laws of Motion
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Newton’s Laws of Motion
• Newton’s First Law
 A body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a
straight line unless an external force acts on it. It is based on law
of inertia.
 Inertia is the property of a body by virtue of which is opposes
any change in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight
line.
Newton’s First Law
• Inertia of Rest
 When a bus or train at rest starts, to move suddenly, the
passengers sitting in it jerk in backward direction due to their
inertia of rest.
 The dust particles come out from a carpet when it is beaten
with a stick due to their inertia of rest.
 A passenger jumping out from a rapidly moving bus or train is
advised to jump in forward direction and run forward for a short
mile due to inertia of rest.
Newton’s First Law
• Inertia of Motion
 When a running bus or train stops suddenly, the passengers
sitting in it jerk in forward direction due to inertia of motion
• Momentum
 The momentum of a moving body is equal to the product of its
mass and its velocity.
Newton’s First Law
• Conservation of Linear Momentum
 The linear momentum of a system of particles remains
conserved if the external force acting on the system is zero.
 Rocket propulsion and engine of jet aeroplane works on
principle of conservation of linear momentum.
 In rocket, ejecting gas exerts a forward force which helps in
accelerating the rocket upward.
Newton’s Second Law
• The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional
to the force applied on it and change in momentum takes place in
the direction of applied force.
Newton’s Third Law
• For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction and both
act on two interacting objects.
• Rocket is propelled by the principle of Newton’s third law of
motion.
Impulse
• A large force which acts on a body for a very short interval of time
and produces a large change in its momentum is called an impulsive
force.
• Its unit is newton-second.
• A fielder lowers its hand when catching a cricket ball because by
lowering his hands, he increases the time of contact for stopping
the ball and therefore fielder has to apply lesser force to stop the
ball. The ball will also exert lesser force on the hands of the fielder
and the fielder will not get hurt.
• Wagons of a train are provided with the buffers to increase the time
of impact during jerks and therefore, decreases the damage.
• The vehicles like scooter, car, bus, truck etc. are provided with
shockers.
Friction
• Friction is a force which opposes the relative motion of the two
bodies when one body actually moves or tries to move over the
surface of another body.
• The cause of friction is the strong atomic or molecular forces of
attraction acting on the two surfaces at the point of actual contact.
Uses of Friction
• A ball bearing is a type of rolling-element that uses balls to
maintain the separation between the bearing races. The purpose of
a ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and to support loads
(weight).
• Friction can be decreases by polishing the surfaces by using
lubricants or by using ball bearings.
• Tyres are made of synthetic rubber because its coefficient or
friction with road is larger and therefore, large force of friction acts
on it, which stops sliding at turns.
Uses of Friction
• The tyres are threading which also increases the friction between
the tyres and the road.
• When pedal is applied to a bicycle, the force of friction on rear
wheel is in forward direction and on front wheel is in the backward
direction.
Loses due to Friction
• Too much Loss of Energy in machines and then ultimately the
machines are damaged.
Machine
• Lever - It is a simple machine in which a straight or inclined rod is
made to turn or rotate at a point freely or independently. There are
three points related to lever namely load, effort and fulcrum.
• Load - The weight carried by the lever is called load.
• Effort - To operate lever, the force applied externally is called effort.
• Fulcrum - The fixed point about which the rod of lever moves
independently is called fulcrum.

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
By Dr Vipan Goyal

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
 Human digestive system
 The Alimentary Canal
 The Esophagus
 Stomach
 Enzymes in Stomach
 Small Intestine
 Large Intestine
HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Definition : The process of reducing food
into smaller molecules that can be
absorbed into the body is called digestion.
Major Organs
 Mouth
 Esophagus
 Stomach
 Small Intestine
 Large Intestine.
Accessory Organs:
 Liver
 Gallbladder
 Pancreas.


THE ALIMENTARY CANAL
The Alimentary Canal
 Ingestion: The process of taking substances into
the body through the mouth.
 Digestion: The breakdown of large, insoluble
food molecules into small water soluble
molecules using mechanical and chemical
processes.
 Absorption: The movement of digestive food
molecules through the wall of the intestine into
the blood or lymph.
 Assimilation: The movement of digestive food
molecules into the cells of the body where they
are used, becoming part of the cells.
 Egestion: The passing out of the food that has
not been digested, as passes , through the anus
THE MOUTH
The Mouth: The first part of the
digestive system. The Entry point of
food.
Structures in the mouth that aids digestion are
• Teeth (cut, tear, crush and grind food)
• Salivary glands–Produce and secrete saliva into the
oral cavity.
Saliva:
It moistens the food, contains enzymes
(ptyalin or salivary amylase). The beginning of
digestion of starch into smaller polysaccharides.
Function:
 Mechanical digestion.
 Increasing surface area for faster chemical
digestion
THE ESOPHAGUS
Esophageal sphincter:
Bolus reaches the stomach must pass
through a muscular ringed valve called the
esophageal sphincter(Cardiac Sphincter).
Function: Prevent stomach acids from back
flowing into the esophagus.
The Esophagus:
A tube connecting the mouth to the stomach,
running through the thoracic cavities. It lies
behind wind pipe (trachea).
The trachea has as an epiglottis, preventing
food from entering the wind pipe, moving the
food to the esophagus while swallowing food
travels down the esophagus, through a series of
involuntary rhythmic contractions (wave-like)
called peristalsis.
Function:
The lining of the esophagus secretes mucus,
lubricating to support the movement of food.
STOMACH
Stomach : J- shaped muscular
sac, has inner folds (rugae),
increasing surface area of the
stomach.
Function:
Stomach performs mechanical
digestion, by churning the bolus
and mixing it with the gastric
juices, secreted by the lining of
the stomach.
Gastric juices:
It contains HCl, salts, enzymes, water and
mucus. HCl helps breakdown of food and kills
bacteria that come along with the food. The
bolus is now called chyme.
ENZYMES IN STOMACH
Enzymes in stomach (acidic environment):
HCl secreation, kill any microbes that are found in the
bolus, creating a pH of 2. Mucus prevents the stomach
from digesting itself.
Pepsin secreation
It is responsible for initiating the breakdown of proteins in
food, hydrolyzes proteins to yield polypeptides (peptones).
Proteins to peptones
At pH 2, the enzyme from the salivary glands stops
breaking down carbohydrates.
Pyloric sphincter:
Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. It
passes through a muscular ringed sphincter called the
pyloricsphincter.
How stomach does not digest itself?
Three protective mechanisms:-
First the stomach only secretes small
amounts of gastric juices until food is
present.
Second the secretion of mucus coats the
lining of the stomach protecting it from
the gastric juices.
The third mechanism is the digestive
enzyme pepsin is secreted in an inactive
protein called pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is
converted to pepsin in the increased
presence of hydrochloric acid (Ph1).
SMALL INTESTINE
Small Intestine
It is responsible for the complete digestion of all macro molecules, and the
absorption of their component molecules. It contains a finger like projection
villi which increases the surface area of small intestine. Food can stay 4 to 8
hours in the small intestine.
Parts of small Intestine
The small intestine is made up of
three parts :
 Duodenum
 Jejunum (no digestion)
 Ileum (no digestion)
DUODENUM
1.Duodenum
The first part is the
duodenum, u-shaped
organ, approximately 30
cm in length. This area
completes most of the
digestion processes.
Enzymes are secreted in to
the duodenum form the
pancreas, gall bladder and
intestinal juice. It is located
between the stomach and
the middle part of the
small intestine, or jejunum.
Pancreas :
It is located behind stomach and produces insulin
and glucagon. These two hormones maintains the
glucose level in the blood through feedback
mechanism. It secretes pancreatic juice containing
proteases, pancreatic amylase and lipase.
Proteases (pepsin, trypsin
and chymotrypsin) Converts
proteins into peptides into
amino acids.
Pancreatic amylase Converts
starch to amylase Lipase
Converts fats into fatty acid
and glycerol.
DUODENUM
Bile juice :
It is produced by liver, stored in the
gall bladder. The bile salts emulsify
fats and break them into smaller
globules which are easily digestible
by lipase.
Liver :
It is a factory for antibodies and
bile, helps in breaking down of fats,
emulsification of fats. It stores
vitamins and sugars until your body
needs them.
Gallbladder :
The storage tank for bile (a greenish- yellow
liquid that helps your body break down and use
fats), located in liver and shaped like a pear
DUODENUM
Intestinal juice :
The epithelial cells of the villi
produce enzymes which complete
the breakdown of:
Maltose to glucose
Peptides to amino acids
Fats to fatty acid and glycerol
2 Jejunum
The jejunum is approximately 2.5 m long.
Although some digestion is completed
here, it has more villi and microvilli; its role
is absorption of nutrients.
3 Ileum
The ileum, is approximately 3m long,has
fewer villi and microvilli than the other
two parts. Although absorption also occurs
here, it is responsible for pushing the
waste materials into the large intestine.
LARGE INTESTINE
Components of large Intestine
The large intestine contains water with
undigested matter, cellulose and fibre
that digested partly by bacteria. It is
composed of several distinctive parts:
Cecum:
Contains beta cellulose enzyme, absent
in human body.
Colon:
The colon consists off our parts:
ascending colon, transverse colon,
descending colon, sigmoid colon. It
contains coliform group of bacterias and
this type of bacterias are useful to check
the water contamination.
Glucose:
It is stored in the form of glycogen in liver and
muscles in animals while in plants, it is stored in
starch.

Nutrition
By Dr Vipan Goyal

NUTRITION
• The process of digestion and absorption of foods and
the body’s use of it for growth and replacement of
cells.
• SIX BASIC NUTRIENTS
• 1. Carbohydrates 2. Proteins 3. Fats 4. Vitamins 5.
Minerals 6. Water
• CARBOHYDRATES: made up of C,H,O in the ratio 1:2:1
• Types of carbohydrates:
• 1. Simple sugars – monosaccharide-single sugar.
a. Glucose – blood sugar sugars are a poor source
b. Fructose – mostly fruits, berries of energy.
c. Galactose – does not occur free in and cause an insulin nature, it is always bonded
to something else
2. Compound sugars – disaccharide – two sugar units
a. Sucrose – sugar cane and sugar beets
b. Maltose – germinating seeds
c. Lactose – milk sugar
• 3. Complex carbohydrate (starch) – polysaccharide – many sugar units
• a. Whole grains
• b. Fruits
• c. Vegetables
• Carbohydrates as energy:
• 1. Glucose is the blood sugar.
• 2. Excess glucose is stored in the body as glycogen.
• a. Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles.
• b. The body can store about ½ day supply of glycogen for energy.

Proteins
• It contains C, H, O, N
• They are made up of amino acids. So amino acids are called building blocks of Protein.
• Functions of Protein
• Proteins play multiple functions in the body and its structure gives it its functionality. Some prominent
functions are:-
• Digestion – Digestion is carried out by the digestive enzymes which are basically proteinaceous in nature.
• Movement – Myosin is a protein found in muscles which enables the contraction of muscles making
movement possible.
• Structure and Support – Keratin is the structural protein which makes our hair, nails, and horns in animals.
• Cellular communication – Cells communicate with other cells and the external environment via receptors
present on the surface of cells. These receptors are made of proteins.
• Act as a messenger – These proteins function as the chemical messengers, which help in the
communication between the cells, tissues, and organs.
Protein
Structure

FATS
• Made up of C,H,O ( oxygen is less than the carbohydrates)
• Fats contain about 9 calories per gram twice as many carbohydrates or
protein.
• Function: (add flavor and help satisfy hunger).
• 1.Body’s storage form for food energy eaten in excess of need.
• 2.Insulates the body.
• 3.Cushions vital body organs.
• 4.Transports fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).
• Types of fats
• 1.Saturated fats – solid or semisolid at room temperature. A fatty acid carrying the maximum
possible number of hydrogen atoms.
• Source – mostly from animal products – meats, poultry, fish, milk, cheese and eggs.
• 1.Vegetable oils high in saturated fats
• a.Palm oil – 50% saturated
• b.Palm kernel oil
• c.Coconut oil – 92% saturated
• Raise cholesterol levels in the blood as well as LDL (bad cholesterol). They add texture and
are more chemically stable to heat.
• 2.Polyunsaturated fats – liquid at room temperature. A fatty acid that has two or more
hydrogen bonds missing. Source – mostly from plants.
• Lowers cholesterol, but also slightly lowers HDL (good cholesterol). They supply essential
fatty acids.
• Monounsaturated fats – liquid at room temperature
• Source – mostly from plants (olive oil & peanut oil)
• Canola oil had both polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.
• Fish Oils – Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that come from fish. They don’t
have much effect on cholesterol.They lower the total amount of fat in the blood
(reduce triglycerides). They help prevent blood clots.
• Trans fatty acids – the process of adding hydrogen to unsaturated fats to make it
more solid and resistant to chemical change.
• Causes it to lose its polyunsaturated character and health benefits.
• Example: Butter – Margarine (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil).
• Two types of cholesterol
• a.Low – Density Lipoproteins – LDL – bad cholesterol
• 1. Fat in the blood stream that is on its way to cell for storage. (including
the cells that line the artery walls)
• 2. Saturated fat causes the body to produce LDL.
• b.High – Density Lipoproteins – HDL – good cholesterol
• 1. Fat in the bloodstream that is in route to the liver where it is processed
and excreted from the body.
• 2. HDL works to minimize the harmful effects of LDL by causing it to be
removed from the bloodstream and excreted.
VITAMINS
Main functions:-
Vitamins are essential to the body:
 To maintain health
 To help prevent deficiency diseases such as
beriberi (weakened muscles, heart, nerves
and digestive system) and rickets (softening
of the bones)
 To regulate the repair of body cells to help
combat the ageing process
 To help to process carbohydrates and release
energy in the body.
Vitamins are of two types:
 Water soluble vitamins- B, C
 Fat soluble vitamins – A, D, E, K
Vitamins are made up of carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen. Vitamins are called micronutrients
because they are needed in only very small
quantities Vitamins are made up of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen. Vitamins are called
micronutrients because they are needed in only
very small quantities.
VITAMINS
Water soluble
 Cannot be stored in body, regular
supply needed.
 Excess is excreted in urine – no
danger of toxic levels
 Unstable to heat and light, leach
into cooking liquids.
Fat soluble
 Can be stored in body – regular
supply not needed
 Can accumulate to toxic levels if
large amounts ingested.
 Fairly stable at normal cooking
temperature.

MINERALS
Minerals : Our body requires mineral elements for a variety of functions. They are also known
as micronutrients. Unlike vitamins, which are organic substances minerals are inorganic and
are found in rocks and soil. Vegetables absorb minerals as they grow, while animals digest it
through their diet. Minerals can be divided into two groups – those needed in larger
quantities (major minerals) and those only required in tiny amounts(trace elements).
1. Trace minerals – are iron, zinc and iodine.
2. Major minerals – are sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorous. Minerals have four
major functions: Body building : Teeth and bones
Control of body processes, especially the nervous system.
Essential part of body fluids and cells.( Potassium in intracellular fluid and Sodium in
extracellular fluid)
Form part of body fluids and cells.
Form part of enzymes and other proteins necessary for the release of energy.
MINERALS
SODIUM
Functions: Maintains water
balance in the body and
controls body temperature,
helps you sweat when body
temperature rises.
Sources: Cheese, bacon,
smoked meats, fish,
processed foods, table salt.
Government advice says an
average you should be
eating no more than 6g of
salt a day.

spasm
GOITRE
 The most common cause of goitre is Iodine
deficiency. It is one of the leading causes of
hypothyroidism.
 Hyperthyroidism (Overactive thyroid gland):
Goitre can develop if the thyroid gland becomes
overactive (hyperthyroidism), leading to too much
thyroid hormones being produced. Increased
hormone production will over-stimulate the thyroid
gland and causes it to enlarge. The leading cause of
hyperthyroidism is Graves’ disease. Graves’ disease
causes immune system (the body’s natural defense
system) to send antibodies (proteins that fight
infections) to the thyroid gland. The antibodies
stimulate the thyroid gland, causing an increased
amount of thyroid hormones to be released.
 Hyporthyroidism (Underactive
thyroid gland): Goitre can also
develop if the thyroid gland becomes
underactive (hypothyroidism).
Underactive thyroid gland does not
produce enough thyroid hormones,
the body will stimulate it to produce
more. This can cause the thyroid
gland to enlarge. Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease
causing hypothyroidism.

Excretory System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Organs that play role in excretion:
Lungs
Skin
Liver
Kidney
The Lungs
• It helps in gaseous exchage.
• Inhale of O2 and exhale of Co2
Excretion through skin
• Sweat, which is excreted through the skin, contains
water, salts and some urea. As the water in the sweat is
excreted, heat is lost and the body is cooled.
• Sweat is a form of excretion as it rids the body of waste,
as well as a form of secretion as it maintains the body
temperature through sebaceous glands or sweat
glands.
• The Excretory systems maintain homeostasis with
respect to water, salt and metabolite concentrations
within the blood.
The liver
• The liver removes metabolic wastes.
• Makes ureas from N2 to NH3 and then Urea
through ornithine cycle.
Excretion through kidney
• When proteins are broken down in humans, a compound called ammonia (NH3) is
formed. Ammonia is highly toxic, so it is converted into urea by the liver, and this
urea is the primary nitrogenous waste found in urine.
• Other waste products excreted in the urine include Uric acid (from breakdown of
DNA and RNA) and Creatinine (from muscle action).
Excretion through kidney
The following substances are made in the liver and excreted by the
kidneys:
• Urea, the main nitrogenous waste compound secreted. It is formed
by the breakdown of excess amino acids in the process of
deamination.
• Uric acid, the nitrogenous end product of nucleic acid metabolism.
Creatinine is formed from creatinine phosphate, found in the muscle
cells.
• Non- nitrogenous waste, Eg: CO2
, Excess water, ions, harmones,
poisons and drugs.
The Urinary System
The main function of the urinary system is
to maintain homeostatis by regulating
the volume and concentration of body
fluids.
It filters and reabsorbs certain materials
from the blood.
The urinary system is made up of the
following parts:
Kidneys: Two organs that filter blood to
remove waste (which is excreted
inurine) and adjusts the concentration
of salts in the blood.
Ureters: Either of a pair of ducts
that carry urine from the
kidneys to the bladder.
Urinary bladder: Stores urine until
it can be excreted.
Urethra: The tube through which
urine exits the bladder.
Nephron
The functional unit of the kidney is the Nephron.
Each kidney contains about 1 million or so
Nephrons.
The Parts of the Nephron
• Glomerulus
• Bowman’s Capsule
• Proximal Tubule
• Loop of Henle
• Distal Tubule
• Collecting Duct
• Glomerulus: The blood vessel inside the
Bowman’s capsule from which water, salts,
nutrient molecules, and waste molecules
leave the blood to be filtered by the kidney.
• Bowman’s capsule: The receiving end of a
renal (kidney) tubule at which water and
small solutes from the blood enter the
proximal tubule from the glomerulus.
• Proximal tubule: The tube between the
Bowman’s capsule and the loop of Henle.
Reabsorption of important nutrients like
water, glucose, and amino acids begins here.
• loop of Henle: The long loop of the nephron
that extends into the medulla of the kidney
between the proximal tubule and the distal
tubule. The main function of the loop of
Henle is to remove water from the filtrate.
• Distal tubule: The tube that connects the
loop of Henle to the collecting duct. The
main job of the distal tubule is to secrete
material like hydrogen ions, creatinine,and
drugs out of the blood into the filtrate.
• Collecting ducts: Carries urine to renal
pelvis.
• WATER and OTHER COMPONENTS IN URINE
• About 96% of urine is water, 1.5% is salts, mainly sodium chloride, urea makes up to
2%. Small quantities of drugs, harmones and preservatives. About 1.5 litres of urine is
produced daily.
• The amount of water found in urine depends on the permeability of the distal tubule
and the collecting duct. This permeability is controlled by a hormone (chemical
messenger) called anti- diuretic hormone (ADH). ADH increases permeability, which
allows the body to reabsorb water so it doesn’t go out in urine.
• If you drink a lot of fluid, ADH is not produced so the kidneys do not reabsorb the
water. As well, certain drugs like alcohol and caffeine blockthe release of ADH and
increase urine volume.
• Chemicals in urine precipitate and form crystals, mostly calcium oxalate.
ANIMALS AND EXCRETORY PARTS
• Unicellular Animals / Ameoba – by diffusion through surface of the body.
• Platyhelminthes/ Flatworms – by Flame cells
• Round worms/Earthworms – by Nephridia
• Arthropods/ Cockroaches – by Malphigian tubules
• Crustaceans / Prawns - Antennal glands / Green Glands
• Vertebrates –kidney
• Kidney stone
• More common in men than women.
• Factors that cause stones include urinary tract infections,
insufficient water intake, low. activity level, and/or too much
vitamin C or D.
• Symptoms include severe pain, blood in the urine, nausea.
Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)
• Kidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted blood
flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of poisonous
wastes in the body, which can even lead to death.
• In case of kidney failure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to
remove nitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.
• Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended in a
tank filled with dialysing fluid. This fluid has the same osmotic pressure as blood, except that
it is devoid of nitrogenous wastes. The patient’s blood is passed through these tubes.
• During this passage, the waste products from the blood pass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.
The purified blood is pumped back into the patient. This is similar to the function of the
kidney, but it is different since there is no reabsorption involved.
• Normally, in a healthy adult, the initial filtrate in the kidneys is about 180 L daily. However,
the volume actually excreted is only a litre or two a day, because the remaining filtrate is
reabsorbed in the kidney tubules.
Thank You
LIGHT
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Light
• Light is a form of energy, which is propagated as electromagnetic wave. (The waves of
energy are called electromagnetic (EM) because they have oscillating electric and
magnetic fields.)
• Light has a dual nature. It behaves as wave and particle both.
• Acc. to wave theory: light consist of electromagnetic waves, which do not require
material medium to travel.
• Acc. to particle theory: light is composed of particles which travels in a straight line at a
very high speed.
• For e.g: The phenomenon of diffraction, interference and polarization of light can only be
explained if light is considered to be of wave nature. The particle theory of light cannot
explain this phenomenon.
• The phenomenon of reflection and refraction of light, and casting of shadows of objects
by the light can be explained only if it is thought to be made up of particles. Wave theory
of light cannot explain this phenomenon.
Light
• Speed of light was first measured by Roemer.
• It is the radiation which make our eyes able to 'see the object.
Its speed is 3 x 108 m/s. It is the form of energy. It is a
transverse wave.
• It takes 8 min 19s to reach on the earth from the sun and the
light reflected from moon takes 1.28s to reach earth.
• Primary Colours- Blue, Red, Green
• Secondary Colours- The coloured produced my mixing any
two primary colors. E.g. Yellow, Magenta and Cyan(Peacock
Blue)
• Complementary Colours- Any two colours when added
produce white light. Red+ Cyan= White, Blue+Yellow=White
• PRISM: VIBGYOR
• Phenomenon of 7 colors through prism is called
Dispersion of Light.
• Wavelength of violet colour is minimum and red
colour is maximum.
• Deviation of light in prism depends on
wavelength and its refractive index.
• Violet colour shows maximum deviation on
passing white light through prism.
• Red Colour has longest wavelength and low
frequency and low refractive index.
Human Eye
• Eye forms the real image of the objects on the retina.
• Ciliary muscles change the focal length of eye lens. This power of eye is called
Accommodation of eye.
• Least distance of distinct vision is 25 cm.
• Myopia or short sightedness- far objects cannot see clear. Concave lens are used.
• Hyperopia or hypermetropia or Long-sightedness- Near objects cannot see clear.
Convex lens are used.
• Presbyopia- in elder person, both far and near cannot see clear. To correct this
defect, a person is prescribed bifocal lens.
• Astigmatism- Person cannot focus on horizontal and vertical lines at the same
distance at the same time. Cylinderical lens are used.
• Cataract- White membrane is developed on cornea due to which a person loses
power of vision partially or completely. Cured by Surgery.
Light
• Light is a form of energy which helps us to see objects.
• When light falls on objects, it reflects the light and when the reflected
light reaches our eyes then we see the objects.
• Light travels in straight line.
• The common phenomenon of light are formation of shadows formation of
images by mirrors and lenses, bending of light by a medium, twinkling of
stars, formation of rainbow etc.
• Speed of light in vacuum is 3x108 m/s but different in different media.
• Value of speed of light is high in air > water > Glass
• Luminous Objects : Those objects which emit its own light called luminous
objects. E.g. Sun, Stars etc.
• Non-Luminous Objects : Those objects which do not emit its own light but
become visible due to reflection of light falling on them are called non
luminous objects. E.g. Moon, Table.
Reflection of Light
• When light falls on a highly polished surface like a mirror, most of the light
is sent back into the same medium. This process is called reflection of
light.
• (i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and
• (ii) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence and
the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.
• These laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces
including spherical surfaces.
Reflection of Light
Properties of image formed by a plain mirror
• Image formed by a plain mirror is always virtual and erect.
• The size of the image is equal to that of the object.
• The image formed is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it.
• The image is laterally inverted.
• If an object moves towards a plain mirror with speed v, relative to the
object the moves towards it with a speed 2v.
• To see his full image in a plane mirror, a person required a mirror of at
least half of his height.
Properties of image formed by a plain mirror
• When two plane mirrors are kept
facing each other at an angle theta
and an object is placed between
then :
SPHERICAL MIRRORS
• A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is,
faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror. A
spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a
convex mirror.
Concave mirror
• It is a spherical mirror whose reflecting
surface is curved inwards. Rays of light are
parallel to the principal axis after reflection
from a concave mirror, meet at a point
(converge) on the principal axis.
• Also called converging mirror.
• Image formed by a concave mirror is
generally real and inverted.
Convex mirror
• A spherical mirror whose reflecting
surface is curved outwards. Rays of light
parallel to the principal axis after
reflection from a convex mirror get
diverged and appear to come from a
point behind the mirror.
• Also called diverging mirror.
• Image formed by a convex mirror is
always virtual, erect and diminished.
• Mirror’s Formula
• 1/u + 1/v = 1/f
• Where f= focal length of mirror, u= distance of object from mirror, v=
distance of image from mirror
• Magnification (m) = Image distance (v)/ Object distance (u)
Uses of Concave Mirrors
• Concave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and vehicles
headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light.
• They are often used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face.
The dentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of
patients. Large concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to
produce heat in solar furnaces.
 (i) As a shaving mirror
 (ii) As a reflector for the head lights of a vehicle, search light
 (iii) In ophthalmoscope to examine eye, ear, nose by doctors.
 (iv) In solar cookers.
Uses of Convex Mirrors
• Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in vehicles.
• These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the driver to
see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex mirrors are
preferred because they always give an erect, though diminished, image.
• Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved outwards. Thus,
convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger area than would be
possible with a plane mirror.
 (i) As a rear-view mirror in vehicle because it provides the maximum
rear field of view and image formed is always erect.
 (ii) In sodium reflector lamp.
• The height of the object is taken to be positive as the object is
usually placed above the principal axis.
• The height of the image should be taken as positive for virtual
images.
• It is to be taken as negative for real images, a negative sign in the
value of the magnification indicates that the image is real.
• A positive sign in the value of the magnification indicates that the
image is virtual.
Terminology in study of spherical mirrors
• Center of curvature: It is the centre of the
sphere of which the mirror is a part(C).
• Radius of curvature(R): It is the radius of the
sphere of which the mirror is a part.
• Pole: Is the centre of the spherical mirror.
• Principal axis: It is the straight line passing
through the centre of curvature and the pole.
• Focal length: It is the distance between the
pole and principal focus(f). in a spherical
mirror, the radius of curvature is twice the
focal length.
• R=2f or f=R/2
Image Formation by a Concave and Convex
Mirror for Different Positions Of the Object
REFRACTION OF LIGHT
• When light travels obliquely from one
transparent medium into another it
gets bent. This bending of light is called
refraction of light.
• When light travels from a rarer medium
to a denser medium, it bends towards
the normal.
• When light travels from a denser
medium to a rarer medium, it bends
away from the normal.
• The cause of refraction is that the speed
of light is different in different media.
REFRACTION OF LIGHT
• In Refraction, speed of light and its wavelength change but its frequency
remains unchanged, when light travels from one transparent medium to
another.
• Examples :
 when a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters
appear raised when viewed through the glass slab the bottom of a
tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised seen a pencil
partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler. It appears to be displaced
at the interface of air and water
 A lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its
actual size, when viewed from the sides.
Laws of Refraction
• 1. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of
incidence all three lie in the same plane.
• 2. The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction
remains constant for a pair of media i.e. sin i/sin r = constant
• This is called snell’s law and also called refractive index of second medium
with respect of first medium.
• Refractive index = The ratio of speed of light in vacuum ( c ) to the speed
of light in any medium (v)
• A coin appears at lesser depth in water.
ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION
• The air just above the fire becomes hotter than the air further up. The
hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler air above it, and has a
refractive index slightly less than that of the cooler air.
• Since the physical conditions of the refracting medium (air) are not
stationary, the apparent position of the object, as seen through the hot
air, fluctuate.
• This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction of
light by the earth’s atmosphere).
REFRACTIVE INDEX
• The absolute refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed
light in air or vacuum to the speed of light in medium.
• Refractive index = speed of light in air or vacuum/speed of light in
the medium
Twinkling of stars
• The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight.
• The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction
continuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction
occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index.
• Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent
position of the star is slightly different from its actual position.
• As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly,
the starlight entering the eye flickers – the star sometimes appears
brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.
Advance sunrise and delayed sunset
• The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise, and
about 2 minutes after the actual sunset because of atmospheric
refraction.
• The time difference between actual sunset and the apparent sunset is
about 2 minutes.
Examples of Refraction
• Bending of a linear object when it is partially dipped in a liquid inclined to
the surface of the liquid.
• Oval shape of the sun in the morning and evening.
• A fish in a pond when viewed from air appears to be at a smaller depth
them actual depth.
• A coin at the base of a vessel filled with water appears raised.
Dispersion of white light by a glass prism
• The prism has probably split the incident white light into a band of
colours. The sequence of colours VIBGYOR.
• The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion.
• Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the
incident ray, as they pass through a prism.
• The red light bends the least while the violet the most.
• Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus
become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a
spectrum.
• The dispersion of light is due to different velocities of light of different
colours in a medium. As a result, the refractive index of a medium is
different for different colours of light.
• The velocity of light in a medium is maximum for that colour for which
refractive index is minimum. Clearly, the velocity of violet colour or light is
minimum in a medium and refractive index of that medium in a maximum
for violet colour.
• Similarly, the velocity of light in a medium is maximum for red colour and
refractive index of that medium in a minimum for red colour.
Rainbow
• A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower. It
is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the
atmosphere.
• A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun.
• The water droplets act like small prisms. They refract and disperse the
incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when
it comes out of the raindrop.
• Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours
reach the observer’s eye.
Theory of Colours
• Colour is the sensation perceived by the rods in the eye due to light.
• Primary Colours : The spectral colours blue, red and green are called
primary colours because all the colours can be produced by mixing these
in proper proportion.
 Blue + Red + Green = White
• Secondary Colours : The colour produced by mixing any two primary
colours is called secondary colour. There are 3 secondary colours yellow,
magenta and cyan as
• Green + Red = Yellow Red + Blue = Magenta Blue + Green = Cyan
Complementary Colours
• The complementary primary–secondary
combinations are red–cyan, green–magenta,
and blue–yellow. In the RGB color model,
the light of two complementary colors, such
as red and cyan, combined at full intensity,
will make white light, since
two complementary colors contain light
with the full range of the spectrum.
• In coloured television, the three primary
colours are used.
• Red + Cyan = White ; Blue + Yellow = White
etc.
Coloured Television
• Light coming from the scene to be televised is split up in red, blue and
green primary colour components with the help of dichromatic mirrors
fitted in TV camera.
• Now, light of different colours are incident on three separate camera tubes
which converts them into electrical signals.
• These signals are transmitted to distant places. At the receiving end, these
signals are received and the picture tube of a TV set produces the same
scene on the screen.
Mixed coloured Pigments
• The pigments in common use are of impure colours. Therefore, on mixing
paints of different colours the resultant colour of the paint is not obtained
as given by colour triangle.
• When blue and yellow mixed together, they produce green inspite of
white paint.
Colour of Bodies
• The colour of a body is the colour of light which it reflects or transmits. An
object is white, if it reflects all the components of white light and it is
black if it absorbs all the light incident over it.
• This is why red rose appears red when viewed in a white or red light but
appears black when viewed in blue or green light.
SCATTERING OF LIGHT
• When light passes through a medium in which
particles are suspended whose sizes are of the
order of wavelength of light, then light on striking
these particles, deviated in different directions.
This is called scattering of light.
• According to lord Rayleigh, the intensity of
scattered light is fourth power of wavelength.
Therefore, red colour of light is scattered least and
violet colour of light is scattered most.
• The blue colour of the sky, colour of water in deep
sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the
sunset.
Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?
• The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light.
Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in
air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red.
The scattered blue light enters our eyes.
• If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any
scattering.
• Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers
flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights.
• Danger signals are of red colours because red colours light scatters least
and therefore these signals can be seen from far away.
• Sun appears reddish at the time of sunrise or sunset, because the sun is
near horizon and sunlight travels maximum distance in earth’s
atmosphere.
• Clouds appear white because clouds are consists of large size of droplets
of water and dust particles which scatter all colours of light equally. The
mixture of all seven colours of sunlight is white.
• Sky appears black to astronauts from space because there is no
atmosphere in space and therefore, no scattering of light take place.
Critical angle
• Critical angle : The angle of incidence in a denser
medium for which the angle of refraction in rarer
medium becomes 90 degree, is called Critical
Angle (C).
• Refractive index of denser medium =
 1/sin Critical Angle
Total Internal Reflection
• When a light ray travelling from a denser medium towards a rarer medium
is incident at an angle of incidence greater than critical angle, then light
rays reflected back into denser medium. This phenomenon is called TIR.
• For total internal reflection,
• A) Light must be propagating from denser to rarer medium.
• B) Angle of incidence must exceeds the critical angle.
• Examples :
• a) mirage – Desert e.g. Hotter air is less dense, and has smaller refractive
index than the cooler air. On hot summer days, the air near the ground
becomes hotter than the air at higher levels noticed that while moving in a
bus or a car during a hot summer day, a distant patch of road, especially
on a highway, appears to be wet. This is also due to mirage.
• b) Diamonds - Their brilliance is mainly due to the total internal reflection
of light inside them.
• c) Optical fibers too make use of the phenomenon of total internal
reflection. Light undergoes repeated total internal reflections along the
length of the fiber there is no appreciable loss in the intensity of the light
signal.
• Optical Fibers are used in Endoscopy, in decorative table lamps, in
telecommunications and networking.
• Sparkling of diamond, mirage and looming, shinning of air bubble in water
and optical Fiber are examples of total internal reflection.
• Shining of a smoked ball or a metal ball on which lamp soot is deposited
when dipped in a water.
Interference of light
• Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new
wave pattern.
• It refers to the interference of waves which are correlated or coherent
with each other, either because they come from the same source or
because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.
• Two non-monochromatic waves are only fully coherent with each other if
they both have exactly the same range of wavelengths and the same
phase differences at each of the constituent wavelengths.
• The modification in the intensity of light in the region of superposition is
called interference of light.
• Constructive Interference: If the crest of one
wave falls on the crest of another wave, then
the amplitude and resultant intensity is
maximum. This is constructive interference.
Here both the waves have the same
displacement and the waves are in phase.
• Destructive interference: If the crest of one
wave falls on the trough of another wave,
then the amplitude and resultant intensity is
minimum. This is destructive interference.
Here the waves do not have the same
displacement and the waves are out of phase.
Diffraction
• It is the bending of light around the corner of an
obstacle. Reflected light produces fridges of light,
dark or colored bands.
• The spreading of light energy beyond the limit
prescribed by rectilinear propagation of light is
called diffraction of light.
• At times diffraction of sunlight in clouds
produces a multitude of colors.
• Example of diffraction in nature is diamond rays
in the solar eclipse.
Examples
• A soap bubble of oil film on water appears coloured in a white light due to
interference of light reflected from upper and lower surfaces of soap
bubble or oil film.
• In interference patterns of all bright and dark fringes are of same width
but in the diffraction the central fringe is brightest an widest, and
remaining are of gradually decreasing intensities.
• The difference between interference and diffraction is that the
interference is superposition of light coming from two different sources
and in the diffraction it is the superposition between the waves coming
from single wavefront.
Polarisation
• It is the only phenomenon which proves that light is a transverse wave.
• Natural sunlight and most forms of artificial illumination transmit light
waves whose electric field vectors vibrate in all perpendicular planes with
respect to the direction of propagation.
• The visible effect of light is only due to electric field vector.
• Polarisation can take place only in the transverse waves.
• Polarised are used for the polarisation of light.
• Application of Polaroid :
• Used in sun glasses and protect the eye from the glare.
• The wind shield of automobile is made up of polaroid. They protect the
eyes of the driver of automobile from dazzling light of vehicle.
• Used in window panes of train and especially of a aeroplane.
• The picture taken by stereoscopic camera, when seen with the help of
polaroid spectacles, create three dimensional effect.
Tyndall Effect
• Tyndall effect is the scattering of light as a light beam passes through a
colloid. The individual suspension particles scatter and reflect light,
making the beam visible. The amount of scattering depends on the
frequency of the light and density of the particles.
• The earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles
like smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust and molecules
of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine particles, the path of the
beam becomes visible.
• When a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small
hole. Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through a
canopy of a dense forest.
• The color of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering
particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of
larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.
Image Formation by Lenses
• Lens is a transparent medium which is formed by joining two pieces of
spherical glass. There are two types of lenses.
 (i) Convex Lens or Convergent Lens : It is a lens which is thicker at the
centre and thinner at the edges.
 (ii) Concave Lens or Divergent Lens : It is a lens which is thinner at the
centre and thicker at the edges.
Terms Related to a Lens
• Optical Centre of Lens : It is the
centre of the lens through which
light can pass without any deviation
• Principal Axis : It is the line passing
through optical centre and is
perpendicular to the line joining its
edges.
• Principal Focus : It is a point on the
principal axis where all light rays
which are parallel to principal axis
either converge or appear to
diverge from, after refraction.
Image by Convex lens

vision of long-sighted
persons.

 Used in spy holes on
doors to check the
visitors.
 Used to correct the
vision of short-sighted
persons

Real images
• Real Image is an image which can be
projected onto a screen.
• Real images are always located in front
of the mirror and behind the lens.
• Real images are always inverted and
never upright.
• Concave lenses, Convex mirrors and
plane mirrors always form virtual
images and can never form real
images.
Virtual images
• Virtual Image is an image which cannot be projected onto a screen.
• Virtual images are always located in behind the mirror and in front
of the lens.
• Virtual images are always upright and never inverted.
Lens formula for spherical lenses
• The lens formula for spherical lenses is the relationship between
the object distance(u), image distance(v) and focal length (f).
Magnification by lens
• Magnification for spherical lens is the ratio of the height of the
image to the height of the object.
• Magnification = Height of the image/ Height of the object
• The magnification is also related to the object distance and image
distance. It can be expressed as:
Power of Lens
• The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length (in metres).
• The SI unit of power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre is one
dioptre. The power of a convex lens is positive (+ve) and the power
of a concave lens is negative (-ve).
Camera ( f-number)
• The f-number represents the size of aperture,
• f-number = Focal length of the lens/ Diameter of the lens (D)
• Generally 2,2.8,4,5.6 ,8,11,22,32 are f-numbers.
• The amount of Light (L) entering the camera is directly proportional to the
area (A) of the aperture
• i.e. L ∝ A ∝ D2
• Brightness of image ∝ D2/F2
• Exposure time is the time for which light is incident on the photographic
film.
Simple Microscope
• This is simply a convex lens of small focal
length. The object to be enlarged is
placed within the focus of lens.
• Magnifying power = M= 1 + D/f
• Where D= 25cm, f = focal length of lens
• When final image is formed at infinity,
then M = D/f
• Objective lens is a convex lens of large
aperture and large focal length while eye
piece is a convex lens of small aperture
and small focal length.
Compound Microscope
• It consists of two convex lenses coaxially
fitted in a hollow tube. The lens facing the
object is called objective and the lens
towards the eye is called eye piece.
• The aperture of objective is smaller than
that of eye piece.
• Both the lenses are of smaller focal
lengths. This increases the magnifying
power of instrument.
Telescope
• They are used to view distant objects which
are not visible to naked eye.
• Astronomical Telescope consists of two convex
lenses placed coaxially in a hollow tube. The
lens facing the object is called objective lens
and lens towards the eye is called eye piece.
• The objective has large aperture so that the
rays from the object can be easily collected.
• The focal length of objective is larger than that
of eye piece.

Magnetism
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Magnetism
• The earth behaves as a magnet
with the magnetic field pointing
approximately from the
geographic south to the north.
• When a bar magnet is freely
suspended, it points in the northsouth direction. The tip which
points to the geographic north is
called the North Pole and the tip
which points to the geographic
south is called the south pole of
the magnet.
Magnetism
• There is a repulsive force when north
poles (or south poles) of two magnets
are brought close together.
• Conversely, there is an attractive force
between the north pole of one magnet
and the south pole of the other.
• We cannot isolate the north or South
Pole of a magnet.
• If a bar magnet is broken into two
halves, we get two similar bar
magnets with somewhat weaker
properties.
• Unlike electric charges, isolated
magnetic north and south poles
known as magnetic monopoles do
not exist.
• It is possible to make magnets out
of iron and its alloys.
Earth’s Magnetism
• The strength of the earth's magnetic
field varies from place to place on the
earth's surface; its value being of the
order of 10−5 T.
• The magnetic field is now thought to
arise due to electrical currents produced
by convective motion of metallic fluids
(consisting mostly of molten iron and
nickel) in the outer core of the earth.
This is known as the dynamo effect.
• The magnetic field lines of the earth
resemble that of a (hypothetical)
magnetic dipole located at the centre
of the earth.
• The axis of the dipole does not
coincide with the axis of rotation of
the earth but is presently titled by
approximately 11.3 degree with
respect to the later.
• If one looks at the magnetic field lines
of the earth, one sees that unlike in
the case of a bar magnet, the field
lines go into the earth at the north
magnetic pole (Nm) and come out
from the south magnetic pole (Sm).
• The convention arose because the
magnetic north was the direction to which
the north pole of a magnetic needle
pointed; the north pole of a magnet was
so named as it was the north seeking pole.
• Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole
behaves like the south pole of a bar
magnet inside the earth and vice versa.
• The earth's core is very hot and molten,
and the ions of iron and nickel are
responsible for earth's magnetism. This
hypothesis seems very probable.
FACTS
• Moon, which has no molten core, has no magnetic field,
• Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a weaker magnetic field,
while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has
a fairly strong magnetic field.
• However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and the
energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood.
Earth’s Magnetism
• Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and
beyond, in a stream called the solar wind.
• Their motion is affected by the earth's magnetic field, and in turn,
they affect the pattern of the earth's magnetic field.
• The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is quite different from
that in other regions of the earth.
Magnet
• A magnet is a material which can attract iron objects.
• A natural magnet is an ore of iron (𝐹𝑒3𝑂4) called magnetite or lodestone.
• A magnet which is prepared artificially is called an artificial magnet.
• A freely suspended magnet always aligns itself into North-South direction.
Like magnetic poles repel and unlike magnetic poles attract each other.
• A current-carrying coil containing a soft iron core is called an
electromagnet.
• An electromagnet is utilised in electric bell, telegraph, receiver, telephone
diaphragm, transformer, dynamo etc.
• Permanent magnets are made of steel and temporary magnet or
electromagnets are made of soft iron because steel cannot magnetised
easily but when it is magnetised one time, cannot be demagnetised easily.
The soft iron can be magnetised or demagnetised easily.
Properties of Magnet
• Attractive property A magnet can attract
small pieces of magnetic substances like
iron, steel, cobalt, nickel etc. The attraction
is maximum at poles.
• Unlike poles attract and like poles repel.
• Directive property A magnet, when
suspended freely, aligns itself
approximately along geographical N-S line.
• Magnetic poles exist in pairs If a magnet is
cut into two equal parts transverse to its
length, then N and S-poles of the magnet
do not get separated.
Magnetic Field
• The space in the surrounding of a magnet or
a current carrying conductor, in which its
magnetic effect can be experienced, is called
magnetic field.
• Magnetic lines of force is an imaginary line
drawn in magnetic field at which a magnetic
North pole will move, if it is free to do so.
• A tangent drawn at any point of a magnetic
line of force represents the direction of
magnetic field at that point.
• The magnetic flux linked with a
surface is equal to the total
number of magnetic lines of force
passing through that surface
normally.
• Its unit is weber.
Earth’s Magnetism
• The earth has its own magnetic field. The pole near the geographic North
of the earth is called the magnetic North pole.
• Similarly, the pole near the geographic South pole is called the magnetic
South pole.
• Magnetic compass A magnetic needle which always direct in North-South
(N-S) direction.
• The Earth's magnetic field diverts charged particle coming from space
towards its poles and saves living beings from being severely harmed.
Magnetic storm
• Local disturbances in the earth’s magnetic
field which can damage
telecommunication which are probably
caused by lump of charged particles
emanating from the sun are known as
magnetic storm.
• Example: In the Arctic Circle, they are
known as aurora borealis or the northern
lights, while in the Antarctic Circle they
are called aurora australis or the southern
lights.
• Moving Coil Galvanometer
• A moving coil galvanometer is used to detect the
presence of current and the direction of current
in any circuit. It can measure current up to 10-6
ampere.
• Shunt : It is a wire of very small resistance.
Ammeter
• An ammeter is an instrument used to measure
electric current. It is always connected in series.
• The resistance of an ideal ammeter is zero.
• A galvanometer can be converted into an
ammeter by connecting a low resistance/shunt in
parallel.
Voltmeter
• A voltmeter is a device used to measure
potential difference between two points in
an electric circuit.
• The resistance of an ideal voltmeter is
infinity. It is always connected in parallel.
• A galvanometer can be converted into a
voltmeter by connecting a high resistance
in series.
• A small resistance connected in parallel
with the load resistance to reduce amount
of electric current through resistor is called
shunt.
Magnetic Substances
There are three types of magnetic substances
• Paramagnetic
• Diamagnetic
• Ferromagnetic.
Paramagnetic Substances
• Those substances which are feebly magnetised in the direction of
magnetic field when placed in strong magnetic field are called
paramagnetic substances.
• For examples—Aluminium, platinum, chromium, manganese, solutions of
salts of iron, nickel, oxygen etc.
• These substances are attracted towards strong magnetic field in a nonuniform magnetic field.
• The magnetism of these substances decreases with increase in
temperature.
Diamagnetic Substances
• Those substances which are feebly magnetised in the opposite direction of
magnetic field when placed in strong magnetic field are called
diamagnetic substances.
• For examples— Gold, silver, zinc, copper, mercury, water, alcohol, air,
hydrogen etc.
• These substances are attracted towards weak magnetic field in a nonuniform magnetic field.
• The magnetism produced in these substances does not change with
increase or decrease in temperature.
Ferromagnetic Substances
• Those substances which are strongly magnetised in the direction of
magnetic field when placed in it, are called ferromagnetic substances.
• For examples —Iron, nickel, cobalt etc.
Curie Temperature
• The magnetism produced in these substances decreases with increase in
temperature and at a particular temperature, called Curie temperature.
• At the Curie temperature, a paramagnetic substance becomes
diamagnetic.
• Curie temperature for iron is 770°C and for nickel is 358°C.
• Permanent magnets are made up of steel, cobalt, steel, ticonal, alcomax
and alnico.
Facts
• Isogonic lines are lines on the
Earth's surface along which the
declination has the same
constant value, and
• lines along which the declination
is zero are called agonic lines.
• Isoclinic lines are imaginary lines on
the earth's surface connecting points
where the earth's magnetic field has
the same angle.
• The aclinic line is the magnetic
equator, where the magnetic field is
inclined neither north or south, so it's
a special case of an isoclinic line.
• Isodynamic line- A line on a map
connecting points of equal strength of
the earth's magnetic field.
Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)
• Whenever the magnetic flux linked with
an electric circuit changes, an emf is
induced in the circuit. This phenomenon
is called electromagnetic induction.
Faraday’s Laws of EMI
• Whenever the magnetic flux linked with
a circuit changes, an induced emf is
produced in it.
• The induced emf loses as long as the
change in magnetic flux continues.
Lenz’s Law
• The direction of induced emf
or induced current is always
in such a way that it opposes
the cause due to which it is
produced.
Eddy Current
• If a piece of metal is placed in a varying
magnetic field or rotated with high speed
in a uniform magnetic field, then induced
current set up in the piece is like whirlpool
of air, called eddy current, also known as
foucault’s current.
Uses
• Eddy currents are used in dead beat
galvanometer, induction furnaces,
induction motor, speedometers of
automobiles etc.
• Eddy currents are used in diathermy for
deep heat treatment of the human body.
Self and Mutual Induction
• The phenomenon of production of
induced emf in a circuit due to change in
current flowing in its own, is called self
induction.
• The unit of self induction is Henry (H).
• The phenomenon of production of
induced emf in a circuit due to change in
magnetic flux in its neighbouring circuit, is
called mutual induction.
• Its unit is Henry (H).
Alternating Current
• An electric current whose magnitude and direction
changes continuously is called alternating current.
• The frequency of alternating current in India is 50 Hz
i.e. a 50Hz electrical system means that it completes
50 cycles per second
• Mean or average value of AC is zero for one
complete cycle. Since the positive and negative
half cycles are equal, therefore the charge
transferred due to these two halves will be equal but
in opposite direction.
• Therefore, net charge transferred across any point of
circuit in one time period of sinusoidal AC current
is zero. Hence, its average value is zero.
 Root mean square value of AC is given by
𝐼𝑟𝑚𝑠 = 𝐼0/√2
 An AC ammeter and AC voltmeter read root mean square value of
alternating current and alternating voltage respectively.
• AC Generator or Dynamo
 It is a device which Inverts mechanical energy into alternating current.
 Its working is based on electromagnetic induction.
• DC Motor
 It is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
 Its working is based on the fact that when a current carrying coil is
placed in uniform magnetic field, a torque acts on it.
Microphone
 It converts sound into electrical energy and works on the principle of
EMI.
Transformer
• It is a device which can change a low voltage current into a high voltage
current and vice-versa. Its working is based on mutual induction and can
be used in case of alternating current.
• Step-up Transformer
 It converts a low voltage current into a high voltage current.
 The main energy losses in a transformer are given below
 Iron loss —Flux loss
• Step–down Transformer
 It converts a high voltage current into a low voltage current.
• The current generated in the power stations are alternating current
having voltage 22000 volt or more.
• In grid substations, with the help of transformer, their voltage is
increased up to 132000 volt to minimise loss of energy in long
distance transmission.
Electricity
• Flow of Electrons is called Electricity
• The electricity produced by friction between
two appropriate bodies, is called static
electricity, it is also called frictional electricity.
• Coulomb’s law:-
 The electrostatic force of interaction acting
between two stationary point charges is
directly proportional to the product of
magnitude of charges and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
F=(Kq1-q2)/r2
Electric Field
• The space in the surrounding of any
charge in which its influence can be
experience by other charge, is called
electric field.
• Electric field intensity (E) at any point is
defined as the electrostatic force (F) acting
per unit positive test charge (q) at the
point.
• 𝑬 = 𝑭/ 𝑞
• Its unit is newton/coulomb.
• Therefore, electric field intensity is
inversely proportional to the square of the
distance r from the point charge.
Electric Field
• Electric Field Lines
 An electric field line is an
imaginary line, so that its tangent
at any point is in the direction of
the electric field vector at that
point.
 Two lines can never intersect.
Electric field lines always begin
on a positive charge and end on a
negative charge and do not start
or stop in mid space.
Electric Potential
• Electric potential at a point in an
electric field is equal to the work done
per unit charge in carrying a test charge
from infinity to that point. Its unit is
joule/coulomb.
• Electric potential, V = 𝑊/𝑞
• Potential difference is that physical
quantity which decides the direction of
flow of charge between two points in
electric field.
• Positive charge always tends to move
from higher potential towards lower
potential.
Electric Dipole and Capacitor
• An electric dipole consists of two
equal and opposite point charges
separated by a very small distance.
• Electric dipole moment of the dipole
is product of charge and the
separation between the charges.
• A capacitor or condenser is a device
over which a large amount of charge
can be stored without changing its
dimensions.
• The capacitance of a conductor is equal to the ratio of the charge
(q) given to the conductor to change in its potential (V) is given by C
=𝑞/𝑉
• Its unit is coulomb/volt or farad. Farad (F) is a large unit of
capacitance. Its practical unit is microfarad (𝜇𝐹).
1𝜇𝐹 = 10−6𝐹
Important Facts
• A comb run through one's dry hair attracts small bits of paper. Why?
What happens if the hair is wet or if it is a rainy day?
• (Remember, a paper does not conduct electricity). This is because the
comb gets charged by friction.
• The molecules in the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting
in a net force of attraction.
• If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction between hair and the comb
reduces. The comb does not get charged and thus it will not attract small
bits of paper.
Important Facts
• Ordinary rubber is an insulator. But special rubber tyres of aircraft are
made slightly conducting. Why is this necessary?
• To enable them to conduct charge (produced by friction) to the ground; as
too much of static electricity accumulated may result in spark and result in
fire.
Important Facts
• A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happens to the bird.
A man standing on the ground touches the same line and gets a fatal
shock. Why?
• When a bird is perched on a bare high power line , the circuit does
not get completed between the earth and the bird , therefore nothing
happens to the bird .
• When a man standing on ground touches the same line, the circuit
between the man and the earth gets completed. As a result, he gets a fatal
shock.
• Current passes only when there is difference in potential.
• Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow. Currents
do not obey the law of vector addition. That current is a scalar also follows
from it's definition.
• Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a
negative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form closed
loops.

Mahajanpadas
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Mahajanapadas & Rise of Magadha
• In the 8th century BC, India could be broadly
understood in terms of five large regions viz.
• Madhyadesa (the middle country),
• Pratichya (western lands),
• Prachya (Eastern region),
• Uttarpatha (the land in the north of Vindhyas)
• and Dakshinpatha (the land south of Vindhyas).
• Panini in the 4
th century BC mentions as many as 22
different Janpadas, but also mentions 3 most
important viz. Magadha, Kosala and Vatsa.
Mahajanapadas
• Budhhist literature Angutara Nikaya,
Mahavastu and Jain literature
(Bhagvati Sutta) gives a list of 16 great
kingdoms or Mahajanapadas in the
begining of 6
thcentury B.C
• Major reason of the formation of
Janapadas was use of Iron tools for
agricultural & military purposes
Evolution of Mahajanapadas
• The society in Vedic period was rural, where
smallest political unit was a Vis.
• However, some later Vedic texts detail about the
Janpadas such as Kuru, Panchala, Matysa, Kunti,
Kikata, Jayminia, Kashi, Magadha, Anga,
Kamboja etc.
• The rise of Janpadas is mainly attributed to the
establishment of settled agriculture
communities.
• The development of an agriculture based
economy led to increase in crops and cattle
wealth coupled with use of iron in technology.
Evolution of Mahajanapadas
• The society was now totally divided into 4
Varna Based upon occupation, new labour
class and landed classes emerged. The
landed class was known as Gahapatis.
• The trade flourished and the towns, which
were either located on trade routes such
as Mathura or located, near the banks of
rivers such as Magadha developed.
• This transition also saw an emergence of
taxing, standing army, territorial powers
etc.
Anga
• Capital: Champa
• Modern location: Munger and
Bhagalpur

taken over by Magadha Empire.
• It is situated in present day Bihar
and West Bengal.
Magadha
• Capital: Girivraja/ Rajagriha
• Modern location: Gaya and Patna
• Magadha finds mention in the Atharva
Veda which conveys that Magadha
was semi-Brahmanical habitation.
• It was located in present day Bihar
close to Anga, divided by river
Champa.
• Later, Magadha became a center of
Jainism and the first Buddhist Council
was held in Rajagriha.
Kasi

Rise of Magadha
• Magadhan Empire:
 The Magadha Empire ruled in
India from 684 BC- 320 BC.
 It is also mentioned in the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana.
 It was the most powerful amongst
the sixteen mahajanapadas.
 The empire was established by
king Brihadratha.
Magadhan Empire
• Rajgaha (or Rajgir) was the capital
of Magadha but was later shifted
to Pataliputra in the fourth century
BCE.
• Iron was used to manufacture tools
and weapons.
• The elephants found in its forests
were used in the army.
• The riverine route of Ganga and its
tributaries made communication
cheap and convenient.
Magadhan Empire
• The implementation of policies by the
efficient bureaucracy of ruthless and
ambitious kings like Bimbisara, Ajatasattu
and Mahapadma Nanda made Magadha
prosperous.
• The first king of Magadha was Bimbisara
and he belonged to the Haryanka dynasty.
• Avanti was Magadha’s main rival but later
entered into an alliance.
• Marriages helped in building political
alliances and king Bimbisara married a lot
of princesses from nearby kingdoms.
The Haryanka Dynasty
• It was the second dynasty to rule over Magadha after
the Brihadratha dynasty.
• The dynasty was founded by king Bhattiya, the father
of Bimbisara.
• The dynasty ruled over Magadha from 6th century
BCE to 413 BCE.
• It was succeeded by the Shishunga dynasty.
The Haryanka Dynasty
• The kings of Haryanka dynasty are:
 Bhattiya
 Bimbisara
 Ajatasattu
 Udayabhadra
 Anuruddha
 Munda
 Nagadasaka
Bimbisara (546 – 494 BC)
• Contemporary of both Buddhism & jainism
• Set up his capital at Rajgir (Known as
Girivraja)
• Strengthened his position by marriage
alliances (Kosala, lichhavi (Vaishali) & madra
clan (Punjab))
• Acquired Anga under the viceroyality of
Ajatashatru.
• Fought with Pradyota of Avanti but later
became friends and sent a physician Jivaka
to Ujjain when he was attacked by Jaundice.
Bimbisara (546 – 494 BC)
• His religion is not very clear. While Buddhist
texts mention him as a disciple of Buddha, Jain
scriptures describe him as the follower of
Mahavir and refer to him as King Shrenika of
Rajgir.
• Known as Seniya. He was the ist king who had a
regular and standing army.
• Bimbisara was later imprisoned by his son
Ajatasattu who annexed the throne of
Magadha. Bimbisara later died during
imprisonment.
Ajatashatru
• Killed his father & succeeded to the throne
• Fought with Kosala & Vaishali (Lichhavis –
destroyed it in 16 years) & won both war
and expanded the kingdom of Magadha
• He fortified the capital city Rajgir.
• As it was surrounded by five hills, it
became almost impregnable.
• Embraced buddhism & led the foundation
for 1
st Budhhist council at Rajgir
Udayin
• Succesor of Ajatashatru + Founded new capital at Pataliputra (on the
confluence of the Son and the Ganges and shifted the capital from
Rajgriha to Pataliputra)
• His death marked the end of Haryanka dynasty
• Udayin was succeeded by the Shishunagas.
Shishunagas
• Temporary shifted the capital to Vaishali
• Defeated Avanti and it was the most important achievement of him &
bought end to 100 year old rivalry.
• Transferred capital from Vaishali to Patliputra.
• Shishunaga was succedded by Kalasoka (Kalavarna).
• He led the foundation of 2
nd Buddhist council.
• They were later succeeded by the Nanda dynasty
The Nanda Dynasty
• The dynasty lasted from 345 BCE321 BCE.
• Mahapadma Nanda, the first king
of the Nanda dynasty, added
Kalinga to the Magadhan Empire.
• He was considered to be so
powerful and ruthless that even
Alexander did not wish to fight
against him.
The Nanda Dynasty
• The Nanda dynasty became
immensely wealthy.
• They started irrigation projects and
standardized trade measures
across their kingdom.
• Harsh and inflexible taxation
system, however, made the
Nandas unpopular.
• The last Nanda king, Dhana Nanda,
was overthrown by Chandragupta
Maurya.
Mahapadmananda
• Known as Sarvakshatrantak i.e. uprooter of all
the Kshatriyas (Puranas) and Ugrasena i.e.
owner of huge army (Pali texts).
• Known as Ekarat (sole king who destroy
others).
• He is often described as ‘the first empire
builder of Indian History’.
• Conquered Kalinga & bought image of Jina as
trophy
• Hathigumpha inscription of kharavela King
(Kalinga) refers to conquest of Kalinga by
Nandas.
Dhanananda
• Last ruler of Nanda dynasty
• During his reign, Alexander
invaded India but did not
move ahead to east (Nanda’s
Power)
• Chandragupta Maurya &
Kautilya overthrew him as
oppressive way of tax
collection was already
resented by people
Cause of Magadha’s Success
• Among them Magadha, Vatsa, Avanti and
Kosala were the most prominent ones.
Out of these four, Magadha emerged as
the most powerful kingdom.
• The causes of Magadha’s success were as
following:
• Magadha was located on the upper and
lower parts of the Gangetic valley.
• It was located on the main land route
between west and east India.
• The area had fertile soil. It also received
enough rainfall.
• Magadha was encircled by rivers on three
sides, the Ganga, Son and Champa making
the region impregnable to enemies.
• Capitals: Rajgir (Surrounded by 5 hills),
• Patliputra (Surrounded by Ganga,
Gandhak, Son & Ghagra rivers
• Both Rajgir and Pataliputra were located in
strategic positions.
Economic factors
• Magadha had huge copper and iron deposits.
• Because of its location, it could easily control trade.
• Had a large population which could be used for agriculture, mining, building
cities and in the army.
• General prosperity of the people and the rulers.
• The mastery over Ganga meant economic hegemony. Ganga was important for
trade in North India.
• With the annexation of Anga by Bimbisara, river Champa was added to the
Magadha Empire. Champa was important in the trade with South-East Asia, Sri
Lanka and South India.
Cultural factors
• Magadhan society had an unorthodox character.
• It had a good mix of Aryan and non-Aryan peoples.
• Emergence of Jainism and Buddhism led to a revolution in terms of
philosophy and thought. They enhanced liberal traditions.
• Society was not so much dominated by the Brahmanas and many kings of
Magadha were ‘low’ in origins.
Political factors
• Magadha was lucky to have many powerful and ambitious rulers.
• They had strong standing armies.
• Availability of iron enabled them to develop advanced weaponry.
• They were also the first kings to use elephants in the army.
• The major kings also developed a good administrative system.

Making of the
Constitution
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

• It was in 1934 that the idea of a Constituent Assembly for India was put
forward for the first time by M. N. Roy, a pioneer of communist
movement in India and an advocate of radical democratism.
• In 1935, the Indian National Congress (INC), for the first time, officially
demanded a Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution of India.
• In 1938, Jawaharlal Nehru, on behalf the INC declared that ‘the
Constitution of free India must be framed, without outside interference,
by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise’.
• The demand was finally accepted in principle by the British Government
in what is known as the ‘August Offer’ of 1940.
Demand for a Constituent Assembly
• In 1942, Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the cabinet, came to India with a
draft proposal of the British Government on the framing of an
independent Constitution to be adopted after the World War II. The
Cripps Proposals were rejected by the Muslim League which wanted India
to be divided into two autonomous states with two separate Constituent
Assemblies.
• Finally, a Cabinet Mission was sent to India
 The Cabinet Mission consisting of three members (Lord Pethick Lawrence,
Sir Stafford Cripps and A V Alexander) arrived in India on March 24, 1946
and published its plan on May 16, 1946.
While it rejected the idea of two Constituent Assemblies, it put forth a
scheme for the Constituent Assembly which more or less satisfied the
Muslim League.
On December 13, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru moved the historic ‘Objectives
Resolution’ in the Assembly. It laid down the fundamentals and
philosophy of the constitutional structure.
Later it’s name changed to Preamble in the Constitution. ( Idea borrowed
from USA )
Objectives Resolution
• The Constituent Assembly was constituted in November 1946 under
the scheme formulated by the Cabinet Mission Plan. The features of
the scheme were:

Drafting Committee
• The motion on Draft Constitution was declared as passed on
November 26, 1949, and received the signatures of the members and
the president. This is also the date mentioned in the Preamble as the
date on which the people of India in the Constituent Assembly
adopted, enacted and gave to themselves this Constitution.
• The Constitution as adopted on November 26, 1949, contained a
Preamble, 395 Articles and 8 Schedules.
Enactment of the Constitution
• The major provisions of the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950.
This day is referred to in the Constitution as the ‘date of its commencement’,
and celebrated as the Republic Day.
• January 26 was specifically chosen as the ‘date of commencement’ of the
Constitution because of its historical importance. It was on this day in 1930
that Purna Swaraj day was celebrated, following the resolution of the Lahore
Session (December 1929) of the INC.
Enforcement of the Constitution
In addition to the making of the Constitution and enacting of ordinary laws,
the Constituent Assembly also performed the following functions:
1. It ratified the India’s membership of the Commonwealth in May 1949.
2. It adopted the national flag on July 22, 1947.
3. It adopted the national anthem on January 24, 1950.
4. It adopted the national song on January 24, 1950.
5. It elected Dr Rajendra Prasad as the first President of India on January
24, 1950.
Other Functions Performed by the
Constituent Assembly
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the then Law Minister, piloted the Draft Constitution in the
Assembly. He took a very prominent part in the deliberations of the Assembly. He
was known for his logical, forceful and persuasive arguments on the floor of the
Assembly. He is recognized as the ‘Father of the Constitution of India’.

Marine Coastline
Landforms
By Dr Vipan
Goyal

Marine Coastline Landforms
• The most powerful agents of marine erosion are waves. Their origin is due to the
sweeping of winds over the water surface.
• Sea waves, aided by winds, currents, tides and storms carry on the erosional and
depositional processes.
• The erosive work of the sea depends upon size and strength of waves, slope, height of
the shore between low and high tides, shape of the coast, composition of rocks, depth of
water, human activity etc.
• The wave pressure compresses the air trapped inside rock fissures, joints, faults, etc.
forcing it to expand and rupture the rocks along weak points.
• This is how rocks undergo weathering under wave action.
Marine Coastline Landforms
• Waves also use rock debris as instruments of erosion (glaciers are quite good at
this).
• These rock fragments carried by waves themselves get worn down by striking
against the coast or against one another.
• The solvent or chemical action of waves is another mode of erosion, but it is
pronounced only in case of soluble rocks like limestone and chalk.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Capes and Bays:
• On exposed coasts, the continual action of
waves on rocks of varying resistance causes
the coastline to be eroded irregularly.
• E.g. The softer rocks are worn back into
inlets, cover or bays and the harder ones
persist as headlands or capes.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Wave-Cut Platform
 When the sea waves strike against a cliff,
the cliff gets eroded (lateral erosion)
gradually.
 The waves level out the shore region to
carve out a horizontal plane or a wave-cut
platform.
 The bottom of the cliff suffers the
maximum intensive erosion by waves and,
as a result, a notch appears at this position.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Sea Cliff
• The most widespread landforms of erosional
coasts are sea cliffs.
• Generally, any very steep rock face adjoining the
coast forms a cliff from a few m to 30 m or even
more.
• Their steep nature is the result of wave-induced
erosion near sea level and the subsequent
collapse of rocks at a higher elevation.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Sea Caves
• Prolonged attack of waves against the
base of the cliff and the rock debris that
gets smashed against the cliff along with
lashing waves create holes in regions of
weakness and get further widened and
deepened to form sea caves.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Sea Arches
• When two caves approach one another
from either side of a headland and unite,
they form a bridge like structure, known as
arch
• These archways may have an arcuate or
rectangular shape, with the opening
extending below water level and can be up
to tens of metres above sea level.
• It formed when the waves attack a rockform from two opposite sides, the
differential erosion
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Stacks/Skarries/Chimney Rock
 When a portion of the sea arch
collapses, the remaining column-like
structure is called a stack, skarry or
chimney rock.
 The seaward portion of headland will
remain as an isolated pillar of rock
known as stack
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Stump
• The stack is gradually eroded,
leaving behind only the stump
• Stumps are only just visible
above the sea level
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Blow Holes or Spouting Horns
 The burst of water through a small hole on a sea cave
due to the compression of air in the cave by strong
waves. They make a peculiar noise.
• Geos
• The enlargement of blow-holes and
the continued action of waves weaken
the cave roof.
• When the roof collapses a long,
narrow inlet or creek develops.
• Such long and deep clefts are called
Geos

Marine Depositional Landforms
• Beach
• This is the temporary covering of rock debris on or
along a wave-cut platform.
• Beaches are characteristic of shorelines that are
dominated by deposition but may occur as patches
along even the rugged shores.
• Sands and gravels loosened from the land are
moved by waves to be deposited along the shore as
beaches
• Beaches called shingle beaches contain excessively
small pebbles and even cobbles.
Marine Depositional Landforms
• Bar
• Currents and tidal currents deposit rock
debris and sand along the coast at a
distance from the shoreline.
• The resultant landforms which remain
submerged are called bars.
• The off-shore bars and barriers commonly
form across the mouth of a river or at the
entrance of a bay.
• Bars are submerged features and when bars
show up above water, they are called
barrier bars.
• Generally, bars are approximately parallel to
the coast

• It is the overwater counterpart of a bar
• An off-shore bar which is exposed due
to further addition of sand is termed a
barrier bar and are commonly form
across the mouth of a river or at the
entrance of a bay.
• They usually occur in chains
• They are subject to change during
storms and other action, but absorb
energy and protect the coastlines
Marine Depositional Landforms
• Spit and Hook
 A spit is a projected deposition joined at
one end to the headland, with the other
end free in the sea.
 The mode of formation is similar to a bar
or barrier.
 A shorter spit with one end curved
towards the land is called a Hook
Marine Depositional Landforms
• Tombolos
• Sometimes, islands are
connected to each other by a bar
called tombolo.
• The tombolo is a deposition
landform in which an island is
attached to the mainland by a
narrow piece of lands such as a
spit or bar.
• A tombolo is a sandy isthmus.
Coastlines
• The boundary between the coast (the part of the land adjoining or near
the sea) and the shore (the land along the edge of a sea) is known as the
coastline.
• Coastline are modified either due to rise or fall in sea levels or upliftment
or subsidence of land, or both.
Coastlines
• Coastline of Emergence
• Coastline of Submergence
• Neutral coastline
Coastlines can be divided into the following classes:
Coastlines of Emergence
• Faulting and earth movement may
thrust up coastal plateau so that the
whole region is raised, with consequent
emergent features.
• Bars, spits, lagoons, salt marshes,
beaches, sea cliffs and arches are the
typical features.
• The east coast of India, especially its
south-eastern part (Tamil Nadu coast)
and Malabar coast (Kerala) appears to
be a coast of emergence.
Coastlines of Submergence
• A submerged coast is produced
either by subsidence of land or by
a rise in sea level.
• Konkan coast/ Maharashtra and
Goa Coast are the examples of
Coastline of submergence
• Ria, fjord, Dalmatian and drowned
lowlands are its typical features.
Ria Coast
• When a region is dissected by
streams into a system of valleys and
divides, submergence produces a
highly irregular shoreline called ria
coastline.
• A Ria coast is typical of the Atlantic
type of coast like those of north-west
France, north-west Spain, south-west
Ireland.
Fjord Coast
• These coasts have long and narrow inlets
with very steep sides.
• They mark the paths of glaciers that
plunged down from the highlands.
• Due to the greater intensity of ice erosion
fiords are deep for distances.
• E.g. Norway, Alaska, British Columbia,
southern Chile and the South Island of New
Zealand.
Dalmatian
• The Dalmatian coasts result by
submergence of mountain ridges
with alternating crests and troughs
which run parallel to the sea coast.
• This is the longitudinal coast where
mountains run parallel or
concordant to the coast.
• The Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia
is a typical example.
Drowned lowland
• A drowned lowland is formed by the
submergence of a low-lying area.
• It is characterized by a series of bars
running parallel to the coast, enclosing
lagoons.
• The Baltic coast of eastern Germany is an
example of this type of coastline.
Neutral Coastlines
• These are coastlines formed as a
result of new materials being built
out into the water.
• The word ‘neutral’ implies that
there need be no relative change
between the level of sea and the
coastal region of the continent.

Matter
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Matter
• Matter is considered as any thing which has weight and occupies
space.
• It exists in three states: Solid, liquid and gas.
• In solid, molecules vibrate about fixed positions.
• In liquid, molecules also vibrate but simultaneously they move
freely throughout the material.
• In gas, the molecules are much farther apart than in solids and
liquids and move at high velocities.
Inter-atomic Forces
• The electrostatic force of interaction acting between the two or
more atoms is called inter-atomic forces.
• The range of inter-atomic forces is equal to the order of atomic size,
i.e. 10−10 m.
• A force which changes the configuration of a body is called a
deforming force.
Solid
• It is that, state of matter which has definite shape and definite
volume. In this state molecules are very closely packed.
• Properties of Solids
 Elasticity
o The property of a body by virtue of which it regain its
original configuration after the removal of deforming force,
is called elasticity.
o Quartz/silicon dioxide (SiO2
) and phosphor bronze are almost
perfectly elastic bodies.
Properties of Solids
• Plasticity
 The property of a body by virtue of which it doesn’t regain its original
configuration after the removal of deforming force, is called plasticity.
• Strain
 The fractionaI change in configuration i.e. length, volume and shape, is called
strain. Strain has no unit.
 On the basis of change in configuration, strain is of three types
 Longitudinal strain = Δ𝐼/ 𝐼
 Volume strain = Δ𝑉/𝑉
 Shearing strain = θ (ratio of relative displacement of any layer to its
perpendicular distance from fixed layer.)
• Stress
 The internal restoring force acting per unit area of crosssection of a deformed body is called stress. Its unit is
kg⋅m−1
⋅s
−2 and Dimension: M L
−1 T
−2
 Stress is of two types
 Normal stress : occurs when a member is loaded by an
axial force.
 Tangential stress : When the direction of the deforming
force or external force is parallel to the cross-sectional
area. This results in the change in the shape of the body.
 The maximum deforming force up-to which a body retains
its property of elasticity is called the limit of elasticity of
the material body.
 The minimum stress required to break a wire is called
breaking stress.
 Torque : A force that tends to cause rotation. it has units of Newtonmeters. Torque can be written as T = F * r * sin(theta),
 The torque required to produce a given twist in a hollow cylinder is
greater than that required to produce the same twist in a solid cylinder.
Therefore, hollow shaft is stronger than a solid shaft.
 Young's modulus of elasticity: Y=
longitudinal stress/ longitudinal strain
 Young's modulus describes
tensile elasticity, or the tendency of an
object to deform along an axis when
opposing forces are applied along that
axis; it is defined as the ratio of tensile
stress to tensile strain. It is often
referred to simply as the elastic
modulus. Its units are (N/m2
).
 Springs are made of steel, not of
copper as Young's modulus of elasticity
of steel is more than that of copper.
 Hook's law : states that the force needed to
compress or extend a spring is directly
proportional to the distance you stretch it.
 Represented as F = kx, where F is the force we
apply, k is the spring constant, and x is the
extension of the material (typically in meters).
 Its Sl unit is Nm-2 also called pascal.
 Under elastic limit, stress is proportional to
strain.
 stress x strain
 Stress = strain E (constant) E is called elastic
constant or modulus of elasticity. Its value is
different for different material.
 Bulk modulus of elasticity : It is
a modulus associated with a volume
strain, when a volume is compressed.
 Bulk modulus = ( pressure applied /
fractional change in volume).
 It is denoted with a symbol of K. It has
the dimension of force per unit area.
 The bulk modulus concept is mostly
applied in liquids.
 Bulk modulus is the measure of the
decrease in volume with an increase
in pressure.
• Rigidity modulus/ shear modulus : It is defined
as “the ratio of shear stress to the
displacement per unit sample length
(shear strain).
• It is defined as a material property with a value
equal to the shear stress divided by
the shear strain.
• Shear stress arises from the force vector
component parallel to the cross section of the
material.
• Shear strain is the ratio of the change
in deformation to its original length
perpendicular to the axes of the member due
to shear stress.
Properties of Solids
• Elastic Limit
 It is the limit of stress and strain upto which a wire remains elastic.
• Plastic Behaviour
 If the wire is stretched beyond the elastic limit, the strain increases
much more rapidly. If the stretching force is removed, the wire does
not come back to its natural length.
• Fracture Point
 If the deformation is increased further the plastic behaviour, the wire
breaks at a point known as fracture point.
Properties of Solids
• Ductile and Brittle Materials
 If large deformation takes place between the elastic limit and the fracture
point, the material is called ductile. (drawn out into a thin wire).
 If the wire breaks soon after the elastic limit is crossed, it is called brittle.
• Elastic Fatigue
 It is the property of an elastic body by virtue of which its behaviour
becomes less elastic under the action of repeated alternating deforming
force.
 Due to elastic fatigue, the bridges become less elastic after a use of long
time and therefore are declared unsafe.
Fluid
• A substance which begins to flow under an external force is called a fluid.
Liquids and gases are fluids.
• Fluid Density
 The ratio of mass to the volume of a body is called its density. (i.e.
mass present in its unit volume). It is a scalar quantity having SI unit
kg/𝑚3.
 The density of water is 1000 kg/𝑚3.
 The density of water is maximum at 4°C.
• Hydrometer It is an instrument used to measure density or relative
density of liquid. Its working is based on law of floatation.
Pressure
• Pressure is defined as the force applied per unit surface area. It is a scalar
quantity.
 Pressure= Force applied/Area of Surface
 The SI unit of Pressure is N/m2 which is called Pascal.
• Fluid Pressure
 Thrust (the normal force) exerted by a liquid per unit area of the
surface in contact at rest, is called fluid pressure.
 Fluid pressure (p) = 𝐹/ 𝐴
 Its unit is 𝑁𝑚−2 or Pascal (Pa).
Pressure
• Atmospheric Pressure
 The pressure exerted by the atmosphere, is called atmospheric pressure.
 Aneroid barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure and height of
a place.
 Units of atmospheric pressure are torr and bar.
 It is the pressure which is exerted by mercury column of 76 cm length at 00
C at 450 latitude at sea level. It is measured in bar.
 1 bar 105 N/m2 Atmospheric pressure 1 atm 1.01 bar 760 torr.
Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.
 That is why it is difficult to cook on the mountain and fountain pen of a
passenger leaks in aeroplane at height.
• Sudden fall in barometric reading is the indication of storm.
• Slow fall in barometric reading is indication of rain.
• Slow rise in barometric reading is indication of clear weather.
• Pressure in Fluids: Force exerted on unit area of wall or base of the
container by the molecules of liquid is the pressure of liquid.
• Pressure exerted by a liquid at depth h below the surface of liquid is P =hdg
where d is density of liquid.
• In a static liquid at same horizontal level, pressure is same at all points.
• Pascal’s Law
 The pressure exerted anywhere
at a point of confined fluid is
transmitted equally and
undiminished, in all directions
throughout the liquid.
 Hydraulic lift, hydraulic press,
hydraulic brakes works on the
basis of Pascal’s law.

Buoyancy
• When a body is partially or wholly
immersed in a liquid, an upward force
acts on it, which is called buoyant force or
upthrust and this property of fluids is
called buoyancy.
• Buoyant force is equal to the weight of
the liquid displaced by the submerged
part of the body.
• The buoyant force acts at the centre of
gravity of the liquid displaced by the
submerged part of the body, which is
called ‘centre of buoyancy’.
• Relative density is measured by Hydrometer.
• The density of sea water is more than that of normal water. This explains
why it is easier to swim in sea water.
• When ice floats in water, its 1/10 part remains outside the water. If ice
floating in water in a vessel melts, the level of water in the vessel does not
change.
• Purity of milk is measured by lactometer.
Archimedes Principle
• When a body is partially or
completely immersed in a
liquid, it loses some of its
weight.
• The loss in weight is equal to
the weight of the liquid
displaced by the submerged
part of the body.
Law of Floatation
• A body will float in a liquid if weight of the
body is equal weight of the liquid
displaced by the immersed part of the
body.
• In floating condition, the centre of gravity
(g) and the centre of buoyancy (B) of the
floating body must lie on the same straight
line.
• Ice and large icebergs float on water
surface as its density (0.92 g/cm3) is lesser
than the density of water.
• When a piece of ice floats on water, its
(11/ 12) 𝑡ℎ part submerged in water and
(1/12) th part is outside the water.
• In sea water, (8/ 9) th part of icebergs is submerged and (1/9) th part is
outside the water during floating.
• It is easier to swim in sea water than in a river as density of sea water is
greater than the density of river water. In sea water, buoyant force is
greater than that in river water.
• The density of human body is less than the density of water but the
density of human head is greater than the density of water. Therefore,
during swimming a person displaces the liquid with hands and legs and
total weight of displaced liquid becomes equal to the weight of the body.
• A ballon filled with a light gas, such as hydrogen rises because the average
density of the ballon and the gas is less than that of the air.
• A submarine has large ballast tank. When these tanks are filled with water,
the average density of the submarine becomes more than that of water
can dive easily.
• When the submarine is ready to come at surface, compressed air is forced
into the ballast tanks forcing the water out, thus reducing the density of
submarine which can then rise.
Surface Tension
• The property of a liquid by virtue of which it tries to minimise its free
surface area is called surface tension.
• The minimum surface area of a given amount of liquid is for spherical
shape. Therefore, rain drops are spherical.
• Surface tension of a liquid becomes zero at critical temperature. (Critical
temperature is the highest temperature at which a gas can be turned into
liquid using pressure.)
• Surface Tension = Force/Length
Surface Tension
• Factors Affecting Surface Tension
 Temperature : The surface tension of a liquid decreases with
increase in temperature because cohesive forces decrease
with an increase of molecular thermal activity.
 Soluble Impurities : If the impurities are less soluble in liquid,
then its surface tension decreases. If impurities are highly
soluble in liquid, then its surface tension increases.
Applications of Surface Tension
• When soap, detergent, dettol, phenyl etc., are mixed in water then its surface
tension decreases.
• When salt is added in water, its surface tension increases because addition of
solute into solvent may lead to an increase in surface tension, such
as salt in water and water in alcohol, due to solute depletion at the interface.
• When oil spreads over the surface of water, its surface tension decreases.
• When kerosene oil is sprinkled on water, its surface tension decreases. As a result,
the larva of mosquitoes floating on the surface of water dies due to sinking.
• Warm soup is tasty because at high temperature its surface tension is low and
consequently the soup spreads on all parts of the tongue.
Applications of Surface Tension
• Antiseptics like dettol have low surface tension and therefore it reaches in
the tiny cracks of the wound and cleans the germs and bacteria.
• The surface tension of soap solution in water is less than the surface
tension of pure water. Therefore, soap solution cleans greasy strains of
clothes better than pure water.
• Lubricating oil spread easily on all parts because of their low surface
tension.
• Dirt get removed when detergents are added while washing clothes
because surface tension of water is reduced.
Capillarity
• The phenomenon of rising or falling of liquid
column in a capillary tube (glass tube of very
fine bore) is called capillarity.
• Illustrations of capillarity
 1. A piece of blotting paper soaks ink
because the pores of the blotting paper
serve as capillary tubes.
 2. The oil in the wick of a lamp rises due
to capillary action of threads in the wick.
 3. The root hairs of plants draw water
from the soil through capillary action.
Capillarity
 4. To prevent loss of water due to capillary action, the soil is loosened
and split into pieces by the farmers.
 5. If a capillary tube is dipped in water in an artificial satellite, water
rises up to other end of tube because of its zero apparent weight, how
long the tube may be.
 6. Action of towel in soaking up water from the body is due to capillary
action of cotton in the towel.
 7. Melted wax, in a candle rises up to wick by capillary action.
Cohesive and Adhesive Forces
• Cohesive force: The intermolecular force of
attraction acting between the molecules of
same substance is called cohesive force.
 E.g., Intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of water,
mercury etc.
• Adhesive force: The intermolecular force of
attraction acting between the molecules of
different substance is called adhesive force.
 E.g., Intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of paper
and gum, paper and ink, etc.
Viscous force and Viscosity
• Viscous force: The force which opposes the relative motion between
different layers of liquid or gases is called viscous force.
• Viscosity: Viscosity is the property of a liquid by virtue of which it opposes
the relative motion between its different layers.
 Viscosity is the property of liquids and gases both.
 The viscosity of a liquid is due to cohesive force between its
molecules.
 The viscosity of a gas is due to diffusion of its molecules from one layer
to other layer.
Viscous force and Viscosity
 Viscosity of gases is much less than that of liquids. There is no viscosity
in solids.
 Viscosity of an ideal fluid is zero.
 With rise in temperature, viscosity of liquids decreases and that for
gases increases. (When temperature increases the energy level
of liquid molecules increases and the distance between the
molecule increases. It causes a decrease in intermolecular attraction
between them, which reduce viscosity.)
 Viscosity of a fluid is measured by its coefficient of viscosity. Its SI unit
is decapoise (kg/ms) or pascal second. It is generally denoted by η.
Stoke’s Law
• According to this law, the viscous force depends upon the coefficient of
viscosity, velocity of the moving object and its size. Or
• The force required to move a sphere through a given viscous fluid at a low
uniform velocity is directly proportional to the velocity and radius of the
sphere.
Terminal Velocity
• When a small spherical body falls through a long liquid column its velocity
increases gradually but later on it becomes constant, called terminal
velocity.
• The radius of spherical rain drops is very small therefore their terminal
velocity is also small, with which they strike the earth’s surface.
• When a liquid flow through a pipe, its speed is maximum near axis and
minimum near the walls of the pipe because fluid with in contact with
solid surface will resist the motion.
Equation of Continuity
• When a non-viscous liquid flows through a pipe of non-uniform crosssectional area in stream-lined flow, (i.e. velocity at every point in the fluid
remains constant) then at each section of the tube, the product of area of
cross-section of the pipe and velocity of liquid remains constant, i.e. A × v
= constant.
• Therefore speed (v) of fluid flow becomes faster in narrower pipe.
Bernoulli’s Theorem
• If a non-viscous and incompressible liquid
is flowing in stream-lined flow then total
energy, i.e., sum of pressure energy, kinetic
energy and potential energy, per unit
volume of the liquid remains constant.
• Venturi tube and aspirator pump works on
Bernoulli’s theorem.
• Venturi tube are used to measure the flow
speed of a fluid in a tube
• Aspirator pump is used to spray the liquid.
• According to Bernoulli's theorem, with
increase in velocity of liquid its pressure
decreases and vice-versa.
• Standing by the side of fast moving train is dangerous, due to the high velocity
of the train, pressure is low and there is flow of pressure (outside), from high
pressure to low pressure, and it can withdraw the man toward the high speed
train.
• Lift on an aircraft wing is based on Bernouli’s principle.
• During storms or cyclones, the roofs of the huts or tinned roofs blown off
because wind blows with very high speed over the top of the roof and
therefore pressure of air decreases.
• Due to the pressure difference of air above and below the roof, a lifting force
acts on the roof. If it is sufficient to balance the weight of the roof it starts to
fly off.
Magnus Effect
• Magnus Effect:
• The force exerted on a rapidly spinning
cylinder or sphere moving through air or
another fluid in a direction at an angle
to the axis of spin. This force is
responsible for the swerving of balls
when hit or thrown with spin.
• Motion of a Spinning Ball
• When swing bowlers deliver the ball,
the ball changes its plane of motion in
air.
Simple Harmonic Motion/ periodic motion:
• Any motion which repeats itself after regular interval of time is called
periodic or harmonic motion.
• Ex. Motion of hands of a clock, motion of earth around sun etc.
• Oscillatory motion: if a particle repeats its motion after a regular interval
of time about a fixed point, motion is said to be oscillatory or vibratory.
• Ex. Motion of a piston in engines.
• Time period: time taken in one complete oscillation.
• Frequency: number of oscillation completed by a body in unit interval of
time. Its SI unit is hertz. If n = frequency, T = time period, then n-1
• If a particle repeats its motion about a fixed point after regular interval of time in
such a way that at any moment the acceleration of the particle is directly
proportional to its displacement from the fixed point at that moment and is always
directed towards the fixed point.
• The fixed point is called mean point or equilibrium point.
• Characteristics : When a particle executing SHM passes through the mean position
• No force acts on the particle
• Acceleration of the particle is zero.
• Velocity is maximum.
• Kinetic energy is maximum .
• Potential energy is zero.
• When the particle executing SHM is at extreme end ,then
• 1. Acceleration is maximum
• 2. Restoring force acting on particle is maximum.
• 3. Velocity of particle is maximum.
• 4. Kinetic energy is zero.
• 5. Potential energy is maximum.
• Simple pendulum :
• Time period = T = 2π × √(L/g)
• Where l = length of pendulum.

Mauryas
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Rise of the Mauryas
• The last of the Nanda rulers, Dhana Nanda was highly
unpopular due to his oppressive tax regime.
• Also, post Alexander’s invasion of North-Western India, that
region faced a lot of unrest from foreign powers.
• Chandragupta, with the help of an intelligent and politically
astute Brahmin, Kautilya usurped the throne by defeating
Dhana Nanda in 321 BC.
Mauryan Empire
(321 – 184 BC)
• The Mauryan Empire
was spread from the
valley of the Oxus
(present Amu
River)/central asia to
the delta of Kaveri
Mauryan Empire (321 – 184 BC)
Chandragupta Maurya was the first ruler who unified entire India under one political
unit.
The detailed information about the administrative system of the Mauryan Empire is
mentioned in Arthashastra.
It is a book written by Kautilya. He was also known as Chanakya.
Kautilya was the Prime Minister of Chandragupta Maurya. He was considered as the
real architect of the Mauryan Empire.
Literary Sources

• Megasthene was a Greek ambassador in court
of Chandragupta maurya
• His book is survived in fragments & provides
detail about mauryan administration & military
organization, particularly of capital city
(Patliputra).
• He called Pataliputra as PolimBrotha. And it was
handled by six committees (each have 5
members).
Chandragupta Maurya
• The Hindu sources also say he was
a student of Kautilya of humble
birth (probably born to a Shudra
woman).
• Most Buddhist sources say he was
a Kshatriya.
• It is generally accepted that he was
an orphaned boy born into a
humble family who was trained by
Kautilya
Chandragupta Maurya
• The Buddhist literature, the ‘Mahavamsa’ and ‘Dipavamsa’ give a detail
account of Chandragupta Maurya.
• Chandragupta Maurya has been described as a descendant of the
Kshatriya clan of the Moriyas branch of Sakyas. They lived in Pipphalivana,
in eastern Uttar Pradesh.
• The ‘Mudrarakshasa’ is a play written by Vishakhadatta, referred
Chandragupta as ‘Vrishala’ and ‘Kulahina,’ which means a person of
humble origin.
Chandragupta Maurya
• Founded Mauryan Empire by
defeating Nandas with the help of
Kautilya
• In 305 BC, he marched against
Selucus Nikator (Alexanders
general controlling NW India) &
defeated him.
Chandragupta Maurya
• A treaty was signed, according to which, Selucus gave Chandragupta
eastern Afganisthan, Baluchistan & area west of Indus & in return
Chandragupta gifted 500 elephants to Selucus & married his daughter
Helen.
• Megasthenes was sent to Mauryan court as a Greek ambassador
• Greek writer Justin (Who wrote epitome) called Chandragupta
“Sandrocottus”
Chandragupta Maurya
• Chandragupta embraced Jainism towards the end of his life & stepped
down from the throne in favour of his son Bindusara & went to Mysore
along with Jain monks led by Bhadrabahu & starved himself to death.
• The Junagarh rock inscription describes that a dam for irrigation was
constructed on the Sudarshana Lake by Pushyagupta, a provincial
governor of Chandragupta Maurya.
• The Jain tradition confirms that in his old age, Chandragupta abdicated the
throne and retired to Shravanabelagola in Karnataka with his teacher
Bhadrabahu (a Jain ascetic).
Chandragupta Maurya
• Local inscriptions of the later
period mentioned that
Chandragupta gave up his life as a
Jaina devotee by fast unto death
at a hill, which later on called as
Chandragiri, seems to be named
after him.
Bindusara
• Was called “Amitragatha” i.e. Slayer of foes
by the Greeks.
• According to the Tibetan historian,
Taranath, Chanakya continued as a minister
of Bindusara after Chandragupta Maurya.
• Hemachandra, Jain scholar, also confirms
this fact.
• He opt the Ajivika sect ( founded by
Makkhali Gosala, major rival of Vedic,
Jainism and Buddhism)
• Conquered Deccan upto Mysore.
Bindusara
• Nikator’s successor Antiochus 1 replaced Megasthenes with Deimachus as
a Greek ambassador at mauryan court under Bindusara’s Patronage.
• Bindusara appointed his eldest son Sumana (or Susima) as his viceroy at
Taxila and Ashoka at Ujjain.
• It also mentions that when a revolt broke out at Taxila, Ashoka was sent to
restore peace as Susima fails to suppress it.
Ashoka
• According to the Buddhist tradition,
Janapada Kalyani or Subhadrangi was
his mother.
• He was appointed as a viceroy of Ujjain
and Taxila while he was a prince.
• Ashoka was very cruel in his early life
and captured the throne after killing his
99 brothers. But it appears an
exaggerated figure.
Ashoka
• At its zenith, Ashoka’s empire stretched
from Afghanistan in the west to
Bangladesh in the east. It covered
almost the whole Indian subcontinent
except present Kerala and Tamil Nadu,
and modern-day Sri Lanka.
• Ashoka built many edicts all over India
including in present-day Nepal and
Pakistan.
• His capital was at Pataliputra (Patna)
and had provincial capitals at Taxila and
Ujjain

Conversion to Buddhism
• The battle with Kalinga fought in 265 BC was personally led by Ashoka and
he was able to vanquish the Kalingas.
• According to Kharavela’s Hathigumpha inscriptions, the ruler of Kalinga
was Nandraja at the time of war.
• Whole cities were destroyed and more than a hundred thousand people
were killed in the war.
Conversion to Buddhism
• The horrors of war disturbed him so
much that he decided to shun
violence for the rest of his life and
turned to Buddhism.
• Ashoka’s 13th Rock Edict describes
the Kalinga war vividly.
Conversion to Buddhism
• He now became Dharmashoka (the pious Ashoka) from Chandashoka.

Independence of the provinces
Internal revolt
Foreign invasions
Ashoka’s policies
Brahminical reaction
• Kalhana, author of the work Rajatarangini which is an account of Kashmir’s history says
that after Ashoka’s death, his son Jalauka ruled over Kashmir as an independent ruler.
This partition resulted in invasions from the northwest.
• Kalinga became independent.

(Sophagasanus) began to rule over the north-western provinces independently.

Pushyamitra.
• foreign tribes attacked and established their kingdoms on Indian soil. The notable ones
were the Indo-Greeks, the Sakas and the Kushanas.
Mauryan Art
• No significant architectural remains have been found corresponding
to the period between the Harappans and the Mauryas.
• This is probably because buildings were not made of stone in this
period.

other natural calamities.
• Mauryan art represents an important transition in Indian art from
use of wood to stone.

th century BC, Mauryas established their power and by 3
rdcentury BC
Ashoka patronized Shraman tradition.

the relics and 9
th over the vessel in which the relics were originally
deposited.

at many places like Patna, Vidisha and Mathura.

with use of spoked wheel for the 1
st time after Indus valley

Delhi later)
Crime & Investigation

 In 1901 the Imperial Cadet Corps was set up.
Ancient Monuments Act, 1904

archaeological objects.
 The Act made it obligatory for the government & local bodies to preserve
monuments of archaeological importance
Sedition Act and the Official Secrets Act (1904)
 This act was passed mainly to curtail Indian press
 No work or procedures of government could be leaked to public
 If anyone divulges government secrets they were to be punished under this
act

The period from 1905 to 1917 was known as the era of extremism in the
Indian National Movement.
The extremists or the aggressive nationalists believed that success could
be achieved through bold means.
The important extremist leaders were Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar
Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh.
 Bal Gangadhar Tilak is regarded as the real founder of the popular
 anti-British movement in India.
 He was known as ‘Lokmanya’.
 He attacked the British through his weeklies ‘The Mahratta’ and the ‘Kesari’.
 Started Akharas, Lathi clubs and anti – cow killing societies to built his rapport
 Build up anti-imperialist sentiments among the public through Ganapati festivals
(started in 1893), Shivaji festivals (started in 1896)
 He was jailed twice by the British for his nationalist activities and in 1908 deported
to Mandalay for six years.
 Books : The Arctic Home of Vedas & Gita Rahasya
 He set up the Home Rule League in 1916 at Poona and declared “Swaraj is my
birth-right and I will have it.”
Lala Lajpat Rai
 popularly known as the ‘Lion of Punjab’ and ‘Punjab Kesari’ (no Link to the newspaper)
 He played an important role in the Arya Samaj and the Swadeshi Movement
 He founded the Indian Home Rule League in the US in 1916
 Deported to Mandalay on the ground of sedition in 1907
 Founded the : Servants of the People Society and National College, at Lahore
 He received fatal injuries while leading a procession against the Simon
Commission and died on November 17, 1928.
Bipin Chandra Pal
He began his career as a moderate and turned an extremist.
Prolific writer on nationalistic issues
Aurobindo Ghosh was another extremist leader who actively
participated in the Swadeshi Movement. He was also imprisoned. After
his release he settled in the French territory of Pondicherry and
concentrated on spiritual activities
Causes for the Rise of Extremism
 Failure of the Moderates to win any notable success other than the
expansion of the legislative councils by the Indian Councils Act (1892)
 During the great famines of 1896-97 and 1899-1900, British did not
take any serious famine relief measures (or failed at them).
Approximately 90 lakh people died; moderates were unable to force
British to take any measures.
 Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 in which Japan defeated a great
European power Russia.
 This encouraged Indians to fight against the European nation, Britain.
 The economic conditions of the people became worse
 The ill-treatment of Indians in South Africa on the basis of colour of
skin
The immediate cause for the rise of extremism was the reactionary rule
of Lord Curzon:
 He passed the Calcutta Corporation Act, (1899) reducing the Indian
control of this local body.
 The Universities Act (1904) reduced the elected members in the
University bodies. It also reduced the autonomy of the universities and
made them government departments.
 The Sedition Act and the Official Secrets Act reduced the freedoms of
all people.
 His worst measure was the Partition of Bengal (1905).
Main Objective of Extremists :
Their main objective was to attain Swaraj (self – rule) and not just better
governance from British.
*the exact definition of Swaraj/degree of independence was still vague. Became clear only in
1929 with the ‘Purna Swaraj’ resolution
Methods of the Extremists
 The Extremists had no faith in the British sense of justice and fair play.
 They pointed out the forceful means by which the British had taken control
of India.
 They believed that political rights will have to be fought for.
 They had the spirit of self-reliance and self determination.
The methods used by the extremists were:
1. Not cooperating with the British Government by boycotting government
courts, schools and colleges.
2. Promotion of Swadeshi and boycott of foreign goods.(economic aspect)
3. Introduction and promotion of nationalistic education
*University of Calcutta = Ghulam khana
The achievements of extremists can be summed up as follows:
1.They were the first to demand Swaraj as a matter of birth right.
2.They involved the masses in the freedom struggle and broadened the social base
of the National Movement.
3.They were the first to organize an all-India political movement, viz. the
Swadeshi Movement.

Monetary System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Monetary Policy
• It is the Component of Economic Policy through Which Central Bank
regulates Money Supply in an Economy
• It is the method through which the Central Bank regulates money
supply in the market
Objectives of Monetary Policy
• To Stimulate Economic Growth
• To Control Inflation
• Controlled Expansion Of Bank Credit
• Promotion of Fixed Investment
• Restriction of Inventories : The main objective of this policy is to avoid over-stocking
and idle money in the organization which leads to sickness of the organization.
• Promotion of Exports and Food Procurement Operations
• Desired Distribution of Credit
• Equitable Distribution of Credit
• To Promote Efficiency
• RBI reviews its monetary policy every two months.
Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC)
• Decides policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target
• The Central Government has notified 4 percent Consumer Price
Index (CPI) inflation as the target for the period from August 5,
2016, to March 31, 2021, with the upper tolerance limit of 6
percent and the lower tolerance limit of 2 percent.
• 4 Mandatory Meetings,
• Quorum- 4 Members
• 1 Member= 1 Vote, in the event of an equality, the Governor has a
second or casting vote.
Instruments of Monetary Policy
• Also known as Credit Control measures or Monetary Policy Measure
• Broadly classified into two types:-
 Quantitative or General Measures
 Qualitative or Selective Measures
• Difference between Quantitative and Qualitative measures
 1. Quantitative measures regulate the quantity of money supply
 2. Qualitative measures are sector specific
Quantitative Measures
• 1. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
 Percentage of bank deposits which the bank has to keep with
RBI
• 2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
 Percentage of bank deposits which the bank has to keep with
itself
 Cash
 Government Securities
 Gold
Quantitative Measures
• 2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
 Objectives of SLR
o 1. To ensure that bank should maintain sufficient cash with
themselves
o 2. To Induce Banks to buy Government Securities
• 3. Bank Rate
 Rate of interest at which RBI provides rediscounting facilities to
Banks against Commercial Paper.
Quantitative Measures
• 4. Open Market Operations (OMO)
 It is done by buying and selling Government Securities
 This is done by an auction process
 Another component of OMO is Liquidity Adjustment Facility.
 This is used to regulate the money supply in the country
 LAF is done by – Repo and Reverse Repo Rate
Quantitative Measures
Repo Rate – RBI lends money to Banks by buying government
securities
 RBI only fixes Repo rate, Reverse Repo is automatically adjusted
to 1% point below the Repo rate.
E.g. – If Repo Rate is changed to 8% Reverse Repo Rate will be
automatically adjusted to 7%
o Reverse Repo Rate – At this rate banks buy government securities
from RBI
• When Repo and reverse Repo increases, Money Supply in the market
decreases and when Repo and reverses Repo decreases Money Supply in
the market increases.
Quantitative Measures
• Per cent v/s Per cent Point
 1 per cent point = 100 basis point
 i.e. 10% + 1% point = 10+1 = 11%
 whereas 10% + 1% = 10+0.1 = 10.1%
• Cash Management Bills (CMB) to suck excess liquidity.
• While the money thus collected is not part of Govt.’s borrowing, but
Govt. pays interest on it.
• This mechanism was enhanced during Demonetization to counter
excess liquidity and crashing of lending rates.
Quantitative Measures
• 5. Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)
 Banks can borrow loan up to 1% on their deposits.
 Interests will be 1% point above Repo Rate and it will be based
on day to day basis.
 This facility is created to facilitate borrowing from RBI by banks
who do not haven extra government securities and pledging the
existing securities will affect their SLR requirements of 23%.
 Objective was to overcome liquidity crunch with banks i.e.
shortage of funds.
Qualitative Measures
• 1. Credit Rationing
 Quota of credit, i.e. priority sector to get 40% of total credit.
 Priority sector includes:-
o Agricultural Sector (18% of total credit)
o Weaker Sections
o Small Scale Industry
 For Foreign banks priority sector cap is 32% of total credit
Qualitative Measures
 Priority sector includes Exports, Small Scale Industries, Housing
Sector, Education Loan
 M.V Nair committee in 2012 recommended that quota for
foreign banks should be increased to 40%
• 2. Margin Requirements
 Difference between the market value of a collateral security and
the maximum amount of loan sanctioned against that security
by a bank in a particular sector
Qualitative Measures
• 3. Differential Rate of Interest
 Different rate of interest for different sectors to increase the flow of
credit to those sectors like agriculture sector, small scale industries
• 4. Other Measures
 Moral Suasion - “Persuasion” without applying punitive measures. RBI
governor tries this tactic via conferences, informal meetings, letters,
seminars, convocation, panel discussion, memorial lectures. -
Example, Governor asking Banks to transmit rate cuts, open new
branches in rural areas, spread financial literacy, give loans to farmers
beyond PSL quota etc.
Qualitative Measures
• Similarly, Governor asking CM/FM to control fiscal deficit & subsidy
leakage to enhance the impact of RBI’s monetary policy.
 Direct Action like Penalty or Sanctions
• RBI can punish banks (and even non-banks) for not complying with
its directives under RBI Act 1934, Banking Regulation Act 1949,
Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 ,
• Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002, Foreign Exchange
Management Act (FEMA) 1999.
Types of Monetary System
1. Contractionary Monetary Policy or Dear Money Policy
• It is pursued to control Inflation  CRR is increased. Due to this increase
lending capacity of the banks decrease  SLR is also increased  Bank
rate is increased. This leads to RBI charging higher rate of interest on bank
lending due to which banks borrow less from RBI.  Repo Rate is
increased  Reverse Repo Rate is also increased. This leads to, RBI paying
more interest on Banks deposits. Thus Banks prefer to deposit extra
money with RBI instead of giving loans to public.  It is called Dear
Money Policy as loans get expensive for the public
Bank Rate and Repo Rate
• Difference between Bank Rate and Repo Rate
 Bank rate is that interest rate at which banks borrow from RBI
against First Class Securities, Securities of private companies and
re-discounting.
 Repo Rate is that rate at which Banks borrow from RBI against
Government Securities
Types of Monetary System
2. Expansionary Monetary Policy or Cheap Money Supply
• This policy is adopted to increase money supply in the economy in
order to stimulate economic growth.
• It is also pursued to overcome recession.
• CRR, SLR, Repo Rate, Re Repo Rate, Bank Rate should be reduced.
• It is called Cheap Money policy as interest rates are low thus
borrowing money becomes cheap. Since 2010 RBI has adopted
Contractionary Money Policy. In 2009 to stimulate economic growth
after global recession, RBI adopted Expansionary Monetary Policy.

Secretary of State for India - Edwin Montagu
Governor General and Viceroy - Lord Chelmsford
The most notable feature of the act was ‘end of benevolent despotism’ (तानाशाही)
and introduction of responsible government in India.
 On 20 August 1917, S.o.S. Montagu made a historic declaration in the House of
Commons in British Parliament which is called “Montagu declaration”.
 In November 1917, Montague had visited India to ascertain views from all
sections of polity
 A detailed report on Constitutional Reforms in India {Mont-Ford Report} was
published on 8th July, 1918. This report became the basis of Government of India
Act 1919.
* INC held a Special Session, with Syed Hasan Imam as president , in August 1918
– to discuss the report
 Key features of this report were as follows:
1. Increasing association of Indians in every branch of administration.
2. Gradual development of self governing institutions with a view to the
progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral
part of the British empire.
3. Progress towards responsible government in successive stages
Highlights of the 1919 Act
 India to remain as an integral part of British Empire.
 Gradual decentralization of authority with loosening the supreme hold of the
central government. (suggested for a decentralized, but unitary form of
government)
 The time and manner towards goal of responsible government will be decided
by the British Parliament.
 Partial responsibility in provinces to Indians , but no change in character of the
central government.
 1. Executive:
• Dyarchy was introduced, i.e., there were two classes of administrators – Executive
councillors and ministers.
• The Governor was the executive head of the province.
• The subjects were divided into two lists – reserved and transferred.
A. Reserved list
The governor was in charge of the reserved list along with his executive councillors.
The subjects under this list were law and order, irrigation, finance, land revenue, etc.
B. Transferred list
The ELECTED members of council were in charge of subjects under the transferred
list. The subjects included were education, local government, health, excise,
industry, public works, religious endowments, etc.
• The ministers were responsible to the people who elected them through the
legislature.
• These ministers were nominated from among the elected members of the
legislative council.
• The executive councillors were not responsible to the legislature unlike the
ministers.
• The Secretary of State and the Governor-General could interfere in matters under
the reserved list but this interference was restricted for the transferred list.
 2. Legislature:
• The size of the provincial legislative assemblies was increased. Now about 70% of
the members were elected.
• There were communal and class electorates.
• Direct elections of members (but restricted franchise)
• Some women could also vote.
• Legislators enjoyed Freedom of speech
• The governor’s assent was required to pass any bill. He also had veto power and
could issue ordinances also.
 1. Executive
• The chief executive authority was the Governor-General/Viceroy.
• There were two lists for administration – central and provincial.
• Provincial list was under the provinces while the centre took care of the central
list.
• Out of the 8 members of the Viceroy’s executive council, 3 were to be Indian
members.
• The governor-general could issue ordinances.
• He could also certify bills that were rejected by the central legislature.
• He retained the power to summon and dissolve the House
 2. Legislature
• A bicameral legislature was set up with two houses
 Legislative Assembly - Lower House (forerunner of the Lok Sabha)
 Council of State - Upper House (forerunner of the Rajya Sabha)
 The nominated members
were nominated by the
governor-general from
Anglo-Indians and Indian
Christians.
 The members had a tenure
of 3 years. (could be
extended by GG)
Members of the
Legislative Assembly
 Only male members
 Tenure of 5 years.(some
seats vacant every year)
 Members of the Council of
State:
Who could vote for these elections?
Franchise was restricted
Voters should have paid land revenue of 50 Rs annually
OR
have property worth 180 Rs. rental
OR
have been paying income tax (of Rs. 2000)
Further for council of state – only titleholders, ex members of council and Uni.
senate members were eligible
All this narrowed the number of people who could vote to an abysmal number.
For Lower House – 9 lakh
For Upper House – 17 Thousand
 The legislators could ask questions and also vote a part of the budget.
 Only 25% of the budget was subject to vote.
 Rest was non-votable.
 A bill had to passed in both houses before it became a law.
 There were three measures to resolve any deadlock between both the houses –
joint committees, joint conferences and join sittings.
Governor-General
• The governor-general’s assent was required for any bill to become a law even
if both houses have passed it.
• He could also enact a bill without the legislature’s consent.
• He could prevent a bill from becoming law if he deems it as detrimental to
the peace of the country.
• He could disallow any question, adjournment motion or debate in the house.
Indian Council
 There were to be at least 8 and a maximum of 12 members in the council.
 Half of the members should have ten years of experience in public service in
India.
 Indian members in the Council INCREASED from 2 to 3
 It also created an office of the High Commissioner for India (to act as the agent
of GG of India in London)
 The salary of S.o.S for India to be paid by Govt of Britain now.
Other salient features
 This act provided for the first time, the establishment of a public service
commission in India.
 The act also provided that after 10 years, a statutory commission would be set up
to study the working of the government. This resulted in the Simon Commission
of 1927.
 The GOI act 1919 marked the end of the policy of benevolent despotism, and
thus began the genesis of the responsible government in India.
 Dyarchy introduced the concept of responsible government.
 It introduced the concept of federal structure with a unitary bias.
 There was increased participation of Indians in the administration. They held
some portfolios like labour, health, etc.
 For the first time, elections were known to the people and it created a political
consciousness among the people.
 Some Indian women also had the right to vote for the first time.
 This act extended and consolidated communal representation.
 Franchise was very limited - Only those people who had property, taxable
income & paid high land revenue were entitled to vote
 The governor-general and the governors had a lot of power to undermine the
legislatures at the centre and the provinces respectively.
 Allocation of the seats for the central legislature was not based on population
but the ‘importance’ of the province in the eyes of the British.
NOTE - The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919 which severely restricted press and
movement of people . Despite the unanimous opposition of Indian members of
the legislative council, the bills was passed. Several Indian members resigned in
protest.
 No specific time frame was given
 The Government alone was to decide the nature and the timing of advance
towards a responsible government
 The Indians were resentful that the British would decide what was good and
what was bad for Indians

Montesque Chelmsford
Reforms
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Montesque Chelmsford Reforms
• Montague-Chelmsford Report, which formed the basis of the Government of India Act
1919, was published on 8
th July 1918.
• This act embodied the reforms recommended in the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms and
covered a ten years period from 1919 to 1929.
• Edwin Montague was appointed the Secretary of State for India in 1917 and remained in
that office till 1922. He was critical of the manner in which India was governed.
• The Montagu declaration reads as:
• “Increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual
development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realization
of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire“.
• The key phrase “ultimate self-government” was removed but, still the another key
phrase “responsible government” in this statement gave the inference for the first time
that rulers are answerable to the public.
• The declaration made the moderates happy and they said “It is Magna Carta of India”. However
extremists expressed that it fell short for legitimate expectations of India. After all, total
independence was what they wanted.
• On 20th August 1917, Montague presented the historic Montague Declaration (August
Declaration) in the British Parliament. This declaration proposed the increased participation of
Indians in the administration and the development of self-governing institutions in India.
• In 1917, Montague visited India and held talks with the various representatives of Indian polity
including Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
• He, along with the Governor-General of India Lord Chelmsford, brought out a detailed report
titled Constitutional Reforms in India, also called the Montague-Chelmsford Report. This report
was published on 8
th July 1918.
• This report became the basis for the Government of India Act 1919 (alternatively called the
Montague-Chelmsford Reforms or Montford Reforms).
• The report was rejected by most Indian leaders. Annie Besant referred to it as ‘unworthy to be
offered by England or to be accepted by India’.
Principal provisions of the GOI Act 1919
 Diarchy was introduced in the form of two classes of administrators namely, the Executive
Councillors and the Ministers.
 The governor was the executive head of the provincial government.
 The subjects were classified into two lists – reserved and transferred. The reserved list was
under the governor and the councillors and the transferred list was under the ministers.
 The reserved list consisted of subjects like finance, law and order, irrigation, etc. and the
transferred list consisted of items like education, health, public works, religious endowments,
etc.
 The ministers were nominated from the elected members of the Legislative Council. They
were responsible to the legislature whereas the councillors were not answerable to the
legislature.
 The size of the legislative assemblies was expanded with about 70% of the members being
elected.
 At the central government level, the Governor-General was the chief executive authority.
 The governor had the veto power over the council. He could also issue ordinances.
 The communal representation was extended and Sikhs, Europeans and Anglo Indians were
included. The Franchise (Right of voting) was granted to the limited number of only those who paid
certain minimum “Tax” to the government. Even some women could vote
 This report introduced the bicameral legislature with 2 houses – Legislative Assembly (forerunner of
the Lok Sabha) and the Council of State (forerunner of the Rajya Sabha).
 The viceroy’s executive council had 6 members out of which 3 were to be Indians.
 The viceroy could issue ordinances and also certify bills that were rejected by the legislature.
 Even though elections were introduced, the franchise was partial in nature, not universal. Only
certain people who were propertied or had titles or held office could vote.
 The act provided for the establishment of a public service commission for the first time.
 It also produced an office of the High Commissioner for India in London.
• The report was important in that for the first time, concrete steps were taken to include more Indians in
the administration of their own country.

Mountains
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Mountains
• Endogenic forces and exogenic forces can create a lot of landforms.
• Examples include Mountains, Plateaus, and Plains.
• Orogeny (Geology) is a process in which a section of the earth’s
crust is folded and deformed by lateral compression to form a
mountain range.
• Orogenic movements are ‘Tectonic movements’ of the earth which
involve the folding of sediments, faulting and metamorphism
Mountains
• Nearly 27% of the world’s land surface is covered
by mountains.
• It is from the mountains that up to 80% of the
planet’s fresh surface water come from.
CLASSIFICATION OF MOUNTAINS
• The mountains, on the basis of their mode of
formation, can be classified as:
• Fold mountains
• Block mountains
• Volcanic mountains/Accumulated Mountains
• Residual Mountains/ Relict Mountains
Fold Mountains
• Fold Mountains
• Mountain ranges mainly consisting of uplifted folded
sedimentary rocks are called Fold Mountains.
• They are formed due to the force of
compression arising from the endogenic or internal
forces.
• Synclines (trough) and anticlines (crest) are part of Fold
Mountains.
• They are the loftiest (tall) mountains.
• Fold mountains can be divided into two broad types on the basis of the nature of folds.
 Simple fold mountains
 Complex fold mountains
• On the basis of period of origin, fold mountains are divided into
• very old fold mountains,
• old fold mountains and
• Alpine fold mountains.
• Simple fold mountains
 Simple fold mountains with open folds in which welldeveloped systems of synclines and anticlines are
found and folds are of wavy patterns.
• Complex fold mountains
 Complex fold mountains in which the rock strata are
intensely compressed to produce a complex structure
of folds.
 In the Himalayas, recumbent folds are often found
detached from their roots and carried few hundred
kilometres away by the tectonic forces.
Fold Mountains
Very Old Fold Mountains
• They are more than 500 million years old.
• Rounded features (due to denudation).
• Low elevation.
• The Appalachians in North America and
the Ural mountains in Russia.
Old Fold Mountains
• They are also called as Thickening relict
fold mountains because of lightly
rounded features and medium
elevation.
• Top layers worn out due to erosional
activity.
• Example: Aravali Range in India.
• The Aravali Range in India are
the oldest fold mountain systems in
India.
Alpine or young fold mountains
• Examples are the Rockies,
the Andes, the Alps, the
Himalayas, etc.
• Characteristics are:
• Rugged relief,
• Imposing height (lofty),
• High Conical Peaks.
Characteristics of Fold Mountains
• Fold mountains belong to the group of youngest mountains of the
earth.
• Fold mountains extend for great lengths whereas their width is
considerably small.
• Fold mountains are found along continental margins facing oceans.
• Recurrent seismicity is a common feature in folded mountain belts .
• They also contain rich mineral resources such as tin, copper, gold.
Block Mountains
• Block Mountains are also formed by the
internal or endogenic earth movements
which cause the force of tension and
faulting.
• The down-lifting or uplifting of land in
between two parallel faults results in the
formation of Block Mountains.
• A block mountain is also called
as Horst and the rift valley formed as a
result of faulting is called Graben.
• Examples : The Great African Rift Valley
(valley floor is graben), Rift valley in
satpura and vindyas mountains, Black
Forest Mountains in Germany.
Volcanic mountains
• Volcanoes which are built up from material
ejected from fissures in the earth’s crust.
• The mountains formed by the accumulation
of volcanic materials are called as Volcanic
Mountains or Mountains of accumulation.
• Examples:
• Mount Mauna Loa in Hawaii Island,
• Mount Popa in Myanmar,
• Fuji Yama in Japan etc are some examples.
• Kilimanjaro in Africa
Residual mountains or Relict Mountains
• Weathering acts upon the earth’s crust
constantly.
• So, in some cases, some portions of an
elevated area escape from the process of
weathering due to the hardness of the
materials it is made of.
• These portions remain unweathered while
its surrounding area gets eroded constantly.
This results in the formation of Residual or
Relict Mountains.
• Examples: Hills like Nilgiri, Palkonda,
Parasnath and Rajmahal and Mountains like
the Aravalli, the Vindhya, and the Satpura
are some of the examples of Relict
Mountains in India.
Important mountain ranges

Atlee’s Declaration – February 20, 1947
 The Prime Minister of Britain, Clement Atlee declared on February 20, 1947
in the House of Commons that the British would quit India after transferring
power into the responsible hand not later than June 1948.
 The idea was that the Indians should settle their issues before that.
 He also announced the appointment of Lord Mountbatten as Viceroy in
place of Lord Wavell.
Plan Balkan/Dickie Bird Plan
 Between March and May of 1947, Mountbatten decided that the Cabinet Mission
Plan had become untenable and formulated an alternative plan.
 This plan envisaged the transfer of power to separate provinces
 Punjab and Bengal were given the option to vote for partition of their provinces.
 The various units thus formed along with the princely states would have the option
of joining India or Pakistan or remaining separate.
 The plan was quickly abandoned after Nehru reacted violently to it.
Mountbatten Plan/3 June Plan (June 1947)
 Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan appeared inevitable to
Mountbatten.
 Prime Minister Atlee announced the Partition Plan or June 3 Plan in the House of
Commons.
 The plan laid down the following provisions.
 India to be divided into India and Pakistan.
 Bengal and Punjab will be partitioned - The provincial legislative Assemblies of
Bengal and Punjab would meet in two parts separately, one representing Muslim
majority districts and another representing the Hindu Majority districts to decide
by the vote on partition.
 In case of Sind and Baluchistan, the provincial assemblies would take the
decision.
 In case of NWFP, the decision had to be taken on the base of referendum.
 A referendum was to be organized in Sylhet region of Assam which was
Muslim majority.
 There would be a separate constituent assembly for Pakistan to frame its
constitution.
 The Princely states would enjoy the liberty to join either India or Pakistan or
ever remain independent.
 August 15, 1947, was date fixed for handling over power to India and Pakistan.
 The Congress and the Muslim League ultimately approved the Mountbatten
Plan.
Indian Independence Act 1947
 British Government accorded formal approval to the Mountbatten Plan by enacting
the Indian Independence Act on 18 July 1947.
 The salient features of this Act were –
 Partition of the country into India and Pakistan would come into effect from 15
August 1947.
 British Government would transfer all powers to these two Dominions.
 A Boundary Commission would demarcate the boundaries of the provinces of the
Punjab and Bengal.
 Act provided for the transfer of power to the Constituent Assemblies of the two
Dominions to frame their respective Constitutions.
 Radcliffe Boundary Commission drew the boundary line separating India and
Pakistan.
 On 15th August 1947 India, and on the 14th August Pakistan came into existence as
two independent states.
 Lord Mountbatten was made the first Governor General of Independent India.
 Mohammad Ali Jinnah became the first Governor General of Pakistan.(Head of
state – British Monarch till 1956)

 4 lakh people died in riots
 Millions displaced
 Greatest man made cause for migration
 Humanitarian crisis
 At the time of independence, there were 562 small and big princely states in
India except Jammu and Kashmir, Junagarh and Hyderabad
 Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the first home minister, used the iron hand in this
regard.
 By August 15, 1947, all the states, with few exceptions like Jammu & Kashmir,
Hyderabad and Junagarh had signed the Instruments of Accession.
**Goa was with the Portuguese and Pondicherry with the French.

 Birkenhead’s Challenge
On the protests and rejection of Simon Commission by Indian politicians,
Lord Birkenhead , the S.o.S. for India, challenged Indians to form their own
constitution or framework for India’s political reforms , based on consensus
from all communities (Hindus,Muslims,Sikhs ,etc) and political groups
Nehru Report 1928
 To answer to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, an All Parties Conference led
by INC met in February 1928
 They appointed a subcommittee under the chairmanship of Motilal
Nehru to draft a constitution. (J.N. Nehru was the secretary)
 This was the first major attempt by Indians to draft a constitutional
framework for the country.
 The report was finalised by August 1928.
Major Recommendations of Nehru Report
 Dominion status on lines of self-governing dominions. (within a year)
 There should be federal form of government with residuary powers vested in
the centre.
 Rejection of separate electorates which had been the basis of constitutional
reforms so far.
 Linguistic provinces
 Nineteen fundamental rights including equal rights for women, right to form
unions, and universal adult suffrage.
 Full responsible government at the centre along with Autonomy to the provinces
 A bicameral legislature at the centre
 Clear cut division of power between the centre and provinces
 Full protection to cultural and religious interests of Muslims & Complete
dissociation of state from religion
Response to Nehru Report
 Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha and the Sikh communalists were unhappy
about the Nehru Report
 The younger section of the Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash
Bose were also angry over dominion status
 Instead, they demanded that the Congress adopt Purna Swaraj or complete
independence as its goal.
 With few exceptions, Muslim League leaders rejected the Nehru proposals.
 In reaction, Mohammad Ali Jinnah drafted his Fourteen Points in 1929
which became the core demands the Muslim community put forward as the
price of their participating in an independent united India.
According to Mohammad Ali Jinnah, “The Committee has adopted a
narrow minded policy to ruin the political future of the Muslims.
I regret to declare that the report is extremely ambiguous and does not
deserve to be implemented.”
The inability of Congress to concede these points must be considered a
major factor in the eventual partition of India’’
 In the All parties meeting at Calcutta in December 1928, Jinnah moved
certain amendments to the Nehru Report. But these amendments were not
accepted by Congress. So Jinnah refused to participate further in the
conference.
 A few days later, there was a Muslim All Parties conference was held in Delhi,
in which the nationalist Muslims attended and formulated a series of
demands on behalf of the Muslims of the Country.
 In this All Muslim Parties conference, it was made clear that no
constitution, by whomsoever proposed or devised, would be acceptable to
the Muslims of the country, unless it conformed with those demands.
 At the same time Jinnah after consulting the Muslim leaders formulated the
“Fourteen Points” for safeguarding the rights and interests of the Muslims in
any future constitution of the country.
 Here are these 14 points:
1. The form of the future constitution should be Federal, with the residuary
power vested in the provinces.
2. A Uniform measure of the autonomy shall be granted to all provinces.

Khilaafat Movement (1919–22)
 Chief cause → Defeat of Turkey in the First World War, Dethroning of the
Ottoman Emperor who was the Khalifa of Islamic world & harsh terms of the
Treaty of Sevres (1920)
 Treaty terms was felt by the Muslims as a great insult to them
 Whole movement was based on the Muslim belief that the Caliph (the Sultan
of Turkey) was the religious head of the Muslims all over the world.
Prominent leaders of this movement
 Maulana Mohd.Ali and Sahukat Ali Jauhar (Jauhar Brothers )
 Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
 Mukhtar Ansari
 Saifuddin Kitchlew
 Subsequently, the Khilaafat Movement merged with the Non-Cooperation
Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920.
 Ultimately ,Mustafa Kemal Ataturk abolished the office of Sultan/Caliph .
 He overthrew the Ottoman rule to establish a pro-Western, secular republic in
independent Turkey.
Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)
 Started by Gandhiji (NOT congress) on 1st August 1920
 Aim :
1. Swaraj
2. Justice for Jalianwalla Bagh massacre
3. Supporting Khilaafat Movement
 It was approved by the INC at the Nagpur session in December, 1920.
 *(Amendment in INC constitution)
Special Features of NCM
 Movement began with Mahatma Gandhi renouncing the medals given by the
British
 Surrender of titles and honorary positions along with resignation of membership
from the local bodies
 Boycott of elections held under the provisions of the 1919 Act
 Legislatures were boycotted, No leader of the Congress came forward to contest
the elections for the Legislatures.
 Boycott of government functions, courts, government schools and colleges
 Boycott of foreign goods and Popularizing Swadeshi goods and Khadi
 People were asked not to serve in the British army.
 Establishment of national schools, colleges and private panchayat courts
 The movement was essentially a peaceful and non-violent protest against the
British government in India.
 It was also planned that if the above steps did not bring results, people would
refuse to pay their taxes.
 The INC also demanded Swaraj or self-government.
 The non-cooperation movement was a decisive step in the independence
movement because for the first time, the INC was ready to forego
constitutional means to achieve self-rule.
 Gandhiji had assured that Swaraj would be achieved in a year if this movement
was continued to completion.
 On 5
th Feb. 1922 , in Chauri Chaura, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, a violent mob
set fire to a police station killing 22 policemen during a clash between the police
and protesters
 Gandhiji called off the movement on 12 February, 1922 in the wake of the Chauri
Chaura incident.
 Gandhiji said people were not ready for revolt against the government
through ahimsa.
 A lot of leaders like Motilal Nehru and C R Das were against the suspension of
the movement only due to sporadic incidents of violence.
*Gandhiji jailed for 2 years after the suspension
 Swaraj was not achieved in one year as Gandhiji had told.
 However, it was truly a mass movement where Lakhs of Indians
participated in the open protest against the government through peaceful
means.
 It shook the British government who were stunned by the extent of the
movement.
 It saw participation from both Hindus and Muslims thereby showcasing
communal harmony in the country.

as a result of the boycott of British goods.
 Khadi and Charkha was promoted.
 The import of sugar from Britain reduced considerably during this period.
 This movement also established Gandhiji as a leader of the masses.

Atomic and
Nuclear Physics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

ATOMIC PHYSICS
• Atom is the smallest part of matter which takes part in chemical reactions.
• Atoms consists of three particles electron, proton and neutron.
• All protons and neutrons are present in central core of atom called
nucleus.
• Electrons revolve around the nucleus.
• In an atom, electrons and protons are equal in number and have equal
and opposite charge. Hence, atom is neutral.
• Properties of fundamental particles:
• Particle Discoverer Mass (kg) Charge (coulomb)
• proton Rutherford 1.672 x 10-27 +1.6 x 10-19
• Neutron J Chadwick 1.675 x 10-27 0
• electron J.J Thomson 9.108 x 10-31 -1.6 x 1019
• Proton was discovered by Goldstein and named by Rutherford
• Subatomic Particles
• Positron: Antiparticle of electron, (+1.6*10-19 Coulomb) - discovered by
Anderson
• Neutrino: has 0 mass and 0 charge - discovered by pauli.
• Photon: mass 0 and charge 0 and velocity equal to that of light.
• Cathode Rays
• Cathode rays, discovered by Sir William Crooke.
• These are travel in straight lines.
• These produce fluorescence.(emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or
other electromagnetic radiation)
• These can produce through thin foils of metal and deflected by both electric and
magnetic fields.
• These have velocity ranging 1/30th to 1/10th of the velocity of light.
• Positive or Canal Rays
• Canal rays were discovered by Goldstein.
• These ray consists of positively charged particles.
• These travel in straight line.
• These rays are deflected by electric and magnetic fields.
• These ray can produce ionization in gases.
• X-Rays
• These are discovered by Roentgen.
• These are electromagnetic waves with wavelength range 0.1A-100A.
• These travel in straight line.
• Long exposures of X-rays injurious for human body.
• X-rays shows photoelectric effect. (electromagnetic radiation is made of a series of
particles called photons. When a photon hits an electron on a metal surface, the electron
can be emitted. The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons.)
• Uses of X-Rays
• In medical science these are used in surgery for detection of fracture, diseased
organs, foreign like bullet, stone etc. They are used in treatment of cancer and in
skin disease.
• In engineering, X-rays are used in detecting faults, cracks, flaws and gas pockets in
the finished metal products and in heavy metal sheets.
• In scientific work, X-rays are used in studying crystal structure and complex
molecules.
• In custom Department X-rays are used in custom department for detection of
banned materials which are kept hidden.
•
Radioactivity
• Radioactivity is the sending out of harmful radiation or particles, caused when atomic
nuclei breakup spontaneously.
• It was discovered by Henry Becquerel, Madame Curie and Pierre Curie for which they
jointly win noble prize.
• The nucleus having protons 83 or more are unstable.
• They emit alpha, Beta and gamma (y) particles and becomes stable.
• Robert Pierre and his wife Madame Curie discovered a new radioactive element radium.
• The Ray emitted by radioactive were first recognized by Rutherford.
• The end product of all the radioactive substance is lead.
• Madame Curie and Pierre Curie has discovered a new radioactive element is Radium.
• Radioactivity is detected by G.M. Counter.
• The time in which half nuclei of the element is decayed is fossils and
plants then it is called half life of the radioactive substance.
• Average life or mean life of a radioactive element is the ratio of total life of
all the atoms and total number of atoms present initially in the sample.
• Relation between half life and average life :
• Average life = 1.44 * half life
Applications of Radioactivity
• Radioactive Carbon-14 is used to measure the age of once living
organisms, such as plant or an animal and is called Radiocarbondating.
• Uranium dating: To find out the age of older but non living things like
rocks etc.
• In Agriculture : Using the tracer technique the fertilizer consumption of
plants can be measured. A radioisotopes is mixed with fertilizer before
application. When the plants start growing , their intake of fertilizer ca be
measured with the help of GM ounter,
• Gamma rays are used for sterilising foodstuffs and controlling insects
pests.
• Nuclear Fission
• Atom Bomb is based on nuclear fission. U-235 an P-239 are used for fissionable
material.
• Nuclear fission was first demonstrated by Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.
• Chain reaction
• When uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons, fission takes place. With
fission of each uranium nucleus, 3 neutrons and large amount of energy is
released. These neutrons cause further fission causing a chain reaction.
• Types of chained reaction:
• Uncontrolled chain reaction: In each fission reaction, three more neutrons are
produced.
• These 3 neutrons may cause the fission of three other U235 nuclei producing 9
neutrons and so on.
• The number of neutron goes on increasing till the whole fissionable material is
consumed.
• The energy proceeds very quickly and a huge amount of energy is liberated in a
short time.
• Atomic Bomb: Atomic bomb is based on nuclear fission. U235 and Pu239 are used
as fissionable material.
• The bomb was first used by USA against japan in second world war in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki on 6th august 1945 and 9 august 1945 with name little man and fat
man respectively
•
• Controlled Chain Reaction:
• A fission chain reaction which proceeds slowly without any explosion and in which
the energy released can be controlled.
• In this situation only one of the neutrons produced in each fission is able to cause
further fission.
• The rate of reaction remains constant.
• Nuclear reactors: Nuclear reactor is an arrangement in which controlled nuclear
fission takes place.
• First nuclear reactor was established in Chicago University under the supervision of
Prof. Fermi.
• Nuclear Fusion
• When two or more nuclei combine together to form heavier nucleus is
called as nuclear fusion.
• For nuclear fusion, a temperature of the order of 10^8K is required.
Hydrogen bomb was made by American Scientist in 1952. This is based on
nuclear fusion. It is 1000 times more powerful than atom bomb.
• The energy released by sun and other stars is by nuclear fusion.
• Mass energy relation:
• In 1905 Einstein established a relation between mass and energy on the
basis of theory of relativity.
• According to this relation, mass can be converted into energy and vice
versa.
• E= mc2.
• Here E is energy equivalent to mass m and c is the speed of light.
Nuclear Reactors
• Nuclear reactor is an arrangement, in which controlled nuclear fission
reaction takes place.
• First nuclear reactor was established in Chicago University under the
supervision of Prof Enrico Fermi.
• Heavy water, graphite and beryllium oxide are used to slow down the fast
moving neutrons. They are called moderate.

Uses of Nuclear Reactor
• (i) To produce electrical energy from the energy released during fission.
• (ii) To produce different isotopes, this can be used medical, physical and
agriculture science.
• A nuclear reactor is a device that contains and controls sustained nuclear chain
reactions.
• In nuclear reactors, the nuclear fission is controlled by controlling the number of
neutrons released during the fission.
• The energy liberated in a controlled manner is used to produce steam, which can
run turbines and produce electricity.
Fuel
• Fuel - (uranium 235, Plutonium-239)
• The fissionable material is used in the reactor along with a small
neutron source.
• The solid fuel is made into rods and is called fuel rods.
Role of extra neutron
• These neutrons in turn can initiate fission processes, producing still more
neutrons, and so on.
• This starts a chain reaction. Slow neutrons (thermal neutrons) are much more
likely to cause fission in U92 235 than fast neutrons.
• Fast neutrons liberated in fission would escape instead of causing another fission
reaction.
• If the chain reaction is uncontrolled, it leads to explosive energy output, as in a
nuclear bomb or Atom bomb.
• Each time an atom splits, it releases large amounts of energy in the form of heat.
• Moderators -(water, heavy water (D2O) and graphite) Light nuclei called
moderators are provided along with the fissionable nuclei for slowing down fast
neutrons.
• Core - The core of the reactor is the site of nuclear fission. It contains the fuel
elements in suitably fabricated form.
• Reflector-The core is surrounded by a reflector to reduce leakage. The energy
(heat) released in fission is continuously removed by a suitable coolant.
• Coolant - (water, heavy-water, liquid sodium, helium, Liquid oxygen). The coolant
transfers heat produced during fission to a working fluid which in turn may
produce steam. The steam drives turbines and generates electricity.
• Control rods- (cadmium, Boron). The reactor can be shut down by means of rods
(made of, for example, cadmium, Boron) that have high absorption of capacity of
neutrons. cadmium and boron can absorb neutrons to form the corresponding
isotopes, which are not radioactive.
• Shield - The whole assembly is shielded with heavy steel or concrete to check
harmful radiation from coming out.
• Use of Nuclear Reactor
• To produce electrical energy from the energy during fission.
• To produce different isotopes, this can be used medical, physical and
agriculture science
• Thermal Reactor :
• The nuclear reactor in which energy is produced by he fission of U-235 by
slow moving neutrons, are called Thermal reactors.
• Breeder Reactor:
• The nuclear reactor in which energy is produced by the fission of Pu239 or
U233 are called breeder reactors.
• Pu239 is produced from U238 and U233 is produced from Th235.
Some important facts
• Breath Analyzer:
• It is a device used by police to detect and catch people driving under the influence
of alcohal.
• Infrared radiation can pass through dry air but cannot pass through water vapour
and then transmission is altered.
• CT Scan (Computed Tomography)
• It is a medical imaging method employing tomography. This technique is used to
diagnostic studies of internal bodily structures such as tumours.
• X-rays beam are used.
• MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
• It is a medical test used by doctors to diagnose and treat diseases that cannot be
accurately diagnosed by X-rays, ultrasound or CT imaging.
• In MRI, a powerful magnetic field and radio frequency pulses are used.
• TV remote control : It is an electronic device containing an IC(integrated circuit)
and few other components. If a key on a remote control is pressed, it emits infra
red signals.
• Microwave oven : microwaves are used, they are not absorbed by air, glass, paper
etc. and hence do not heat up. Therefore cooking time is reduced.
• Metallic utensils block the microwaves, therefore cannot be used in the microwave
oven.
• Radar : Radio Detection and Ranging to find aeroplanes, ships and missiles etc.
• Maser : Microwave Amplication by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (used to
detect the actual position of artificial satellites, fighter planes, unwanted missiles
etc.
• In Ocean water, masers are utilized to communicated some important messages.
