Peninsular Drainage System
Peninsular Drainage System
• Peninsula rivers are much older than the Himalayan rivers
•
• Most of the major rivers of the peninsula such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the
Krishna and the Cauvery flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These
rivers make deltas at their mouths.
• But the west flowing rivers of Narmada and Tapi as well as those originating from
the Western Ghats and falling in the Arabian Sea form estuaries in place of deltas.
Due to Hard rocks & lack of Distributaries
Peninsular Drainage System
Examples of Falls :
The Jog on the Sharvati (289 m),
Yenna of Mahabaleshwar on Narmada (183 m),
Sivasamundram on the Cauvery(101 m),

Kapildhara (23 m) and
Dhuandar (15 m) on the Narmada
Peninsular River System
• Rivers that drain into Bay of Bengal: The Mahanadi, the Godavari, the

Bay of Bengal.
• Rivers that drain into Arabian Sea: The Narmada, the Tapi, the
Mahi flowing west as well as several small streams originating from the
Western Ghats flow westwards into the Arabian Sea.

EARTH
MOVEMENTS
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Earth Movements : Geomorphic Process
• The formation and deformation of landforms on the surface of the earth are a
continuous process which is due to the continuous influence of external and
internal forces.
• The internal and external forces causing stresses and chemical action on earth
materials and bringing about changes in the configuration of the surface of the
earth are known as geomorphic processes.
• These deformations are caused by the movements generated by various factors
like
1. The heat generated by the radioactive elements in earth’s interior.
2. Movement of the crustal plates due to tectogenesis.
3. Forces generated by rotation of the earth.
4. Climatic factors like winds, precipitation, pressure belts etc.
Earth Movements
Earth Movements – Endogenetic Movements
 Endogenic Forces
• They are those internal forces which derive their strength from the earth’s interior and play a
crucial role in shaping the earth crust.
• Examples – mountain building forces, continent building forces, earthquakes, volcanism etc.
• The endogenic forces are mainly land building forces.
• The earth movements are mainly of two types: diastrophism and the sudden movements.
• The energy emanating from within the earth is the main force behind endogenic geomorphic
processes.
• This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial
heat from the origin of the earth. This energy due to geothermal gradients and heat flow
from within induces diastrophism and volcanism in the lithosphere
Diastrophism (Slow Movements)
• Diastrophism is the general term applied to slow bending, folding,
warping and fracturing.
• Diastrophic forces refer to forces generated by the movement of
the solid material of the earth’s crust. All the processes that move,
elevate or build portions of the earth’s crust come under
diastrophism.
• Diastrophism includes:
• Orogenic processes involving mountain building through severe
folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth’s crust.
• Epeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of
the earth’s crust and it is continental making process.
Diastrophism
• Earthquakes involving local relatively minor
movements.
• Plate tectonics involving horizontal movements of
crustal plates.
• Slow movements/ Diastrophism can again be classified
as vertical movements and horizontal movements
Epeirogenic/Vertical Movements
or continent forming movements
• Vertical movements are mainly associated with
the formation of continents and plateaus. They
are also called as Epeirogenic movements
• The broad central parts of continents are
called cratons and are subject to epeirogeny.
• They do not bring any changes in the
horizontal rock strata.
• These movements are originated from the
centre of the earth.
• Epeirogenic or continent forming movements
act along the radius of the earth; therefore,
they are also called radial movements. Their
direction may be towards
(subsidence) or away (uplift) from the center.
• Examples of Uplifts
are Kathiawar, Nellore, and
Thirunelveli coasts.
• Coringa near the mouth of
the Godavari,
Kaveripattinam in the Kaveri
delta .
• Subsidence : Submerged forests and
valleys as well as buildings are
evidences of subsidence.
• Example are Rann of Kachchh
• Sunderbans
• The Andamans and Nicobars have been
isolated from the Arakan coast by
submergence of the intervening land.
• Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait is very
shallow and has been submerged
• Mahabalipuram near Chennai (Madras)
is submerged in the sea
Orogenic/Horizontal Movements or the
mountain-forming movements
• Horizontal forces acts on the earth’s crust from
side to side to cause these movements.
• They are also known as orogenic movements
(mountain building).
• They bring a lot of disruptions to the horizontal
layer of strata leading to a large structural
deformation of earth’s crust.
• They can be classified as forces of compression
and forces of tension.
• Orogenic or the mountain-forming movements
act tangentially to the earth surface, as in plate
tectonics.
Forces of compression
• Forces of compression are the forces
which push rock strata against a hard
plane from one side or from both sides.
• The compressional forces lead to the
bending of rock layers and thus lead to
the formation of Fold Mountains.
• Most of the great mountain chains of the
world like the Himalayas, the Rockies (N.
America), the Andes (S. America), the Alps
(Europe) etc .
Forces of Tension
• Forces of tension work horizontally, but in opposite directions and
produces fissures
• Under the operation of intense tensional forces, the rock stratum
gets broken or fractured which results in the formation of cracks and
fractures in the crust.
• The displacement of rock upward or downward from their original
position along such a fracture is termed as faulting.
• The line along which displacement of the fractured rock strata take place
is called as the fault line.
• Faulting results in the formation of well-known relief features such
as RiftValleys and Block Mountains. (E.g. Vindhya and Satpura
Mountains)
• A rift valley is formed by sinking of rock strata lying between two almost
parallel faults. (E.g. Valley of Nile, Rift valley of Narmada and Tapti )
• Rift valleys with steep parallel walls along the fault are called
as Graben and the uplifted landmass with steep slopes on both sides are
called as Horst.
• The very steep slope in a continuous line along a fault is termed
as Escarpment.
Sudden Movements
• Earthquake
• Volcanism
• (We have already discussed it in separate
chapters )
Exogenetic Movements
• The forces which derive their strength from the earth’s exterior or
originate within the earth’s atmosphere are called as exogenic forces
or external forces.
• The action of exogenic forces results in wearing down and hence
they are considered as land wearing forces.
• Examples of forces – the wind, waves, water etc.
• Examples of exogenic processes – weathering, mass movement,
erosion, deposition.
• The actions of exogenic forces result in wearing
down (degradation) of relief/elevations and
filling up (aggradation) of basins/ depressions,
on the earth’s surface. The phenomenon of
wearing down of relief variations of the surface
of the earth through erosion is known
as gradation.
• Exogenic (Exogenetic) processes are a direct
result of stress induced in earth materials due
to various forces that come into existence due
to sun’s heat.
• Forces acting along the faces of earth materials
are shear stresses (separating forces). It is this
stress that breaks rocks and other earth
materials.
Exogenic Processes or Denudation
• Denudation means strip off or uncover.
• The elements of nature capable of doing these exogenic
processes are termed as geomorphic agents (or exogenic
geomorphic agents). E.g. the wind, water, waves etc.
• Gravity and gradients are the two things which make these
agents mobile.
• All the movements either within the earth or on the surface of
the earth occur due to gradients– from higher levels to lower
levels, from high pressure to low pressure and derive their
energy from the sun and also the gradient created by tectonic
factors.
• The gravitational force acts upon all earth materials having
sloping surface and tends to produce movement of matter in the
down-slope direction. This creates stress and induces
deformation to the particles.
Denudation
Weathering
• Weathering is the action of elements
of weather and climate over earth material.
• It can be defined mechanical disintegration and
chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions
of various elements of weather and climate.
• When rocks undergo weathering, some minerals are
removed through chemical/ physical leaching by
ground water and thereby the concentration of
remaining (valuable) minerals increase.
• There are three major groups of weathering
processes: (i) chemical; (ii) physical or mechanical;
(iii) biological weathering processes.
Chemical Weathering Processes
• Chemical weathering can be due to
solution, carbonation, hydration
or oxidation/reduction.
• This act on the rocks to
decompose, dissolve or reduce
them to a fine state.
• Water and air (oxygen and carbon
dioxide) along with heat speed up
all chemical reactions.
Chemical Weathering : Solution
• When something is dissolved in water or acids,
the water or acid with dissolved content is called
as a solution.
• This process involves removal of solids in solution
and depends upon the solubility of a mineral in
water or weak acids.
• When coming contact with water, many solids
disintegrate and mix up as a suspension in water.
• Soluble rock forming minerals like nitrates,
sulphates, potassium etc are affected by this
process.
• So, these minerals are easily leached out without
leaving any residue in rainy climates and
accumulate in dry regions.
Carbonation
• Carbonation is the reaction of
carbonate and bicarbonate with
minerals and is common process
helping to break down of feldspar
and carbonate minerals.
• Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and soil air is absorbed by water to
form carbonic acid that acts as a
weak acid.
• Calcium carbonates and magnesium
carbonates are dissolved in carbonic
acid and are removed in a solution
without leaving any residue resulting
in cave formation.
Hydration
• Hydration is the chemical addition of water.
• Minerals take up water and expand; this
expansion causes an increase in the volume
of the material itself or rock.
• The volume changes in minerals due to
hydration will also help in physical
weathering through exfoliation and granular
disintegration.
• E.g. calcium sulphate takes in water and
turns to gypsum, which is more unstable
than calcium sulphate.
Oxidation and Reduction
• In weathering, oxidation means a combination of a mineral with oxygen to
form oxides or hydroxides.
• Minerals most commonly involved in this are iron, manganese, sulphur
etc.
• The red colour of the iron upon oxidation turns to brown and yellow.
• In this process of oxidation, rock breakdown occurs due to the disturbance
caused by the addition of oxygen.
• When oxidized minerals are placed in an environment where oxygen is
absent, reduction takes place.
• Such conditions exist usually below the water table, in areas of stagnant
water and waterlogged ground.
Biological activity and weathering
• Biological weathering is removal of minerals and
ions from the weathering environment and physical
changes due to growth or movement of organisms.
• They also bring conditions for physical or chemical
weathering.
• Grazing of animals, ploughing by human beings etc
are examples of biological weathering.
• Earthworms, rodents etc., help in exposing the new
surfaces to chemical attack and assists in the
penetration of moisture and air.
• Plant roots exert a tremendous pressure on the
earth materials mechanically breaking them apart.
Physical Weathering Processes
• Physical or mechanical weathering
processes depend on some applied
forces like
I. gravitational forces
II. expansion forces due to temperature
changes;
III. water pressures controlled by wetting
and drying cycles.
Causes: Most of the physical weathering
are caused by thermal expansion and
pressure.
Unloading and Expansion
• Removal of overlying rock load because of
continued erosion causes vertical pressure
release.
• Thus, the upper layers of the remaining rock
expand to produce disintegration of rock
masses.
• Fractures will develop roughly parallel to the
ground surface.
• In areas of curved ground surfaces, arched
fractures tend to produce massive sheets
or exfoliated slabs.
• So, unloading and expansion create large,
smooth rounded domes called exfoliation
domes.
TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND EXPANSION:
• With rising in temperature, every
mineral expands and pushes against
its neighbor and as the temperature
falls, a corresponding contraction
takes place.
• Due to differential heating and the
resulting expansion and contraction
of surface layers and their
subsequent exfoliation from the
surface results in smooth rounded
surfaces in rocks called tors.
Freezing, Thawing and Frost Wedging
• Cycles of freezing and thawing (the weather becomes
warmer and causes snow and ice to melt) causes frost
weathering.
• It is most effective at high elevations in mid-latitude where
freezing and melting is often repeated.
• During the warm season, the water penetrates the pore
spaces or fractures in rocks.
• During the cold season, the water freezes into ice and its
volume expands as a result.
• This exerts tremendous pressure on rock walls to tear apart
even where the rocks are massive.
• Frost weathering occurs due to growth of ice within pores
and cracks of rocks during repeated cycles of freezing and
melting.
Salt Weathering
• Salts in rocks expand due to thermal action, hydration and
crystallization.
• High temperature ranges between 30-50 0 C of surface
temperatures favours such salt expansions.
• Salt crystallization is the most effective of all salt weathering
processes.
• It is favoured in areas of alternative wetting and drying
conditions.
• Salt crystals in near-surface pores cause splitting of
individual grains within rocks, which eventually fall off
which may result in granular disintegration or granular
foliation.
Mass Movements
• These movements transfer the mass of
rock debris down the slope under
the direct influence of gravity.
• Mass movements are very active over
weathered slopes rather than over
unweathered slopes.
• Usual geographic agents like running
water, glaciers, wind, waves etc do not
have much role to play in mass
movements, and it is the gravity, which is
the main driving force.
• Mass movements are classified into slow
movements and rapid movements.
Slow movements
• A) CREEP:
• It occurs on moderate steep, soilcovered slopes .
• Some of the electric posts in our
region which are posted in sloppy
areas deviated from their horizontal
linearity. This is an effect of creep.
• B) SOLIFLUCTION:
• It is the process of slow down
slope flowing of soil mass or finegrained rock debris saturated
or lubricated with water.
• It can be said as a type of creep
with lubricated water influences
the movement.
• It mainly occurs in permafrost
regions as the layers of ground
water are occupied in between
permanently frozen soil and rocks.
Rapid movements
• A) EARTHFLOW:
• Movement of watersaturated clayey or
silty earth materials
down low angle
terraces or hillsides is
called earthflow
• B) MUDFLOW:
• In the absence of vegetation
and cover and with heavy
rainfall, thick layers of
weathered materials get
saturated with water and
either slow or rapidly flow
down along definite channels
is called as mudflow.
• C)DEBRIS AVALANCHE:
• It is more in humid
regions with or without
vegetation.
• It occurs in narrow tracks
on sleep slopes and is
similar to snow avalanche.
• D) LANDSLIDES:
• In landslides, the materials involved are
relatively dry irrespective of the above
said rapid mass movements. Landslides
can be classified into slump, debris slide,
rock slide etc
• Slump: It is a type of landslide in which
slipping of several units of rock debris
occurs with a backward rotation with
respect to the slope over which the
movement takes place.
• Debris slide: In this type of landslide,
there is no backward rotation. The fall is
almost vertical.
• Rock slide: It is nothing but the slide of
individual rock masses.
Erosion and Deposition
• Erosion is the acquisition and
transportation of rock debris by
geomorphic agents like running
water, the wind, waves etc.
• Deposition is a consequence of
erosion.
• The erosional agents loose their
velocity and energy on gentle
slopes and materials carried by
them start to settle themselves.
Significance of weathering
• Weathering is the first step in formation of soils.
• Weathering of rocks and deposits helps in the enrichment and
concentrations of certain valuable ores of iron, manganese,
aluminium, copper etc.
• Weathering helps in soil enrichment.
• Without weathering, the concentration of the same valuable
material may not be sufficient and economically viable to exploit,
process and refine. This is what is called enrichment.

Characteristics and
Geological Time Scale
Part - 1
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Geographical Division
• Earth: Blue planet
• Average distance from sun : 149 million km
• Perihelion : Nearest position of earth from sun. The earth
reaches its perihelion on Jan 3 every year at a distance of
about 147 million km
• Aphelion : Farthest position of earth from sun. The earth
reaches its aphelion on July 4 every year at a distance of
about 152 million km
Relation to Solar System
Shape of Earth
• Oblate spheroid or
oblate ellipsoid shape
• Slightly flattering at
poles & slightly bulging
at equator
• Polar radius approx. 21
km shorter than
equatorial radius
Axis of Earth
Earth rotating around an imaginary line running
through North pole & South pole via its center
Equator
 Center most parallel, dividing earth into two
equal hemispheres namely Northern & Southern
hemisphere
 Lying at 0* latitude
Tropic of Cancer Parallels at 23.5* north of equator
Tropic of
Capricorn Parallels at 23.5* south of equator
Arctic Circle Parallels at 66.5* north of Equator
Antarctic circle Parallels at 66.5* south of Equator
Latitudes
 Angular distance of a place, along meridian on earth’s surface as
measured from center
 Distance between them increases towards the poles
Longitudes
 Imaginary lines which joins poles & perpendicular to all parallels
 Drawn as a semicircle on the globe
 Also known as meridians

Distinct Features
• Length of latitudes decreases from equator to poles i.e. max. at equator &
0 at poles
• As earth’s axis is inclined by 23.5* to its orbital plane, therefore 23.5* is
max. latitude upto which sunrays can be perpendicular to any place
• Means all places between Tropic of cancer & Tropic of Capricorn
experience vertical rays of sun twice a year but both the tropics only once
• Tropic of cancer will get vertical sunrays at summer solstice, when
Northern hemisphere of earth is at max. inclination from sunrays
• Tropic of Capricorn will get vertical sunrays at winter solstice, when
southern hemisphere of earth is at max. inclination from sunrays
Earth Movements
2 types :
• Rotation of daily
movements
• Revolution of
annual movements
Rotation of Earth
• Earth’s rotate around its own axis from
west to east viz. anticlockwise direction
• Earth’s rotate around the sun (Elliptical
path) from west to east viz.
anticlockwise direction
• Axis of earth rotation is inclined at 23.5*
to perpendicular to the plane of elliptic
• Plane of earths equator to plane of
elliptic or earth’s axis to axis of
revolution is inclined at 23.5*
Rotation of Earth
• Velocity of earth’s rotation decreases from equator to poles
• Correlated with length of the parallels which also decreases from
equator to poles
• Weight of body is less at equator & greater at poles
• Because of greater centrifugal force at the equator (mv^2 / r) due
to greater velocity at equator
• Because of higher gravitational force at poles (GMm/r) due to lesser
radius of poles than the equator
Rotation of Earth
• The earth moves in space in two distinct ways viz.
• It rotates on its own axis from west to east once in
every 24 hours causing day & night
• Time Period : 23 hrs 56 min 4 sec
• Earths Rotation results in
a) Causation of days and nights
b) a difference of one hour between two meridians
which are 15 degree apart.
c) Change in the direction of wind and ocean
currents
Revolution of Earth
• It is earth’s motion in elliptical orbit around the sun.
• It revolves around the sun in an orbit every 365(1/4) days causing
the seasons & the year and results in one extra day every 4
th year.
• Revolution of earth results in
a) Change of seasons
b) Variation in the length of days and nights at different times of the
year.
c) Shifting of wind belts
d) Determination of latitudes
Revolution of Earth
Revolution of Earth
• Throughout the revolution of earth around the sun,
its axis remains tilted in the same direction
• Its axis continues to point to same spot in heaven
known as Polaris / polestar/ parallelism of axis
• Polestar i.e.Brightest star in the sky in north direction
or northern star
Seasons
• They are the periods into which the year can be
divided as a result of climatic conditions, largely due to
change in the duration and intensity of solar
radiations. The 4 seasons are
1. Spring in Northern Hemisphere: It occurs when on
March 21, the sun is directly overhead at equator .
2. Summer in NH: It occurs when on March 21, the sun
is directly overhead at Tropic of Cancer .
3. Autumn in Northern Hemisphere: It occurs when on
September 23, the sun is directly overhead at equator
again .
4. Winter in NH: It occurs when on Dec 22, the sun is
directly overhead at Tropic of Capricorn
Facts
• Sidereal Day: It is the time taken by the Earth to
rotate about its axis so that the distant stars
appear in the same position in the sky. Sidereal
day is of 23 hr 56 min.
• Solar day: It is the time taken for the Earth to
rotate about its axis so that the Sun appears in
the same position in the sky. Solar day is of 24
hrs.
• This difference is the reason why different
constellations are only visible at specific time of
the year.
Equinoxes
• The sun is vertically overhead at the
equator on two days of the year usually
on 21 March & 21 September
• Dates changes because a year is not
exactly of 365 days
• These two days are termed as equinox
means on these two days all parts of the
world have equal days & nights
Seasonal Changes
• In summer, sun is overhead & its sunrays fall almost vertically on
the earth, concentrating its heat on a small area;
• Temperature therefore rises & summers are always warm
• In winters, the oblique rays of sun come through atmosphere less
directly & have their heat absorbed by atmosphere & water vapour;
• Sun rays fall obliquely & spread over greater area, hence
temperature remain low.
Seasonal Changes
• In addition days are longer than nights in summer &
more heat is received over longer daylight duration;
Nights are shorter & less heat is lost.
• Hence, there is net gain in total heat received &
temperature rises in summer. Shorter days & longer
nights in winters accounts for reverse effect.
Solstices
• When sun is at the greatest distance from the
equator
• Its rays falls vertical either at tropic of Cancer
or tropic of Capricorn
Summer Solstice
• Earth’s axis leans at max 23.5* in
northern hemisphere towards the sun
• Sun’s ray fall vertical at Tropic of cancer
around 21/22 June
• This brings summer season in Northern
hemisphere
• With this duration of days starts
decreasing
• Means June 21/June 22 is longest day in
Northern hemisphere
Summer Solstice
• Daylights of 14 hrs at Tropic of Cancer; 12 hrs at Equator; 10
hrs at Tropic of Capricorn
• Between Arctic Circle & North Pole day lasts for 24 hours &
between Antarctic Circle & South Pole same duration of night
lasts.
• At North Pole day last for 6 months & at South Pole night last
for 6 month approx.
Winter Solstice
• Earth’s axis leans at max 23.5* in
southern hemisphere towards the sun
• Sun’s ray falls vertical at Tropic of
Capricorn around 21/22 Dec.
• This brings summer season in Southern
hemisphere
• With this duration of days starts
increasing in Northern hemisphere
• Means Dec 21/June 22 is shortest day in
Northern hemisphere
Winter Solstice
• Daylights of 14 hrs at Tropic of Capricorn; 12 hrs at Equator;
10 hrs at Tropic of Cancer
• Between Antarctic Circle & South Pole day lasts for 24 hours &
between Arctic Circle & North Pole same duration of night
lasts.
• At South Pole day last for 6 months & at North Pole night last
for 6 month approx.

Midnight sun
• The midnight sun phenomena,
also known as the polar day,
where the sun is fully visible day
and night.
• During this time, the sun
remains visible at local midnight.
• Midnight sun can last for days to
several months, where days and
nights are alike.
Midnight sun
• It is the phenomenon in the latitudes
66.5 degree North and South for Arctic
and Antarctic Circles where the sun does
not sink below the horizon during
summer.
• This results due to the tilt of the earth’s
axis, each hemisphere is inclined towards
the sun during summer.
• The duration of the phenomenon
increases towards the poles, where it
may be observed for 6 months of each
year.
Midnight sun
• The poles experiences about 6 months of day and 6 months of night
because of tilt of axis of the earth. Because of the tilt of the axis,
each pole is tilted away from the sun for about 6 months each.
• When the north pole is tilted towards the Sun, it continuous
experience daylight for 6 months. It is the night for the same time
period at the south pole. These conditions are reversed when the
South pole is tilted towards the sun.
• North pole experiences day from 21st March to 23rd September.
• South Pole experiences day from 23rd September to 21st March
Dawn & Twilight
• The brief period between sunrise
& full daylight is called dawn &
that between sunset & complete
darkness is termed as twilight.
• This is caused by the fact that
during the periods of dawn &
twilight earth receives diffused or
refracted light from the sun while
it is still below the horizon, but its
rays are scattered by the Earth’s
Atmosphere to create the colors
of twilight.
Dawn & Twilight
• Since the sun rises & sets in vertical path
at the equator, the period during which
refracted light is received is short.
• But in temperate latitudes, the rises &
sets in oblique path & hence the period
of refracted light is longer than that at
equator, which is much longer at poles.
• We have Twilight because Earth has
atmosphere. Some light scatters through
small particles in the atmosphere- so
there is some light in the sky even the
sun has gone down.
Latitudes
• Latitude is the angle between the equatorial
plane and the axis. Lines joining points of the
same latitude are called parallels.
• Equator {0° parallel} itself is largest parallel
and only circle of latitude which also is a great
circle.
• Equator is also used as fundamental plane of
all geographic coordinate systems.
• Geostationary satellites are over the equator
at a specific point on Earth, so their position
related to Earth is expressed in longitude
degrees only. Their latitude is always zero.
Latitudes
• There are 181 latitudes and each degree
of latitude spans around 111 kilometers
or 69 miles or 60 Nautical miles.
• But this distance varies because Earth is
not a perfect sphere.
• From Equator to 40° towards both poles
it is slightly less than 111 kilometers and
from 41° towards both poles it is slightly
more than 111 kilometers.
Longitudes
• It is the angular distance measured from the centre of the
earth.
• Longitude is the angle east or west of a reference meridian
between the two geographical poles to another meridian that
passes through an arbitrary point.
• All meridians are halves of great circles, and are not parallel to
each other. They converge only at the north and south poles.
• A line passing to the rear of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich
(near London in the UK) has been chosen as the international
zero-longitude reference line and is known as the Prime
Meridian.
Longitudes
• Places to the east are in the eastern
hemisphere, and places to the west are in the
western hemisphere. The antipodal meridian of
Greenwich serves as both 180°W and 180°E.
• There are 360 meridians and the longitude of
prime meridian is 0°. Length of all meridians is
equal.
• The distance between two meridians is farthest
at the equator and it decreases as we move
towards poles and becomes zero at poles.
HEAT ZONES OF THE EARTH
• Torrid Zone
• The mid-day sun is exactly overhead at least once a year on all
latitudes in between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of
Capricorn. It therefore, receives the maximum heat.
• Temperate Zones
• The mid-day sun never shines overhead on any latitude beyond the
Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The angle of the sun’s
rays goes on decreasing towards the poles. and the Tropic of
Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle in the Southern Hemisphere, They
have moderate temperatures
• Frigid Zones
• Areas lying between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole in the
Northern Hemisphere and the Antarctic Circle and the South Pole in
the Southern Hemisphere, are very cold. It is because here the sun
does not rise much above the horizon.
Greenwich Meridian
• Also known as Prime
Meridian or Time Meridian
• Meridian passing through
Royal observatory at
Greenwich
near London which divides
earth in eastern & western
hemisphere
 Prime Meridian passes through following
countries :-
 1- United Kingdom( Greenwich, London)
 2- France 3- Spain 4- Algeria
 5- Mali 6- Burkena Faso 7- Togo
 8- Ghana
• Apart from countries, through what other places
Prime Meridian Passes?
 1- Arctic Ocean 2- Norwegian Sea
 3- Greenland Sea 4- Mediterranean Sea
 5- Atlantic Ocean 6- Southern Ocean
 7- Antarctica
International Date Line
• Exact opposite to Greenwich
meridian at longitude of 180*
• It is International Date Line which
is drawn at 180 degree
longitude to determine the date
which is passed through the Arctic
Oceans, Bering Strait, Pacific
Ocean, Antarctica, Fiji, Tonga and
other islands.
• If we see this imaginary line, then
we found, it is not straight but zigzag line.
• But, if it is a straight line, then
it demarcates the same land mass into
two parts and then both places have
different dates on the same day. It
would be very inconvenient if one part
of a country had one date of the
week while another part would have
the different date.
International Date Line marks the place
where each day officially begins. At the
international date line, the west side of
the line has been always one day ahead
of the East side, no matter what time of
day it is when the line crossed.
Longitude & Concept of time
• Earth completes 1 rotation in 24 hours means swept 360* in 24
hours i.e. 15 * in one hour or 1* in 4 minute
• Since earth rotates west to east places located in the east gain time
while those located in the west loose time
Longitude & Concept of time
• Generally, 12:00 noon at a place is considered when sun’s
altitude is highest & exactly over the meridian at that place
• Time at all the places located at particular meridian i.e. north
& south will be same, however places located at east & west
will have different local time
Standard time of a country
• Standard time of a country is local time of a selected longitude
crossing through a place in the country of due importance i.e.
particular meridian is chosen for the whole country whose time is
known as ‘ Standard Time’.
• The world is thus divided into a number of time zones. Larger
countries like Russia, Canada, USA have east-west extension so that
they have adopt the several time zones.
• For example : Russia has 11 time zones, USA has 9 time zones and
Australia has 3 time zones.
Standard time of a country
• India, Whose longitudinal extent is
approx. 30 degree has adopted one time
zone, means longitude passing through
Allahabad situated at 82.5* East of
Prime meridian i.e. Five & half hours
ahead of GMT
• The Standard Meridian passes through 5
states :
• Uttar Pradesh Madhya Pradesh
• Chhattisgarh Odisha
• Andhra Pradesh

• Graticule
 Network of parallels & meridians
drawn on the globe
 Helps to locate a place with given
longitudes & latitudes
• Great Circles
 Imaginary circles which divides the
earth into two equal parts & whose
center lies at the center of the earth
 Largest circles that can be drawn on
the globe i.e. Equator & all meridians

Characteristics and
Geological Time Scale
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Eclipses
• Partial or total obstruction of
light from a celestial body as it
passes through shadow of
another celestial body
• Apparently, eclipse shall occur
every month because of
revolution of earth around the
sun & moon around the earth
Lunar Eclipse
• When earth comes exactly between Sun &
moon
• Usually occurs at full moon
• However it does not occur on every full
moon day because the moon is so small
and the plane of its orbit is tilted about 5
degree with respect to the plane of the
earth’s orbit.
• It is the reason why eclipses do not occur
every month.
Lunar Eclipse
• A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth
passes between the Sun and the Moon
in such a way that the Moon moves into
Earth’s shadow.
• When a partial lunar eclipse is going on,
the curved shadow of Earth is apparent
on the Moon’s face; the Moon looks
kind of like it is in a crescent phase.
Lunar Eclipse
• When a total lunar eclipse is happening, the entire Moon is in
Earth’s shadow, and the Moon looks full, but glows only faintly
red.
• The reason is as follows: Earth’s atmosphere is dense enough to
act a little bit like a lens, so it refracts a small amount of sunlight
shining through it toward the Moon.
• This small fraction of light, which is mostly red because that is
the color of light that refracts best, bounces off the Moon’s
surface and comes back to Earth.
• During totality, however, the Earth-atmosphere-refracted light is
quite visible as a soft reddish glow.
lunar eclipse
How a total lunar eclipse works
During a total lunar eclipse, though the Moon
gets shadowed by the Earth, sunlight passing
through the Earth’s atmosphere, break down
in its constituent colours and the red part gets
scattered by the atmosphere and falls on the
Moon’s surface, thereby making it take on a
reddish copper hue.
For this reason since antiquity, a totally
eclipsed Moon is called a “Blood Moon”. It has
no other special relevance other than the fact
that the colour of the Moon looks blackish-red
Blue Moon
• The Moon does not turn blue but
historically the second full Moon of
an English calendar month is
termed as a Blue Moon.
• Term "blue moon" is used when
the full moon appears twice in less
than 28 days because moon takes
approximately 27 days to orbit the
earth. Therefore, we can say that
blue moon happens on an average
every three years.
Super Moon
• The coming lunar eclipse
will be more spectacular
because during the
eclipse, the Moon will be
near its perigee and
hence it will look larger
than an average full
Moon, and is termed a
Super Moon.
Solar Eclipse
• When moon comes exactly between
earth & sun & obstructs a part or
whole of the sun then a partial or
total eclipse occur
• Usually at sunrise or sunset at new
moon when the moon is in line with
the sun,
• However due to inclination of the
moon’s orbit, a solar eclipse doesn’t
occur on every moon day.
Solar Eclipse
• Like Earth’s shadow, the Moon’s shadow consists
of two parts: a dark, central region called the
umbra, and a lighter region called the penumbra
that surrounds the umbra. Under the penumbra,
a partial solar eclipse occurs. Under the umbra, a
total eclipse or an annular eclipse is seen.
• Since the Moon travels in a slightly elliptical orbit
around Earth, rather than in a perfectly circular
path, its distance from Earth is not always the
same.
• If the Moon’s umbra falls on Earth’s surface when
the two bodies are at a closer point in the Moon’s
orbit, there is total solar eclipse.
Solar Eclipse
• But if the Moon happens to be too far away from Earth
at that time, the Moon does not cover enough of the
sky to block the Sun’s rays entirely. In that case, the Sun
is seen as a ring, or annulus, of light glowing around
the silhouette of the Moon.
• During totality of a solar eclipse, the Sun looks like a
perfectly black disk surrounded by glowing light. This
light is actually the Sun’s corona, which is invisible
under normal circumstances because the Sun is so
bright. Away from the corona, the sky is dark, so
planets and stars that ordinarily could be seen only at
night become visible.
Why Moon blocks Sun so perfectly
during solar eclipse?
• The Moon’s diameter is just under 400 times smaller than the
diameter of the Sun. Coincidentally, the Moon’s distance from
Earth is also just under 400 times smaller than the Sun’s
distance from Earth. That is why the Moon covers almost
exactly the same amount of sky, when viewed from Earth’s
surface, as the Sun. We are able to see only Corona during
Total solar eclipse.
Tides
Movement of Oceanic Water → Never Static
Vertical Movement is called Tides
Horizontal Movement is called Ocean waves & Ocean currents
Tides
• Periodic rise & fall in level of water in the oceans mainly caused by
gravitational pull of sun & moon.
• Due to the large size of sun it should attract more but because of its
greater distance from the earth, it is unable to exert much
influential gravitational force.
• Whereas, moon is much smaller than the sun but attracts more due
to its lesser distance from the earth.
• Hence, it produces a force approx. 2.17 times stronger than the sun.
Tides
• Centrifugal force caused by earth’s rotation is another major
cause of tides formation.
• Together the gravitational pull & centrifugal forces are
responsible for creating two major tidal bulges on earth.
• On side facing the moon, tidal bulge occurs due to
gravitational pull of the moon whereas on opposite side, tidal
bulge occurs due to centrifugal force of rotation of the earth.
Tides
Factors Controlling the Nature and
Magnitude of Tides
• The movement of the moon in relation to the earth.
• Changes in position of the sun and moon in relation to the
earth.
• Uneven distribution of water over the globe.
• Irregularities in the configuration of the oceans.
• On the surface of the earth, the horizontal tide generating
forces are more important than the vertical forces in
generating the tidal bulges.
Factors Controlling the Nature and
Magnitude of Tides
• The tidal bulges on wide continental shelves, have greater height. When
tidal bulges hit the mid-oceanic islands they become low.
• Continental shelves are close to the landmass and are often accompanied
with enclosed basins. This limits the cross-sectional area of water. As the
moon passes over a shelf or basin, it pulls an equivalent volume of water
from open ocean into the basin.
• Since the cross-sectional area of water in the basin is lower than the open
ocean, the tidal bulge has a larger height.
• The shape of bays and estuaries along a
coastline can also magnify the intensity
of tides.
• Funnel-shaped bays greatly change tidal
magnitudes.
• The highest tides in the world occur in
the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia,
Canada. The tidal bulge is 15 – 16 m.
• When the tide is channeled between
islands or into bays and estuaries they
are called tidal currents (tidal bore is
one such tidal current).
• There are two high tides and two low
tides every day (slightly more than a 24
hour period); then a tide must come in
within about a six hour period.
Tides based on Frequency
• Semi-diurnal tide
 The most common tidal pattern,
featuring two high tides and two low
tides each day [Actually it varies
between 3 tides to 4 tides –– 3 tides
in rare cases but 4 is normal]. The
successive high or low tides are
approximately of the same height.
Semi-diurnal tide
• Because the moon revolves around
the earth from west to east,
and each day it moves a bit to the
east if observed from the same
place on earth at the same time on
two consecutive days.
• This is why the tide interval of 12
hours and- 25 minutes between two
tides, as tides occur twice a day.
Tides based on Frequency
• Diurnal tide
 There is only one high tide and one low tide
during each day. The successive high and
low tides are approximately of the same
height.
• Mixed tide
 Tides having variations in height are known
as mixed tides. These tides generally occur
along the west coast of North America and
on many islands of the Pacific Ocean.

Tides based on the Sun, Moon and
the Earth Positions
The height of rising water (high tide) varies
appreciably depending upon the position of sun and
moon with respect to the earth. Spring
tides and neap tides come under this category.
Spring Tides
• When the sun, moon and the earth are in the straight line,
the gravitional force is at greatest because tide producing
force of both sun and moon complement each other and
they pull together.
• This produces tides of unusually range, called the spring
tides.
• On full moon & new moon, moon & sun are almost in line
with the earth
• Hence exerts combine pull on the earth
• On these 2 days tides are highest & called Spring tides.
• These occur about twice a month, at new moon when the
sun and moon are in conjugation and at the full when they
are in opposition.
Neap Tides
• Lowest magnitude as the tide producing forces of the sun
and moon act opposite to each other, as they form a
triangle.
• This happens during phases of the first and third quarter
i.e. at half moon, the sun’s tide producing force tends to
balance the tide producing force of the moon, resulting in
tides of unusually small range known as Neap tides.
• When moon is in the 1
st quarter or last quarter, sun &
moon makes right angle to each other, with earth as
center
• Hence attraction of sun & moon balances each other,
which results in low amplitude tides known as Neap tides
Neap Tides
• Normally, there is a seven day interval between the spring tides
and neap tides.
• At this time the sun and moon are at right angles to each other
and the forces of the sun and moon tend to counteract one
another.
• The Moon’s attraction, though more than twice as strong as the
sun’s, is diminished by the counteracting force of the sun’s
gravitational pull.
• Like spring tides, these tides also occur twice a month.
Magnitude of tides based on Perigee
and apogee of moon
• Once in a month, when the moon’s
orbit is closest to the earth (perigee),
unusually high and low tides occur.
During this time the tidal range is
greater than normal.
• Two weeks later, when the moon is
farthest from earth (apogee), the
moon’s gravitational force is limited
and the tidal ranges are less than their
average heights.
Magnitude of tides based on
Perihelion and Aphelion of earth
• When the earth is closest to the
sun (perihelion), around 3rd
January each year, tidal ranges are
also much greater, with unusually
high and unusually low tides.
• When the earth is farthest from the
sun (aphelion), around 4th July each
year, tidal ranges are much less than
average.
Ebb and Flood
• The time between the high
tide and low tide, when the
water level is falling, is called
the ebb.
• The time between the low
tide and high tide, when the
tide is rising, is called
the flow or flood.
Importance of Tides
Since tides are caused by the earth-moon-sun
positions which are known accurately, the tides can
be predicted well in advance. This helps the
navigators and fishermen plan their activities.
Navigation
• High tides help in navigation. They raise the water level close
to the shores. This helps the ships to arrive at the harbour
more easily.
• Tides generally help in making some of the rivers navigable for
ocean-going vessels.
Importance of Tides
• Fishing
 The high tides also help in fishing. Many more fish come
closer to the shore during the high tide. This enables
fishermen to get a plentiful catch.
• Desilting
 Tides are also helpful in desilting the sediments and in
removing polluted water from river estuaries.
 Tides are used to generate electrical power
Tidal bore
• Tides also occur in gulfs. The gulfs with wide
fronts and narrow rears experience higher
tides.
• The in and out movement of water into a
gulf through a channels called a tidal
current.
• When a tide enters the narrow and shallow
estuary of a river, the front of the tidal wave
appears to be vertical owing to the piling up
of water of the river against the tidal wave
and the friction of the river bed.
Tidal bore
• The steep-nosed tide crest looks like a
vertical wall of-water rushing upstream
and is known as a tidal bore.
• A tidal bore takes place during the flood
tide and never during the ebb tide (Tidal
bores almost never occur during neap
tides. Neap tides happen during quarter
moons, when tides are weakest).
Impact of Tidal Bore
• Tides are stable and can be predicted.
Tidal bores are less predictable and
hence can be dangerous.
• The tidal bores adversely affect the
shipping and navigation in the estuarine
zone.
• Strong tidal bores disrupt fishing zones
in estuaries and gulfs.
Impact of Tidal Bore
• Tidal bores have an adverse impact on the
ecology of the river mouth. The tidal-bore
affected estuaries are the rich feeding
zones and breeding grounds of several
forms of wildlife.
• Animals slammed by the leading edge of a
tidal wave can be buried in the silty water.
For this reason, carnivores and scavengers
are common sights behind tidal bores.

Economic Exploitation Of India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• The Britishers arrived in India in 1600s, but there real
interference in the Indian polity and economy started in 1757.
• The economic policies and its effects on the economy of India
during the British Raj can be grouped into three phases.
Introduction
1. The first phases were characterised by mercantilism which started
after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and continued till 1813.

 This phase was marked by the drain of wealth from India and direct
colonial plunder by the East India Company through monopoly in
trade and its other policies. It was the beginning of colonial
exploitation of the economy of India.
Introduction
2. The second phases were characterised by free industrial
capitalism which started in 1813 and continued till 1858.

 The period saw the deindustrialisation and ruralization of India
and the commercialisation of Indian agriculture.
 It converted the economy of India into a market for British
goods and a supplier of raw materials.
Introduction
3. The third phases were the period of financial
capitalism.
 It started from the closing years of 19th century and
continued till independence.
 This face saw finance imperialism through managing
agency forms, Export-Import firms, exchange banks
etc.
• The Battle of Plassey was fought in 1757 and Battle of Buxar
in 1764. The economic loot started from 1757 ended only in
1947 when India was free.
• Industrial Revolution in England started and this brought the
age of spinning genny, power looms and steam engine. The
most important initial developments were as follows:
Textile
• Richard Arkwright developed water frame.
• James Hargreaves developed Spinning Jenny
• Samuel Crompton developed Spinning Mule
• These were developed in the initial decades of the 18th
century. The last of above three i.e. Spinning Mule was
patented in 1769, but the patent ended in 1783. As soon as
this patent ended there was a rapid growth of cotton mills in
England.
Steam Power
• In 1775 James watt patented the improved Steam Engine
which was apart from pumping out machines; it was used in
the power machines.
• This enabled the development of the semi automated
factories.
Iron Industry
• In Iron making, Coke was finally applied to all stages of Iron smelting,
replacing the Charcoal. It improved the production as well as efficiency.
• But, the economic loot in India provided the profits to the Great Britain in
these years that no other investment had ever provided. For almost half a
century, England was standing without a competitor.
Other Industries
• Great Britain kept on maturing the manufacturing and industrial
revolution and in India; it kept changing the objectives and methods of
control towards a more centralized colony.
• The first state of economic loot from India started when East India
Company was given a status of Monopoly Company.
• So far, the company carried Indian goods such as Silk, Saltpeter, Muslin,
spices to the European markets.
Other Industries
• Till its charter was renewed for second time in 1813 and its monopoly was
ended, it kept working on the basis of the 17th century using the power of
the gun and politics.
• The cost of production had nothing to do with the prices fixed by the
company in European Markets.
• The political advancements from 1757 till 1813 gave the company squeeze
out enormous wealth from Indian Rajas, Nawabs and Nizams.
• The Charter Act of 1813 closed the British Markets for Industrial Goods
produced in India. But this act allowed one way duty free trade for the
British Mercantile Capitalists, who made India a dumping ground for
cheap and machine made imports.
Other Industries
• The Indian Industries such as silk and textiles collapsed. The new
manufacturing methods replaced the old manufacturing methods in ship
building, metal works, glass works, paper and many other crafts.
• After losing the industries, Indians were confined with the only industry–
that was agriculture.
• But the agrarian economy also produced raw materials for England’s
machines.
• Destruction of Industries rendered large scale unemployment. People
started running from the Industrial hubs to villages to become cultivators,
the pressure on land increased.
Reasons Responsible for Mercantilism
• The permanent settlement act brought by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 was
responsible for the drain of land revenue from India to Britain.
• This caused hardships and exploitation of the rural economy of India.
• The other Indian powers were unable to regulate and control the
advancements of East India company in India.
• This gave the Britishers freehand to plunder in India during this period of
mercantilism.
Reasons for Deindustrialisation and
Ruralisation of India in This Phase
• The British industrialists needed a market for their products,
so they converted India into a market for Manchester goods
and a supplier of raw materials.
• Very high import duties were levied on Indian exports to
Britain, which was necessary to make Britain the workshop of
the world .
Reasons Responsible for
Commercialization of Agriculture in India
• The demand for raw materials from the British industries such as
Lancashire cotton manufacturers etc. The colonial government supported
the commercialization of agriculture in India.
• It was necessary for the profits of British capitalists and the industrial
development of Britain.
Impacts of Finance Capitalism on India
• Higher taxation for the Indian taxpayers. The plundered wealth was
reinvested which further exploited the Indian economy.
• Around 97% of British capital Investments in India before first world war
was in the administration, plantation, transport, and finance. The main
motive was commercial penetration of India and its exploitation.
• Finance capitalism and other policies of British did not allow the rise of
modern Industries as had happened in other European countries
Development of Modern Industry in India
• Initially, the British exports to India did not allow the rise of modern
machine based industries in India. It was only in the latter half of 19th
century they began to start in India.
• The first cotton textile mill began in Bombay in 1853, which was set up by
Cowasjee Nanabhoy Daver.
• The first Jute mill was set up in Rishra (Bengal) in 1855.
• The Indian owned Industries like jute and cotton textiles were established
in the second half of 19th century, while the iron and steel, cement, sugar
etc. came in the 20th century.
Development of Modern Industry in India
• There was a lack of sufficient technical manpower in India due to the
neglect of technical education in India which retarded the healthy growth
of Indian Industries.
• The Indian owned Industries had to face unequal competition from the
foreign companies and strong opposition from the foreign capitalist
interests.
• Also, there were regional disparities in the industrial development which
hampered the nation-building process.

El Nino and La Nina
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• Monsoon is a familiar though a little known climatic phenomenon. In India, from agriculture to
economic policies to disaster management, a lot depends on the Monsoon.
• The Monsoon is a recurring event i.e. it repeats after a certain frequency of time – a year in our
case. But, it may not be uniform in every period (year). There are a lot of factors which affect
its duration and intensity over India.
• The Monsoon is basically a result of the flow of moisture laden winds because of the variation
of temperature across the Indian Ocean.
• There are a number of climatic phenomena which affect it namely the Indian ocean dipole, El
nino, La nina, Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO) etc. These phenomena affect the
temperature distribution over the oceans and thus affecting the direction and intensity of flow
of the moisture laden winds.
Origin
• El Nino and La Nina are opposite phases of what is
known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle.
• The ENSO cycle is a scientific term that describes the
fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and
atmosphere in the east-central
Equatorial Pacific. (The area between South America
and Australia near the equator )
• La Nina is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of
ENSO and El Nino as the warm phase of ENSO.
• These deviations from normal surface temperatures can
have large-scale impacts not only on ocean processes,
but also on global weather and climate, including India.
• For a normal monsoon season, the pressure distribution
is as such:
• In a normal monsoon year (without El Nino), the pressure
distribution is as follows:
• The coast of Peru in South America has a higher pressure
than the region near northern Australia and South East
Asia.
• The Indian Ocean is warmer than the adjoining oceans
and so, has relatively lower pressure. Hence, moistureladen winds move from near the western Pacific to the
Indian Ocean.
• The pressure on the landmass of India is lower than on
the Indian Ocean, and so, the moisture-laden winds move
further from the ocean to the lands.
• If this normal pressure distribution is affected for some
reason, the monsoons are affected.
El Nino
• El Nino means ‘little boy’ or ‘Christ child’ in Spanish.
• The cool surface water off the Peruvian coast goes
warm because of El Nino.
• When the water is warm, the normal trade winds get
lost or reverse their direction.
• Hence, the flow of moisture-laden winds is directed
towards the coast of Peru from the western Pacific
(the region near northern Australia and South East
Asia).
• This causes heavy rains in Peru during the El Nino
years robbing the Indian subcontinent of its normal
monsoon rains.
• The larger the temperature and pressure difference,
the larger the rainfall shortage in India.
El Nino Effects
• El Nino results in the rise of sea surface temperatures.
• It also weakens the trade winds of the affected region
• In India, Australia, it can bring about drought conditions. This affects the
crop productivity largely.
• It has been also observed certain times, that EL Nino may not bring
drought but cause heavy rainfall.
• In both the cases, it causes heavy damage.
La Nina
• La Nina means ‘little girl’ in Spanish and is also known
as El Viejo or ‘cold event’.
• Here, the water temperature in the Eastern Pacific gets
colder than normal.
• As a result of this, there is a strong high pressure over
the eastern equatorial Pacific.
• Now, there is low pressure in the Western Pacific and
off Asia.
• La Nina causes drought in Peru and Ecuador, heavy
floods in Australia, high temperatures in Western
Pacific, Indian Ocean, off the Somalian coast and good
monsoon rains in India.
• A La Nina is actually beneficial for the Indian monsoon.
• Generally, El Nino and La Nina occur every 4 – 5 years.
El Nino is more frequent than La Nina.
ENSO
• It is called El Nino Southern Oscillation.
• In normal times, when the tropical south Pacific ocean experiences high pressure,
alternatively the tropical Indian ocean experiences low pressure conditions.
• However, these pressure conditions are sometimes reversed, and results in low
pressure in the Pacific and alternatively high pressure in the Indian ocean.
• This is the periodic change in pressure conditions which is referred to as the
Southern Oscillation.
• These changes in the pressure conditions being developed in the Pacific and Indian
oceans are connected with the phenomenon of El Nino.
• This connected phenomenon is referred to as the El Nino Southern Oscillations or
the ENSO.

statesmen are laying the foundations of a Federal Constitution for that land,
we address this appeal to you, in the name of our common heritage, on
behalf of our thirty million Muslim brethren who live in PAKSTAN – by
which we mean the five Northern units of India,
 Viz: Punjab, North-West Frontier Province (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sind
and Baluchistan. ”

Pirpur Committee

 Was established in November 1938 by the All India Muslim League
 to prepare a detailed report regarding the atrocities of the Congress
Ministries (1937-1939) in different provinces.
 Its report charged the congress for interference with the religious rites,
suppression of Urdu and propaganda of Hindi, denial of legitimate
representation and suppression in economy of the Muslims.
Lahore Session - March 20, 1940
‘’The areas in which Muslims are numerically in majority, as in north-western
and eastern zones of India, should be grouped to constitute the Independent
States in which the Constituent units would be autonomous and sovereign”.
In this session Jinnah in his Presidential address gave the famous two nation
theory as follows:
But the term Pakistan was not used in this session.
This idea took firm shape only in 1946.
Gandhi rejected the two-nation theory and said - My whole soul rebels against the
idea that Hinduism and Islam represent two antagonistic cultures and doctrines.
To assent to such a doctrine for me is denial of God.

Electromagnetic Waves &
Electromagnetic Spectrum
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Oscillation and Waves
• Periodic Motion
 A motion which repeats itself identically after a fixed interval of time,
is called a periodic motion.
 For example - Motion of arms of a clock, orbital motion of the earth
around the sun, motion of a simple pendulum etc.
• Oscillatory Motion
 A periodic motion taking place to and fro or back and forth about a
fixed point is called oscillatory motion.
• For example
 Motion of a simple pendulum.
 Motion of a loaded spring etc.
Oscillation and Waves
• If a particle oscillates with its own natural frequency without help of any
external periodic force. The oscillation is then called damped oscillation.
• When a body oscillates with the help of an external periodic force with a
frequency different from natural frequency of the body, then oscillation is
called forced oscillation.
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
• An oscillatory motion of constant amplitude and of single frequency
under a restoring force whose magnitude is proportional to the
displacement and always acts towards mean position, is called
Simple Harmonic Motion.
Characteristics of SHM
• When a particle executing SHM passes through the mean position:
 1. No force acts on the particle.
 2. Acceleration of the particle is zero.
 3. Velocity is maximum.
 4. Kinetic energy is maximum.
 5. Potential energy is zero.
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
• When a particle executing SHM is at the extreme end, then:
 1. Acceleration of the particle is maximum.
 2. Restoring force acting on particle is maximum.
 3. Velocity of particle is zero.
 4. Kinetic energy of particle is zero.
 5. Potential energy is maximum.
Simple Pendulum
• A heavy point mass suspended from a rigid support by means of an elastic
inextensible string, is called a simple pendulum.
• Time period of a simple pendulum is given by 𝑇 = 2𝜋√𝑙/𝑔
• The time period of a simple pendulum of infinite length is 84.6 min. The
time period of a second’s pendulum is 2 s. Its length on the earth is nearly
100 cm.
• Acceleration due to gravity decreases with altitude (height) and therefore
time period of a pendulum clock will increase and clock becomes slow.
Simple Pendulum
• If the bob of a simple pendulum is suspended from a metallic wire, then
the length of the pendulum increases with increase in temperature and
therefore its time period also increases.
• A girl is swinging over a swing. If she stands up over the swing, then the
effective length of the swing decreases and therefore, the time period of
oscillations decreases.
• A pendulum clock cannot be used in a space-ship because there is no
constant gravitational force.
• Damped Harmonic Motion
• When there is friction or any other force acting within an oscillating
system, the amplitudes of the oscillation decreases over time to this
damping force. This is called damped harmonic motion.
• Resonant Oscillations
• When a body oscillates with its own natural frequency (V0) with the help
of an external periodic force also called forced harmonic motion. And if
the frequency (v) provided by the external agent is equal to the natural
frequency of the body, the oscillations of the body are called resonant
oscillations.
Waves
• Wave is a flow or transfer of energy in the form of oscillation through a
medium – space or mass.
• Sea waves or tides, sound which we hear, photon of light travelling and
even the movement of small plants blown by the wind are all examples of
different types of waves. A simple wave illustration is as follows.
Types of Waves :
• Different types of waves have different set of characteristics. Based on
orientation of particle motion and direction of energy, there are three
categories – Longitudinal, Transverse and Surface waves
Types of Waves
• Longitudinal waves – In this type of wave, the movement of the particle
are parallel to the motion of the energy i.e. the displacement of the
medium is in the same direction to which the wave is moving. Example –
Sound Waves, Pressure Waves.
• Transverse waves – When the movement of the particles are at right
angles or perpendicular to the motion of the energy, then this type of
wave is known as Transverse wave. Light is an example of a transverse
wave. Some of the other examples are – ‘Polarized’ waves &
Electromagnetic waves.
• Water waves are an example of combination of both longitudinal and
transverse motions.
Types of Waves
Types of Waves
• Surface waves – In this type, the particles travel in a circular
motion.
• These waves usually occur at interfaces. Waves in the ocean and
ripples in a cup of water are examples of such waves.
Other types of waves
• Electromagnetic Waves – Wave of electric and magnetic fields that
propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum is known an
electromagnetic wave.
• Non-mechanical waves or electromagnetic waves:
• The waves which do not require medium for their propagation i.e. which
can propagate even through the vacuum are called non mechanical wave.
• Light, heat is the examples of non-mechanical wave. In fact all the
electromagnetic waves are non-mechanical.
• All the electromagnetic wave consists of photon. The wavelength range of
electromagnetic wave is 10−14m to 104 m.
Properties of electromagnetic waves
• 1. They are neutral (uncharged).
• 2. They propagate as transverse wave.
• 3. They propagate with the velocity of light.
• 4. They contain energy and momentum.
• 5. Their concept was introduced by Maxwell.
Non-electromagnetic Waves
• Following waves are not electromagnetic
 1. Cathode rays
 2. Canal rays
 3. α rays
 4. β rays
 5. Sound wave
 6. Ultrasonic wave
Electromagnetic Waves & their discoverer
• γ-Rays - Henry Becqueral
• X-Rays - W. Rontgen
• Ultra-violet rays - Ritter
• Visible radiation - Newton
• Infra-red rays - Hershel
• Short radio waves or Hertzian Waves - Heinrich Hertz
• Long Radio Waves - Marconi
Note: Electromagnetic waves of wavelength range 𝟏𝟎−𝟑 m to 𝟏𝟎−𝟐
m are called microwaves.
Electromagnetic Radiation
• Electromagnetic waves are perpendicular waves, combining the electric
and magnetic fields.
• Electromagnetic waves are produced when an electric charge vibrates or
accelerates and can travel through empty space or through matter.
• Electromagnetic radiation consists of this type of waves.
• A mechanical wave is a wave that transfers energy through a medium. This
is a contrast to the electromagnetic wave.
• Electromagnetic waves can travel longer distances with higher speed but
due to the medium of transfer, mechanical waves are limited.
Features of Waves
• Amplitude: Amplitude is defined as the maximum displacement of the
vibrating particle on either side from the equilibrium position.
• Wavelength: Wavelength is the distance between any two nearest particle
of the medium, vibrating in the same phase. It is denoted by the Greek
letter lambda. (λ)
• In transverse wave distance between two consecutive crests or troughs
and in longitudinal wave, distance between two consecutive compressions
or rarefactions is equal to wavelength.
Features of Waves
• Time period – The time taken by the vibration of the particles of the
medium in completing one oscillation is called Time period.
• Frequency – The number of oscillations executed by the particles of the
medium in one second is called frequency of wave. Its SI unit is Hertz.
Velocity of wave = frequency × wavelength.
ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
• Gamma Rays: Highest Frequency, Shortest Wavelength
• X Rays
• Ultraviolet Rays
• Visible Light
• Infra Red
• Microwaves
• Radio waves : Lowest Frequency, Longest Wavelength
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other.
Electromagnetic Spectrum Diagram

Speed of Electromagnetic Waves
• All electromagnetic waves travel at 3 × 108 m/s in a vacuum.
• Speed of a wave formula:
• Speed = frequency × wavelength
• As the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases.
• The more is the frequency, the more is the penetrability of the rays.
• Gamma rays have the highest penetrability but it is not used in place of x
rays as the gamma rays penetrates into the bones and does not reflect
back.
GAMMA RAYS
• They have the shortest wavelength and highest frequencies in the EM
spectrum. It is generated by:
 Changes in energy levels in the nucleus
 Some radioactive substances and certain nuclear reactions produce
gamma rays.
• Because of their great penetrating ability, gamma rays can cause serious
illness. However, when used in controlled conditions, gamma rays are
useful in cancer treatment.
GAMMA RAYS
• They are the highest energy electromagnetic wave.
• They usually come from radioactive elements or stars.
• The uses include:
 Killing cancer cells.
 Making pictures of the brain.
 Inspection tools In industry.
X -RAYS
• It was discovered by William roentgen.
• It is generated by:
 a) Rapid deceleration of fast moving electrons.
 b) Changes in energy of innermost orbital electrons.
• Principle of working:
• X-Rays have high penetrability but do not penetrate through bones. These
rays get reflected by the bones when pass through it and thus provide a
reflected image of the inner structure.
X -RAYS
• X-rays are used for :
 Diagnostic tool in dentistry and medicine. Doctors and dentists can
examine the condition of a person’s bones, the root of the teeth or the
state of other inner part of the body.
 Custom officers at airports inspect the content of your luggage using
X- rays.
 Industry wise, it is used to find cracks in structures just like cracks in
bones.
X -RAYS
• X- rays have high energy and can penetrate some material.
• Uses of x-rays :
 Medicines
 Industry
 Transportation
• Too much exposure can damage living tissue or even cause cancer.
ULTRAVIOLET RAYS
• UV rays, that is at a higher frequency and energy than violet light. It is
produced by sun rays and gets filtered by ozone in stratosphere.
• UV light can kill micro-organisms.
• Too much exposure can cause: Sunburn, wrinkles, cataract and skin cancer.
• UV can be detected by:
 Photographic plates
 Photoelectric cell
 Fluorescence
ULTRAVIOLET RAYS
• Uses of Ultraviolet
 Detect counterfeit notes
 Gives the clothes a ‘glow’ effect in discotheques
 Sun- tanning
 Sterilizes medical equipment- UV rays are used in hospitals to sterilize
the surgical instruments and operating theatres as it kills bacteria and
viruses.
Visible Light
Visible Light
• It is the part of the EM spectrum which can be detected by the human
eye.
• The visible light has its own spectrum which consists of the 7 colors of
light :
• VIBGYOR (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red), generally
occurs in the range of wavelength, 400nm to 720nm.
Prism
• Dispersion of white light from the Glass Prism
• When a monochromatic light is passed through the prism, the white light
deviates from its path and dispersed into seven colors. This band of
colored component of white light is called spectrum.
• Red light has highest wavelength and least frequency while violet has least
wavelength and highest frequency.
• Red light is generally used in traffic lights as it has the least scattering
power and thus covers long distance.
Prism
INFRARED WAVES
• Heat can be transferred through infrared radiation. They are heat waves,
all objects emit infrared waves because all objects possess heat.
• Night vision goggles detect infrared waves and allow the user to see the
movement of objects in the dark.
Uses:
• For navigation through fog and haze as it is less easily scattered compared
to visible light
• Medical treatment: to warm injured muscles/ sports injuries
• Many TV remotes use infrared.
MICROWAVES
• One of their most common uses is in microwave ovens. When you switch
on a microwave oven, it gives off electromagnetic waves that bounce
around inside the oven, penetrating the food.
• Water molecules in the food absorb the energy from the microwaves,
causing the food to get hot. The motor used in microwave is called
magnetron.
• Uses of Microwave:
 Radar communication
 Analysis of the molecular and atomic structure
 Telephone communications
RADIO WAVES
• These waves are the electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths
and lowest frequencies
• Like all electromagnetic waves, radio waves can travel through a vacuum.
• However, most of the radio waves we receive have travelled through air.
Take the radio as an example. The radio converts the electromagnetic
waves into the sound that comes out of the radio speakers.
• Mainly they are used for:
 Radar communications.
 TV and radio broadcasting.

Electronics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

• Electronics : It is a branch of physics and technology
concerned with the behaviour and movement of electrons.
• Diode valve : Designed by J.A.Fleming.
• It consists of two electrodes placed inside an evacuated
glass envelope.
• One electrode is called cathode which is made up of
tungsten on which there is a thin layer of barium oxide.
• When heated, cathode emits electrons. These electrons
flow towards the other electrode called anode or plate,
which is at positive potential.
• As a result an electric current is established in the circuit.
• The electrons emitted from cathode are collected in the evaluated space around it.
• This collection of electrons is called space charge which is obviously negative.
• Diode valve acts as a rectifier.
• Rectifier is a device which converts alternating voltage (current) into direct voltage
(current).
• Triode valve : Designed by Lee de Forest,
triode valve is a modified form of usual diode.
• It consists of a usual anode-cathode pair and
one more electrode called control grid.
• Triode valve can be used as amplifier,
oscillator, transmitter and detector.
Electric Current
• An electric current is a flow of microscopic particles called electrons
flowing through wires and components.
• The Current Always Flows In Positive To Negative Terminal.
• For current to flow you must have a complete circuit contains battery, key,
wire and bulb etc.
• A Power source is needed to create a Potential Difference (form greater Pd
to lower Pd). When these conditions are met free electrons move about
inside the metal. Charges will continue to move as long as the potential
difference (voltage) is maintained. It will not flow if the potential
difference of the conductor is same.
Measuring Current
• Specifically, electric current is the rate that electric charge passes a point,
so, Current = Charge/Time or I = q/t
• If a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in time t,
then the current I, through the cross-section isI = Q/t
• Unit of Electric Current: The SI unit of electric current is Ampere. Ampere
is defined as one coulomb of charge moving past a point in one second. If
there are 6.241 x 1018 electrons flowing through our frame in one second
then the electrical current flowing through it is ‘One Ampere.’
Question
• Calculate the average current in a wire through which a charge of
15C passes in 10s ?
• Solution
 I = 15C/10s = 1.5 C/s (Ampere)
 Charge pump is needed for maintaining the charge.
Properties of Electric Current
• Electric current is an important quantity in electronic circuits. We have
adapted electricity in our lives so much that it becomes impossible to
imagine life without it. Therefore, it is important to know the properties of
electric current.
• We know that electric current is the result of the flow of electrons.
• The work done in moving the electron stream is known as electrical
energy.
• The electrical energy can be converted into other forms of energy such as
heat energy, light energy, etc.
• For example, in an iron box, electric energy is converted to heat energy.
Likewise, the electric energy in a bulb is converted into light energy.
• There are two types of electric current known as alternating current (AC)
and direct current (DC).
• The direct current can flow only in one direction, whereas the alternating
direction flows in two directions.
• Direct current is seldom used as a primary energy source in industries. It
mostly used in low voltage applications such as charging batteries, aircraft
applications, etc.
• Alternating current is used to operate appliances for both household and
industrial and commercial use.
• The electric current is measured in ampere. One ampere of current
represents one coulomb of electric charge moving past a specific point in
one second.
1 ampere = 1 coulomb / 1 second
• The conventional direction of an electric current is the direction in which a
positive charge would move.
• Henceforth, the current flowing in the external circuit is directed away
from the positive terminal and toward the negative terminal of the
battery.
Heating Effect of Electric Current
• When our clothes are crumpled, we use the iron box to make our clothes
crisp and neat. Well, you might wonder how does the iron box get hot?
• The heating effect of electric current is the answer to this. There are many
such devices that work on the heating effect.
• When an electric current flows through a conductor, heat is generated in
the conductor.
• The heating effect depends on the following factor:
 The time ‘t‘ for which the current flows : The longer the current flows
in a conductor more heat is generated.
Heating Effect of Electric Current
 The electrical resistance of the conductor : Higher the
resistance, higher the heat produced.
 The amount of current : The larger the amount of current
higher the heat produced.
 The heating effect is given by the following equation
H=I
2RT
Magnetic Effect
• When current flows through a wire, a magnetic field is developed around it.
• If a current-carrying wire is brought near to a bar of iron, it gets magnetised and
when the current flow is stopped, the iron bar loses its magnetism.
• Electromagnets produced in this way have lot of applications.
• They are used for lifting and transporting steel plates, scrap iron etc.
• They are also used in electric bells, telephone receivers, etc.
• Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. The direction
of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a north pole of the
compass needle moves inside it.
Magnetic Effect
• Therefore it is taken by convention that the
field lines emerge from North Pole and
merge at the South Pole.
• Inside the magnet, the direction of field
lines is from its south pole to its north pole.
Thus the magnetic field lines are closed
curves.
• The relative strength of the magnetic field
is shown by the degree of closeness of the
field lines.
• The field is stronger, that is, the force
acting on the pole of another magnet
placed is greater where the field lines are
crowded.
Magnetic Effect
• No two field-lines are found to cross each other.
• If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass
needle would point towards two directions, which is not possible.
• An electric current through a metallic conductor produces a magnetic field
around it.
Chemical Effect, Electrolysis
• When electric current passes through a
solution, it results in decomposition of the
solution into negative and positive ions.
• Positive ions are collected at the negative
electrode i.e. cathode and negative ions
are collected at the positive electrode i.e.
anode. This process is called electrolysis.
This process is widely used in
electroplating.
• For example, chromium plating is done on
many objects such as car parts, bath taps,
kitchen gas burners, bicycle handlebars,
wheel rims and many others.
Chemical Effect, Electrolysis
• Tin cans, used for storing food, are made by electroplating tin onto iron.
Tin is less reactive than iron. Thus, food does not come into contact with
iron and is protected from getting spoilt.
• Iron is used in bridges and automobiles to provide strength. However, iron
tends to corrode and rust. So, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron to
protect it from corrosion and formation of rust.
LEDs
• LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are available in
many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue,
white and are increasingly being used for
many applications, for example in traffic signal
lights.
• LEDs are increasingly being used for lighting.
• A cluster of white LEDs grouped together
forms a LED light source.
• LED light sources consume less electricity and
have longer lifetime than light bulbs and
fluorescent tubes.
• But LED light sources are expensive, so CFLs
are currently the best choice.
CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamp)
• However, CFLs (compact fluorescent
lamp) contain mercury which is toxic.
• Therefore, used or broken CFLs need to be
disposed off safely.
• Once the technological advances reduce
the cost of LEDs, they will become the
preferred lighting source.
Electric Motor
• In an electric motor, electric energy is converted into
mechanical energy.
• Electric motors are used in electric fans, washing
machines etc.
• In loudspeakers, energy is transferred from electric
current into mechanical energy of vibration.
• A device that reverses the direction of flow of
current through a circuit is called a commutator.
• In electric motors, the split ring acts as a
commutator. The reversal of current also reverses
the direction of force.
Electric Motor
• The commercial motors use:
 an electromagnet in place of permanent
magnet;
 large number of turns of the conducting
wire in the current carrying coil; and
 a soft iron core on which the coil is
wound.
• The soft iron core, on which the coil is
wound, plus the coils, is called an armature.
This enhances the power of the motor.
Galvanometer
• A galvanometer is an instrument
that can detect the presence of a
current in a circuit.
• The pointer remains at zero (the
centre of the scale) for zero
current flowing through it.
• It can deflect either to the left or
to the right of the zero mark
depending on the direction of
current.
Electric Generator (Dynamo)
• In a generator, the armature is rotated
in the magnetic field and an emf is
generated in it due to electromagnetic
induction.
• Thus a generator converts mechanical
energy into electrical energy.
• With a minor change in construction, a
generator can produce alternating emf
or direct emf.
• The corresponding currents produced
are called alternating Current (ac) and
direct Current (dc).
Inverter
• An inverter converts DC to AC. The
inverters for home and office purpose
are designed to convert DC from a
battery to AC, and also to charge the
battery.
• If there is a power failure, the inverter
automatically switches on the AC,
converted from the battery’s DC.
• After the mains supply is restored, the
inverter automatically switches to a
mode where it starts charging the
battery.
Electric Potential And Potential Difference
• The electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit
carrying some current is the work done to move a unit charge from one
point to the other;
• Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge
(Q)
V = W/Q
• The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after
Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist.

Electric Potential And Potential Difference
• One volt is the potential difference between two points in a current
carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1
coulomb from one point to the other.
• The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called
the voltmeter.
• The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the points between
which the potential difference is to be measured.
Type of Materials
• Conductors are those type of materials which have number of free
electrons to conduct the electricity.
• The metals are good conductors of electricity.
• Metals like silver, iron, copper and earth acts like a conductor.
• Silver is the best conductor.
• Insulators are that type of materials which do not have the free electrons
in its volume and hence, it does not conduct the electricity at all.
• Metals like wood, paper, mica, glass, ebonite are insulators.

Type of Materials
• Semiconductor is that type of
materials which do not have
free electrons at the normal
temperature, but has the free
electrons at the increased
temperature and hence,
behaves like a conductor.
• The materials such as silicon,
germanium etc., are the
semiconductor.

• Intrinsic Semiconductor : A semi conductor is an extremely pure form is known as intrinsic
semi conductor.
• Extrinsic Semiconductor : If a measured and small amount of chemical impurity is added to
intrinsic semi conductor, it is called extrinsic semiconductor or doped semi conductor. As a
result of doping, there is a large increase in its conductivity.
• Extrinsic semi conductors are of two types :
• A) N type semi conductor : An extrinsic semi conductor in which electrons are majority
charge carrier is called N type semi conductor. Such a semi conductor is made by doping a
pure semi conductor with pentavalent impurity like Arsenic, Antimony and Phosphorus.
• B) P type semi conductor : An extrinsic semi conductor in which holes are majority charge
carrier is called P type semi conductor. Such a semi conductor is made by doping a pure semi
conductor with trivalent impurity like Gallium, Indium, Boron and Aluminium.

Terms associated
• Doping : Adding of chemical impurity to a pure semi
conductor is called doping. The amount and type of impurity
is closely controlled.
• Donor : Pentavalent impurity are called donor.
• Acceptor : Trivalent impurity are called acceptor.
• The electrical conductivity of a semi conductor increases with
the increase in the temperature.

EMERGENCY
PROVISIONS
By – Dr.Vipan Goyal

• The Emergency provisions are contained in Part XVIII of the Constitution, from Articles
352 to 360.
• These provisions enable the Central government to meet any abnormal situation
effectively.
• Its aim is to safeguard the sovereignty, unity, integrity and security of the country, the
democratic political system, and the Constitution.
• During Emergency it converts the federal structure into a unitary one without a formal
amendment of the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
INTRODUCTION
©StudyIQ Education
• This kind of transformation of the political system from federal during normal times to
unitary during Emergency is a unique feature of the Indian Constitution.
• In this context, Dr B R Ambedkar observed in the Constituent Assembly that :
‘All federal systems including American are placed in a tight mould of federalism.
 No matter what the circumstances, it cannot change its form and shape.
 It can never be unitary.
On the other hand, the Constitution of India can be both unitary as well as federal
according to the requirements of time and circumstances.
In normal times, it is framed to work as a federal system.
But in times of Emergency, it is so designed as to make it work as though it was a unitary
system.’
©StudyIQ Education
The Constitution stipulates three types of emergencies:
1. Article 352 – An emergency due to war, external aggression or armed rebellion.
This is popularly known as ‘National Emergency’. However, the Constitution
employs the expression ‘proclamation of emergency’ to denote an emergency of
this type.
2. Article 356 – An Emergency due to the failure of the constitutional machinery in
the states. This is popularly known as ‘President’s Rule’. It is also known by two
other names—‘State Emergency’ or ‘Constitutional Emergency’.
 However, the Constitution does not use the word ‘emergency’ for this situation.
3. Article 360 – Financial Emergency due to a threat to the financial stability or credit
of India.
©StudyIQ Education
National Emergency
Grounds of Declaration
• Under Article 352, the President can declare a national emergency
 when the security of India or a part of it is threatened by
war
or
external aggression
or
armed rebellion*
• President can declare a national emergency even before the actual occurrence of war or
external aggression or armed rebellion, if he is satisfied that there is an imminent danger.
*Originally, the Constitution mentioned ‘internal disturbance’ as the third ground for the proclamation
of a National Emergency, but the expression was too vague and had a wider connotation
• National Emergency declared on grounds of war or external aggression it
is known as External Emergency.
• When it is declared on the grounds of armed rebellion it is known as
Internal Emergency.
©StudyIQ Education
• A proclamation of national emergency may be applicable to the entire country or only a
part of it (42nd Amendment Act).
Additions through 44th Amendment Act of 1978
• Substituted the words ‘armed rebellion’ for ‘internal disturbance’.
• The President can proclaim a national emergency only after receiving a written
recommendation from the cabinet - A safeguard to eliminate any possibility of the prime
minister alone taking a decision in this regard.
• Deleted the provision placed by 38th Amendment Act of 1975 declaring National
Emergency was immune from the judicial review.
• 2 months  1 month for parliamentary approval
• Periodic approval every 6 months
• Simple  special majority
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
• National Emergency should be approved by both the Houses of Parliament within one
month from the date of its issue.
• If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the emergency continues for
 6 months and can be extended to an indefinite period with an approval of the
Parliament for every 6 months. (44th Amendment Act of 1978)
• Every resolution approving the proclamation of emergency or its continuance must be
passed by either House of Parliament by a special majority, that is
(a)a majority of the total membership of that house, and
(b)a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that house present and
voting. (44th Amendment Act of 1978)
©StudyIQ Education
Revocation of Proclamation
• Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.
• Further, the President must revoke a proclamation if the Lok Sabha passes a
resolution disapproving its continuation.
• The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 also provided that, where one-tenth of the
total number of members of the Lok Sabha give a written notice to the Speaker
(or to the president if the House is not in session), a special sitting of the House
should be held within 14 days for the purpose of considering a resolution
disapproving the continuation of the proclamation.
©StudyIQ Education
Effects of National Emergency
1. Effect on the Centre-State Relations
• The normal fabric of the Centre-state relations undergoes a basic change which
can be examined under three forms.
a) Executive:
• The state governments are brought under the complete control of the Centre,
though they are not suspended.
©StudyIQ Education
b) Legislative:
• During a national emergency, the Parliament becomes empowered to make
laws on any subject mentioned in the State List.
• Although the legislative power of a state legislature is not suspended.
• President can issue ordinances on the state subjects also, if the Parliament is
not in session.
©StudyIQ Education
c) Financial:
• While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the President can
modify the constitutional distribution of revenues between the centre and the
states.
©StudyIQ Education
2. Effects on the Life of the Lok Sabha and the State Assembly
• While a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation, the life of the
Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal term (five years) by a law of
Parliament for one year at a time (for any length of time).
• This extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months after the
emergency has ceased to operate.
• Similarly, the Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a state legislative
assembly (five years) by one year each time (for any length of time) during a
national emergency, subject to a maximum period of six months after the
Emergency has ceased to operate.
©StudyIQ Education
3. Effect on the Fundamental Rights:
• Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of a National Emergency on the
Fundamental Rights.
• Article 358 deals with the suspension of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by
Article 19, while Article 359 deals with the suspension of other Fundamental
Rights (except those guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21).
a) Suspension Fundamental Rights under Article 19:
• The six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 are automatically suspended
• the state can make any law or can take any executive action abridging or
taking away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19.
• Any such law or executive action cannot be challenged on the ground that
they are inconsistent with the six Fundamental Rights.
©StudyIQ Education
• After Emergency ends Article 19 automatically revives
44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358
• The six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended only when
the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war or external
aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion.
©StudyIQ Education
b) Suspension of other Fundamental Rights
• Article 359 authorizes the president to suspend the right to move any court
for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency.
• Fundamental rights are not suspended, but only their enforcement and the
right to seek remedy.
©StudyIQ Education
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 359 in two
ways.
• The President cannot suspend the right to move the Court for the
enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 20 to 21.
©StudyIQ Education
Declarations Made So Far
This kind of emergency (352) has been proclaimed three times do far in 1962, 1971
and 1975
1. October 1962 – Chinese aggression in the NEFA (now Arunachal Pradesh) and was
in force till January 1968
2. December 1971 – War with Pakistan
3. June 1975 – Third Emergency was proclaimed while the second Emergency was
still in operation.
• Both the second and the third proclamations were revoked in March 1977.
• The first two proclamations (1962 and 1971) were made on the ground of external
aggression while third was made on grounds of internal disturbance.
©StudyIQ Education
The Emergency of 1975
©StudyIQ Education
Controversial because imposed by the then PM Mrs. Indira Gandhi mainly
to retain political control.
Cause - Internal disturbance – police and army instigated
Raj Narain case – 12 June 1975
Allahabad high court ruled against the PM for electoral malpractice in 1971
elections
Disqualified as member of Lok sabha and barred her from contesting again
for 6 years
26 June 1975 – 21 March 1977
President - Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed

President’s Rule
Grounds of Imposition
• Article 355 imposes a duty on the Centre to ensure that the government of every
state is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
• Centre takes over the government of a state under Article 356
 in case of failure of constitutional machinery in state.
• Popularly known as ‘President’s Rule’. It is also known as ‘State Emergency’ or
‘Constitutional Emergency’.
©StudyIQ Education
The President’s Rule can be proclaimed under Article 356 on two grounds —one
mentioned in Article 356 itself and another in Article 365.
• Article 356 empowers the President to issue a proclamation, if he is satisfied that a
situation has arisen in which the government of a state cannot be carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
 Notably, the president can act either on a report of the governor of the state or even
without the governor’s report.
• Article 365 says that whenever a state fails to comply with or to give effect to any
direction from the Centre, it will be lawful for the president to hold that a situation
has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
• A proclamation imposing President’s Rule must be approved by both the Houses
of Parliament within 2 months from the date of its issue.
• If the proclamation of President’s Rule is issued when the Lok Sabha has been
dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes within the two months
without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days
from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya
Sabha approves it in the mean time.
• If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the President’s Rule continues for
6 months.
• It can be extended for a maximum period of 3 years with the approval of the
Parliament, every six months.
©StudyIQ Education
• Every resolution approving the proclamation of President’s Rule or its continuation can
be passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is, a majority of
the members of that House present and voting.
44th Amendment Act –
Beyond 1 year, the President’s Rule can be extended by six months at a time only when the
following two conditions are fulfilled
1) A proclamation of National Emergency should be in operation in the whole of India,
or in the whole or any part of the state; and
2) The Election Commission must certify that the general elections to the legislative
assembly of the concerned state cannot be held on account of difficulties.
REVOCATION
• President’s Rule may be revoked by the President at any time by a
subsequent proclamation.
• Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.
©StudyIQ Education
Consequences of President’s Rule
The President acquires the following extraordinary powers when the President’s Rule is
imposed in a state:
1. He can take up the functions of the state government and powers vested in the
governor or any other executive authority in the state.
2. He can declare that the powers of the state legislature are to be exercised by the
Parliament.
3. He can take all other necessary steps including the suspension of the constitutional
provisions relating to any body or authority in the state.
©StudyIQ Education
• Therefore, when the President’s Rule is imposed in a state, the President
dismisses the state council of ministers headed by the chief minister.
*** The state governor, on behalf of the President, carries on the state
administration with the help of the chief secretary of the state or the advisors
appointed by the President.
• Further, the President either suspends or dissolves the state legislative assembly.
• The Parliament passes the state legislative bills and the state budget.
©StudyIQ Education
Since 1950, the President’s Rule has been imposed on more than 100
occasions,
Further, on a number of occasions, the President’s Rule has been imposed in
an arbitrary manner for political or personal reasons.
Hence, Article 356 has become one of the most controversial and most
criticised provision of the Constitution.
For the first time, the President’s Rule was imposed in Punjab in 1951.
©StudyIQ Education
Financial Emergency
Grounds of Declaration
• Article 360 - empowers the president to proclaim a Financial Emergency if he is
satisfied that a situation has arisen due to which the financial stability or credit of
India or any part of its territory is threatened.
• 44th Amendment Act – implied that the satisfaction of the President is not beyond
judicial review.
©StudyIQ Education
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
• A proclamation declaring financial emergency must be approved by both the Houses
of Parliament within two months from the date of its issue.
• When the Lok Sabha is dissolved or takes place during the two month duration
without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days
from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya
Sabha has in the meantime approved.
• Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial Emergency continues
indefinitely till it is revoked.
Thus
1. there is no maximum period prescribed for its operation; and
2. repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its continuation.
©StudyIQ Education
• A resolution approving the proclamation of financial emergency can be passed by
either House of Parliament only by a simple majority
• A proclamation of Financial Emergency may be revoked by the president at anytime
by a subsequent proclamation.
• Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.

Financial Inclusion
and Inflation
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Financial Inclusion
The process which ensures access to financial services to all
sections of the society especially vulnerable/weaker sections.
Government measures in the pre-reform era
1. Nationalization of Banks (in 1969, 14 commercial banks were nationalised)
2. Priority Sector Lending Policy
3. Lead Bank scheme
4. Service Area scheme
5. Establishment of Regional Rural Banks
6. NABARD was established in 1982
7. Cooperative Banks
8. SIDBI was established in 1989
9. SHG – bank linkage group
Measures by Government
• Latest Measures by the Government to achieve financial inclusion
1. No frills account
2. Business Correspondent Scheme (Bank Saathi Yojana) renamed as
Swabhimaan scheme
3. Post Offices Bank scheme
4. Micro Finance Institutions
5. Pension Schemes
6. Micro Insurance Schemes
7. Developmental Schemes like MNREGA
Inclusive growth Vs Financial Inclusion
• Inclusive growth is a much broader term.
• It means that the benefits of growth should percolate down to all.
• Financial Inclusion means bringing all under the Financial services cloud
which is required for inclusive growth.
• That is, in other words nobody is left behind in accessing Financial
services.
• Hence Inclusive growth includes within itself financial inclusion.
Inflation
• Inflation means increase in average prices of goods and services in a long
period of time.
• It is macro concept, where in the effect of inflation is seen over a large
basket of goods.
• Ultimate effect of inflation is that the value of money is reduced i.e., the
purchasing power of money is reduced.
Type of Inflation
• 1. Demand-Pull Inflation
 Caused due to increase in aggregate demand in the economy.
 Causes: Increase in money supply, Increase in money supply, Increase in
Forex reserves, Deficit financing by government, Increase of Exports,
Depreciation of Currency.
 Increase in foreign-exchange reserves
 Increase in government expenditure
o Due to fiscal stimulus
o Increased borrowing
 Depreciation of rupee
Type of Inflation
• 2. Cost-Push Inflation
 Caused due to reduction in aggregate supply in the economy.
 Causes: Increase in price of inputs, Hoarding and Speculation of
commodities, Defective Supply chain, Increase in indirect taxes,
Depreciation of Currency, Crude oil price fluctuation, Defective food
supply chain, Low growth of Agricultural sector, Interest rates was
increased by RBI
Remedies
• 1. Monetary Policy (Contractionary policy)
• 2. Fiscal Policy measure
 Direct and Indirect taxes (Direct taxes should be increased and indirect taxes
should be reduced).
 Public Expenditure should be decreased (should borrow less from RBI and
more from other financial institutions)
• 3. Supply Management measures
 Import commodities which are in short supply
 Decrease exports
 Govt. may put a check on hoarding and speculation
 Distribution through PDS
Constraints faced to control Inflation
• Constraints in controlling cost push inflation
 Prices of imported commodities – crude oil prices increased
 Depreciation of rupee
 Food inflation because of defective supply chain
 Low growth of agriculture sector
 Increase in interest rates
 Increase in Public Expenditure and Budgetary deficit
• Constraints in controlling demand pull
 Foreign investment is increasing
 Depreciation of rupee
Impact of Inflation
• Positive Impact
 Inflation is good for the economy upto reasonable limits. This
according to RBI is 2 to 6 percent.
 Moderate inflation stimulates growth.
• Negative Impact
 Real income of people would decrease.
 Inflation is regressive in nature.
 Would increase income inequalities.
Impact of Inflation
 Capital formation is adversely affected.
 Interest rates were increased by RBI.
 Distorts Resource allocation.
 Promotes generation of Black Money.
 Standard of living would reduce.
 Promote hoarding and speculation.
 Adversely effects BOP situation.
EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUALS
• Businessman, Borrowers
 During Inflation : They make huge profits because the price of
final product is rising at a much faster speed than the price of
raw materials.
 During Deflation : They make losses because prices of final
products fall faster than the cost of production.
EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUALS
• Fixed Income Groups, Lenders
 During Inflation : - Salaried individual, pensions suffer. Lenders suffer
because even if borrowed money is returned their ‘real Purchasing
Power would have declined.
 During Deflation : While they will benefit because the value
(=purchasing power) of money will increase.
EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUALS
• Currency itself
 During Inflation : Since rupee’s purchasing power will decline, its
exchange rate value will weaken against foreign currencies, as
foreigners get less keen to buy from India.
 During Deflation : Reverse will happen.
Phillip’s Curve
Measurement of Inflation
• Inflation is measured with the help of Index numbers. Index
numbers are numbers that measure change in any variable.
• There are two types of Index numbers
 Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
 Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
• Based in 676 commodities
• Estimated by Min of Industry and Commerce
• Measured on a monthly basis, but with a lag of 14 days.
• Base year is 2004-05
• Item Included : Primary Articles, Fuel and Power, Manufactured Items etc.
• Note: WPI was revised in 2010. It was revised on the recommendation of
Prof. Abhijit Sen committee. Earlier the base year for WPI was 1993-94.
• In India, general rate of inflation is measured by WPI.
Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
• Different methods to measure WPI
 Point to Point inflation
o Inflation is compared between two points in time, usually a
month’s inflation rate.
 52 week average method
o Average of previous 52 week’s point to point inflation is
taken.
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
• It shows the impact of inflation on a common man (increase in cost
of living).
• CPI is based on retail prices.
• Is available on a monthly basis.
• There are four types of CPI
Types of CPI
• CPI for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW)
 Base year: 2001
 Weightage of food items is 46%
 Measured by Labour Bureau
• CPI for Urban Non-Manual Employees (CPI-UNME)
 Base year: 1984-85
 This is used to provide grant by some MNC’s
Types of CPI
• CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL)
 Base year: 1986-87
 Used for the fixation of minimum wages
 This is used for revision of wages under MNREGA
• CPI for Rural Labourers (CPI-RL)
 Base year: 1986-87
New CPI introduced by CSO
• In 2011, CSO introduced three new CPI’s
 CPI – Urban
 CPI – Rural
 CPI – Combined
• The reason to introduce these new CPI’s was that there was no single CPI
that could give the effect of inflation as a common man residing in India
would experience. Base year for all the three CPI’s is 2010.
Why Inflation is high on CPI as compared to WPI?
• Weightage of food is high in CPI than when compared to WPI.

Definition of P-Notes
• Participatory Notes or P-notes are offshore derivative instruments, used by Foreign
Institutional Investors (FIIs) who are NOT registered with SEBI.
• They are used on Indian shares, but at a location outside of India.
• The above implies that FIIs who are not registered with SEBI but wish to take exposure in
the Indian securities markets can use P-notes.
• Brokers buy or sell securities on behalf of their clients on their proprietary account and
issue such notes in favour of such foreign investors.
• The P-note holder is entitled to all the dividends, capital gains and other payouts on the
underlying securities.
• The brokerages or FIIs have to compulsorily report the P-note issuance status every
quarter to SEBI.
• In doing so, the identity of the client or the final investor can be hidden.
• Overseas investors are a source of worry to SEBI as they have become an
easy route for money laundering i.e. aid in movement of black money or
unaccounted transactions.
Holding & Subsidiary Company
• Holding Company
 A company that owns majority shares in another company. E.g. Tata
Sons ltd. Holds majority shares of Tata Steel, Tata Sky etc
• Subsidiary Company
 A company that is controlled by a parent Holding Company. E.g TCS,
Tata Steel, Tata Sky are subsidiary companies of Tata Sons.

 The revolutionary terrorist movement was largely the outcome of the same
set of causes which gave rise to the extremist wing in the national politics.
 Only the revolutionaries wanted quicker results and discounted the value of
persuasion and low-grade pressure.
 The revolutionaries believed that the British rule was destructive of all that
is worthwhile in national life- political liberties, religious freedom, morality
and Indian culture.
 Methods – Western methods of Violence – Bombs and revolvers
2 phases of Revolutionary movement broadly speaking :
1. Phase 1 – 1890s- 1918
2. Phase 2 – 1920s onwards
PHASE 1
 In the early part of the 20th century, revolutionary groups sprang up mainly
in Bengal, Maharashtra, Punjab and Madras.
 The revolutionaries were not satisfied with the methods of both the
moderates and extremists.
 Hence, they started many revolutionary secret organizations.
 In Bengal Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were established.
 In Maharashtra Savarkar brothers had set up Abhinava Bharat.
 In the Madras Presidency, Bharathmatha Association was started by
Nilakanta Bramachari.
 In Punjab , Ajit Singh set up a secret society to spread revolutionary ideas
among the youth.
 In London, at India House, Shyamji Krishna Verma gathered young Indian
nationalists like Madan Lal Dhingra, Savarkar, V.V.S. Iyer and T.S.S.Rajan.
 Lala Hardayal set up the ‘Ghadar Party’ in USA to organise revolutionary
activities from outside India.
 Following were the highlights of the revolutionary activities in Maharashtra:
 Started by Chitpavan Brahmins of Poona
 Assassination of Rand and Ayerst by Chapekar Brothers
 On June 22, 1897, Damodar Chapekar and Balkrishna Chapekar- famous as
Chapekar Brothers - assassinated two British officials named Rand and
Ayerst at Poona.
 The Chapekar brothers were disillusioned with the British administration for
its indifferent attitude towards plague at Pune.
 In 1899, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his brother Ganesh
Savarkar organised a secret society Mitramela at Nashik
 In 1904, V.D. Savarkar organised the Abhinava Bharat, a secret society of
revolutionaries.
 In 1909, Anant Kanhare of Abhinava Bharat, assassinated Jackson, the
judge of Nasik, Jackson had sentenced Ganesh Savarkar to deportation to
Andaman on the charge of sedition. Ganesh’s crime was that he had
composed some patriotic songs.
 The youth of Bengal found peaceful protests and political actions getting no
results and they no longer believed that passive resistance could achieve the
nationalist aims.
 They fell back upon individual action and the cult of bomb.
 In 1902, Pramatho Mitra, Jatindranath Banerjee and Barindra kumar Ghosh
founded the Anushilan Samiti, a secret society and promoting
revolutionary activities.
 Decca Anushilan Samiti was founded by Pulin Das in East Bengal.
 Yuganter group - in Calcutta
 Apart from Decca Anushilan Samiti, there were four other prominent
samities in Mymensingh, Faridpur, Bakargunj and Burisal in East Bengal.
 In 1905, Barindra Kumar Ghosh published Bhavani Mandir.
 In 1906, Barindra Kumar Ghosh and Bhupendranath Dutta started the
paper Yuganter, in which they had inspired country's youth to begin an
armed revolution.
 On December23, 1907, the revolutionaries shot the magistrate of Dacca at
the Faridpur railway station.
 They even tried to assassinate the Lt.Governors of Bengal
 In April 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki threw a bomb at a
carriage which they believed was occupied by Kingsford, the unpopular
judge of Muzzaffarpur (now in Bihar).But the bomb killed two ladies.
 Khudiram was hanged, while Prafulla Chaki shot himself dead.
 The Ghosh brothers, along with others were arrested and tried (Alipore
Conspiracy case) for the act
 Punjab was not far behind Bengal.
 In 1904, J.M. Chaterjee set up an organisation with Lala Hardayal ,Ajit Singh
and Sufi Amba Prasad to spread revolutionary activities in Punjab. They
protested for farmers rights
 After his release from jail in 1907, Sardar Ajit Singh began establishing
revolutionary outfits in many places.
 In November 1908, the deputy superintendent of police of Lyallpur and his
orderly were assassinated. It was perhaps the first political incident of its
kind in Punjab.
 In December 1909, a bomb was exploded in the house of the deputy collector
of Ambala.
 Bombing of Lord Hardinge II and the Delhi Conspiracy Case : On
December 23, 1912 Rash Behari Bose and Sachin Sanyal threw bomb on
Viceroy Lord Hardinge II who was leading a procession in Delhi to celebrate
the occasion of the city becoming the new capital of India.
 Lord Hardinge escaped with minor injuries but his attendant died on the
spot.
13 people were arrested and tried in what is known as Delhi Conspiracy
Case. Dina Nath, one of the arrested, became government approver under
pressure. Four persons-Master Amir Chand, Awadh Bihari, Bal Mukund and
Basant Kumar Biswas were hanged.
 Rash Behari Bose succeeded in fleeing to Japan.
 Revolutionaries Activities in the
West
 The revolutionaries also established centres of activity abroad.
 In London the lead was taken by Shyamji Krishnavarma, V.D
Savarkar and Lala Har Dayal.
 In 1905, Shyamji Krishnavarma setup the India Home Rule
Society popularly known as the India House(after the house where
they lived and HQ of the society)
 He also published a monthly journal of the society, called The Indian
Sociologist.
 6 scholarships of Rs 1000 for Indians

 On July 1, 1909, Madan Lal Dhingra shot dead Mr. Curzon Wyllie, the
Assistant of the Secretary for State for India in London.
 Dhingra was sentenced to death on August 16, 1909 and India House
activities were cracked down upon by British Police.
 Savarkar was deported to India and Shyamji Krishnavarma fled and
settled in Paris
 During early 1900s, Canadian govt. had started imposing restriction on the
immigration and political rights of South Asians.
 Ghadar Party was established at San Francisco, USA in 1913 by the efforts of
Lala Hardayal, Ramchandra, Bhagwan Singh, Kartar Singh Saraba,
Barkatulla & Bhai Parmanand. Sohan singh Bhakna – first pres.
 To carry out revolutionary activities, the earlier activists had set up a
‘Swadesh Sevak Home’ at Vancouver and ‘United India House’ in Seattle.
 They started weekly journal “Ghadar”, in English and vernacular languages to
expose British exploitation of Indian economy and promote Nationalism
among masses. Thus, became famous as “Ghadar” party.
 Kartar Singh Saraba, one of the founders of the party, wrote in the first
issue:
"Today there begins 'Ghadar' in foreign lands, but in our country's
tongue, a war against the British Raj.
 What is our name? Ghadar.
 What is our work? Ghadar.
 Where will be the Revolution? In India.
The time will soon come when rifles and blood will take the place
of pens and ink."
 The importance of this event lies in the fact that it created an explosive
situation in the Punjab.
 Komagata Maru was the name of a ship which was carrying 370 passengers,
mainly Sikh and some Punjabi Muslim would-be immigrants, from
Singapore to Vancouver , Canada
 They were turned back by Canadian authorities after two months of
privation & uncertainty.
 It was generally believed that the Canadian authorities were influenced by
British Government.

 The ship finally anchored at Calcutta in September 1914 but the inmates
refused to board the Punjab-bound train.
 In the ensuing confrontation with police near Calcutta, 22 persons died.
 Inflamed by this and with the outbreak of the War, the Ghadar leaders
decided to launch violent attack on British rule in India.
 They urged fighters to go to India.
 Bengal revolutionaries were contacted; Political dacoities were committed to
raise funds mainly in Punjab.
 Thus, an explosive situation was created in Punjab
Repressive legislation :
 Prevention of seditious meetings act 1907
 Explosive substances act 1908
 Criminal law amendment act 1908
 Newspaper (incitement to offences) act 1908
 Press act 1910
 Defence of India Act 1915**
Decline in revolutionary activity after 1918 due to
 Tough laws, crackdown by police, talk of self rule/responsible govt,
 Arrival of Gandhiji and non violent methods

Contact With Outside World
• The most important political developments of
the Post-Maurya period was the onslaught of
foreigners from the north-west.
• The first among them were the Bactrian
Greeks, known in earlier Indian literature as
Yavanas; the word was derived from the Old
Persian from Yauna, signifying Greeks.
Indo-Greeks
• Central Asian Contact:
• The first to invade India were the
Greeks or Bactrian Greeks who
were called the Indo-Greeks or
Bactrian Greeks in the early
second century B.C.
• The history of the Indo-Greeks has
been reconstructed mainly on the
evidence of their coins bearing
legends in Greek and later in
Brahmi as well.
Indo-Greeks
• Demetrius,king of Bactria was
perhaps the first foreign (Indo-Greek)
king after Alexander who carried
Greek arms into the interior of India.
• He reduced to submission a
considerable portion of Afghanistan,
the Punjab and Sind.
• From Taxila he sent his 2
commanders, Appolodotus &
Menander for further conquest
• Appolodotus conquered Sindh &
marched upto Ujjain
Indo-Greeks
• The best remembered of the IndoGreek kings was Menander, (165-145 D
C.) who, as Milinda, attained fame in
the Buddhist text Milindapanho or the
question of Milinda-a catechismal
discussion in Buddhism supposedly
conducted by Menander and the
Buddhist philosopher Nagasena,
resulting in Menander’s conversion to
Buddhism.
• Menander stabilised Indo-Greek
power, in addition to extending its
frontiers in India.
Indo-Greeks
• He had his capital at Sakala (modern Sialkot) in
Punjab. There is little doubt that the attempted
to conquer territory in the Ganges valley, but
he failed to retain it.
• He may well have attacked the Sungas in the
Yamuna region, if not Pataliputra itself.
• A Brahmi inscription engraved on a Garuda
Pillar/ Heliodorus pilar found are Besnager near
Vidisa (MP) records that Antialcidas of Taxila
sent an ambassador, named Heliodorus, to the
court of Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, identified with
the last but one Sunga, Bhagavata.
Indo-Greeks
• Helidorus in this inscription professes to be a follower of Vasudeva,
associated with the God Vishnu.
• A Greek ambassador, Heliodorus, became vaishnavite (Vasudev worshiper
mainly) & erected ‘Garuda Pillar’ at Besnagar (Vidisa) – MP
• Hemaeus was the last Indo- Greek ruler who has to maintain his
precarious hold against the advancing menace of the Sakas, Parthians and
the Yuechis.
Importance of the Indo-Greek rule
• The Indo-Greeks were the first to issue coins which can be definitely attributed to the kings.
• They were the first to issue gold coins in India which increased in number under the Kushans.
1. The Greeks also introduced the practice of military governorship called strategos for
maintaining the power of the new rulers over the conquered people.
2. The Greek rule introduced features of Hellenistic art in the North-west frontier of India. The
Gandhara art was largely Hellenistic in the beginning, but as time passed the style became
more and more Indian and less and less Greek. The idea of representing the Buddha as a
human being (idol worship) originated with the Greeks.
3. The Greeks contributed to the development of the Indian theatre by the use of curtains
(known as Yavanika, Sutradhara (stage manager), Nepathya (back stage, etc.)
4. Indian astrology came to be influenced by Greek ideas, and from the Greek term horoscope
was derived the term horasastra used for astrology in Sanskrit
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• The decline of the Greek kingdoms in the
north-west coincided with an attack on
Bactria itself by nomadic tribes from
central Asia.
• These tribes included the Scythians, who
were primarily responsible for destroying
Bactrian power.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• The pressure of the consolidated Chinese empire
under Shi Huang Ti, who built the Great Wall, as
well as the drying up of their pastures drove
central Asian nomadic tribes including the Yuechis
westward.
• Pressed from the north and east, the Scythians
attacked Bactria and occupied it.
• Close on their heels were the Yuechis. Therefore
the Scythians, known in the Indian sources as
Shakas, moved from Bactria and invaded Iran and
then the Greek kingdoms in India.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• By the middle of the first century B.C. only a few Greek chiefs ruled
in India, and the Shaka power extended as far interior into the
country as Mathura.
• There were five branches of the Shakas with their seats of power in
different parts of India and Afghanistan.
• One branch settled in Afghanistan.
• The second branch settled in Punjab with Taxila as its capital.
• The third branch settled in Mathura.
• The fourth branch established its hold over western India
• The fifth branch of the Shakas established its power in the upper
Deccan.
• The first Shaka king in India was Maues or Moga (C. 80 B.C.), who
established Shaka power in Gandhara.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Maues issued a large number of coins mostly in copper, and a few in silver.
• Maues adopted the title Maharaja Mahatma, the great king of kings, an
exact Prakrit translation of the title Basileos Megalou adopted by several
Indo-Greek kings.
• His rule extended on both sides of the Indus, from Pushkalavati on the on
the west to Taxila on the east.
• Numismatic evidence suggests that Maues was succeeded by Azes I who
was followed by Azilises and Azes II.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Azilises introduced coins with a typical Indian diety, Abhishekha –
Lakhshmi.
• After Azes II the Saka territory passed into the hands of Gondophernes, a
Parthian.
• Most famous Shaka ruler in India was Rudradaman 1 who ruled not only
Sindh but also considerable part of Gujrat, Konkan, Malwa & Kathiawar.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Rudradaman 1 is famous in history for his repair work of Sudarshana lake
at Kathiawar ( 1
st ever Sanskrit inscription)
• Rudradaman I was succeeded by seven weak rulers.
• The last known ruler Rudrasimha III, who ruled upto A.D. 388, has been
mentioned in Banabhatt’s Harshacharita as having been killed by the
Gupta monarch, Chandragupta II.
• The Guptas then annexed the Saka territories.
Shaka ruler or Scythian
• Around 57 B.C, we hear of a king of Ujjain who fought effectively against
Shakas & emerged victorious, He called himself ‘Vikramaditya’, by whose
name an era Vikram Samvat is reckoned. Henceforth, vikramaditya
became a coveted title & whosoever achieved anything great adopted this
title.
The Parthians
• Parthians (Iranians) overthrew Shakas from Taxila around
1
st century
• The Shaka domination in the north-western India was followed
by that of the Parthians, and in many ancient Indian Sanskrit
texts the two peoples are together mentioned as ShakaPahlavas.
• In fact they ruled over this country on parallel lines for some
time. Originally the Pathians lived in Iran from where they
moved to India. In comparison with the Greeks and the Shakas,
they occupied only a small portion of north-western India in the
first century.
• Most famous Parthian king was Gondopherens, in whose reign
St. Thomas is said to have visited India for propagation of
Christianity.
Kushanas
• Branch of Yeuchis or Tocharians tribe from north central Asia
basically from neighbourhood of China
• They 1
st occupied Bactria or North Afghanistan, displacing
Shakas & then gradually moved upto Kabul valley & seized
Gandhara by crossing Hindukush range, replacing rule of Greeks
& Parthians from these areas.
• Finally they setup their authority over lower Indus basin &
Greater part of Ganga basin
• Founder of Kushana dynasty was Kadphises 1 who issued coins
in Kabul valley in his name.
Kushanas
• His son Kadphises 2 issued gold coins with high
sounding titles like “ Lord of whole world “ &
spread his kingdom to the east as far as Mathura
• The Kushanas belongs to Yuechi tribe.
• The dynasty was founded by a house of chiefs
who were called Kadphises and who ruled for 28
years from about A.D. 50. and was succeeded by
his son, Vima Kadphises who invaded India and
advanced far into the interior of North India.
Dynasty of Kadphises
• There are good reasons to believe that the Kushana Empire
extended from the Oxus River or even beyond to the
eastern border of Uttar Pradesh.
• Vima Kadphises, however, did not rule over the conquered
territories in person. He appointed a number of Satraps to
govern the different parts of his Indian dominion.
• Vima issued gold coins which show a considerable Indian
influence.
• All his coins, shows unmistakable signs of his Saiva
affiliation.
• The abundance of gold and copper coins issued by Vima
Kadphises indicated the prosperity of the Kushana Empire.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• The house of Kadphises was succeeded by that of
Kanishka.
• Kanishka started an era in 78 A.D. which is now known as
the Saka era and is used by the Government of India.
• Under Kanishka, the Kushana Empire reached the height of
its power and became a mighty force in the world of its
clay.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• In India his suzerainty extended as far south as
Sanchi and as Far East as Banaras.
• In Central Asia his dominions were extensive.
Purushapura (Peshawar) was his capital and
Mathura was the second most important city of the
empire.
• Kanishka is often remembered for his association
with Buddhism. Himself a Buddhist convert, he
convened the fourth Buddhist Council in Kashmir
where the doctrines of the Mahayana form of
Buddhism were finalized.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• He encouraged missionary activities and Buddhist
missions were sent to central Asia and China.
• Kanishka was a great patron of arts and letters. The
age of Kanishka witnessed the execution of the best
work in Gandhara style.
• He is said to have constructed at Peshawar a
multistoreyed relic tower enshrining the relic of the
Buddha under the supervision of a Greek engineer
Agesilaos.
• The Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang, who came to India
in the seventh century, gives a detailed account of
the stupa.
Dynasty of Kanishka
• Kanishka built a tower near Taxila and the city of Kanishkapura in Kashmir probably
owed its foundation to him.
• Several Buddhist theologians are associated with Kanishka – Ashvaghosha,
Vasumitra, Parshva, Sangaraksha, Dharmatrata and Matricheta. Nagarjuna was the
great exponent of Mahayana doctrine.
• He also patronised famous physician of Indian history Charka who wrote “
Charaksamhita” or sasruta
Dynasty of Kanishka
• Last important Kushana ruler was Vasudeva who was worshipper of Shiva.
• He extended Kushana empire upto lower Indus basin (Malwa) & eastward
till Magadha in India & setup his capital at Peshawar (Purushaputra)
• Kanishka issued a high number of gold coins with high purity & embraced
Buddhism whole heartedly.
• Kanishka is traditionally believed to have died fighting in central Asia.
Successors of Kanishka I
• Kanishka’s rule lasted for twenty-three years. His immediate successor was
Vasishka, who had a short reign and was succeeded by Huvishka.
• The empire of Huvishka was not less extensive than that of Kanishka. It
may have spread further to the west, as a record of his reign has been
unearthed at Wardak to the west of Kabul.
Successors of Kanishka I
• Mathura was now a great centre of Kushana power and it was adorned
with monuments by Huvishka ruled simultaneously with Vasishka II or
Vajheska and with the latter’s son Kanishka II.
• Kanishka II received in addition to the titles of great king, the king of kings,
son of heaven (devaputra)assumed by his predecessors.
• Huvishka’s abundant coinage, which is more variable than that of
Kanishka, presents fine portraits of the king.
Successors of Kanishka I
• The varied reverse devices of his coins, like Kanishka’s coins, contains the figures of
different deities such as Skandakumara, Visakha, Mahasena and Uma, the
Alexandrian Serapis, the Greek Heracles and several Zoroastrian deities.
• The absence of the Buddha on his coins leads to the inference that Huvishka was
well-disposed towards Brahmanism.
• The last great Kushana king was Vasudeva I, who ruled from about the year 67 to
98 of the Kanishka era. Most of his inscriptions have been found at or near
Mathura, and his coins usually bear the god Siva and rarely any Iranian deity.
• The decline of the Kushana power in the northwest was hastened by the rise of the Sassanian
dynasty of Persia in the third century A.D.
• One of the causes of the downfall of the Kushanas
was the rise of independent republics like the
Yaudheyas, Kunindas and Malavas in the beginning
of the third century A.D. who partitioned among
themselves territories formerly held by the
Kushanas.
• The rule of the Kushanas in parts of the Yamuna
valley seems to have been supplanted by that of
the Nagas.
Growth of Urban Centers
• During this period, there is seen a growth of urban centres because this
phase registered a distinct advance in building activities.
• We find the use of burnt bricks for flooring and roofing, construction of
brick kilns, use of script files, and use of red pottery.
Economy and Coinage
• This age of foreign rule had the best impact on
Indian trade and commerce. Unlike other ages of
foreign rule, Sakas and Kushans introduced better
cavalry, use of reins, toe stirrups, turban, tunic,
trousers and heavy long coat. India received a
good deal of gold from Altai Mountains in central
Asia.
• The Kushans controlled the silk route which
started from China and passed through their
empire in central Asia and with the help of tolls
levied from the traders, Kushans built a large
empire. It is significant that the Kushans were the
first rulers in India to issue gold coins on a wide
scale.
Development of Religion
• Some of the foreign rulers were converted to vaishanavism.
• The Greek ambassador Heliodoros set up a pillar in honour of Vishnu near
Vidisa in Madhya Pradesh.
• The famous Greek ruler Menander was converted to Buddhism.
• The Kushan rulers worshipped both Shiva, and Buddha and the images of
these two gods appeared on the Kushan coins.
Political Life and Administration
• The Kushans and the Saka rulers assumed the title of ‘Devputra’ or the son
of God.
• They thus strengthened the concept of the divine origin of kingship.
• The Kushans defeated several of the Indian rulers but restored the
kingdoms if they acknowledged their over-lordships.
• It was the beginning of the feudal system in India.
Political Life and Administration
• The Kushan Empire was divided into smaller units which were governed by
the Kshatraps or Satraps.
• It was the beginning of the Kshatrapa system.
• They also started the curious practice of hereditary dual rule when both
father and the son ruled the same kingdom at the same time.
• This practice of military governorship was also started during this period
as these military governors were quite necessary to control the rebellious
people.
Social Life-New Elements in Indian Social Life
• The Bactrian’s, the Parthians, the Sakas and the Kushans came into India
and settled there permanently, thus becoming an integral part of the
Indian society.
• Thus they lost their separate social identity and they became completely
Indianized.
• Being brave and bold conquerors, they were admitted into the Indian
social system as member of the Kshatriya caste.
Religious Life
• Ist time Idol worship started in India.
• The goal of life also was changed from ‘Nirvana’ to the attainment of ‘Swarga’ or
heaven.
• The old language Pali was also discarded in favour of the Sanskrit and faith took
the place of logic.
• As a result of these changes, the Buddhism gained immense popularity and it
spread not only in India but also in several foreign countries like China, Japan,
Tibet and Central Asia.
Coinage
• Before the Greeks, the Indian coins were
rough and punch-marked.
• The Indians learnt from the Greeks the
art of moulding coins and they now
struck beautiful coins bearing
inscriptions on both the sides.
• The gold coins of Kanishka were also
beautiful and attractive with artistic
images of Gods and Goddesses on them.
The Gandhara School of Art
• Before the Kushans, the Gandhara School of
Art was developed as a result of interaction
between the Greeks and the Indians.
• But during the Kushan rule, the Gandhara
Art reached its zenith.
• This art had developed on the north-western
regions of India known as Gandhara.
• It was therefore called the Gandhara School
of Art or the Indo-Greek Art.
• The Gandhara artists built beautiful largesize images of the Buddha, Budhisatvas and
the Kushan rulers.
The Gandhara School of Art
• They depicted scenes from the life of the Buddha on stone. Most of the specimens
of the Ghandara Art relating to this period are executed in stone.
• But some of the specimens founded at Taxila are in stucco (lime), cement,
terracota (baked clay) and clay.
• The Gandhara Art greatly influenced other schools of Indian sculpture.
• The Greek influence is discernible even in the field of temple and palace
architecture.
• The Indians also learnt the art of cutting rock caves. In Maharashtra, there are
several rock-cut caves.
Literature and Learning
• The foreign rulers patronised Sanskrit and consequently the Sanskrit scholars
wrote several books of great quality.
• The Kushan rules were great lovers of knowledge and they patronised several
scholars which led to the creation of high quality Sanskrit literature particularly,
during the reign of Kanishka.
• Among the notable Sanskrit scholars of this period were Asvaghosha, Vasumitra
(chairman of 4
th Buddhist council), and Nagarjuna(wrote Madhyamik sutra and
gave the concept of Relativity so considered as Indian Einstein).
Literature and Learning
• Asvaghosha wrote the ‘Buddha Charita’, (and is considered as Ramayana of
Buddhist), Vatsyayana wrote Kamasutra. ‘Saundrananda’and ‘Sahputra’.
• Vasumitra wrote ‘Prajnaparmita’, ‘Sutra Shastra’ and ‘Mahavibhasha’.
• The use of curtain, which is called ‘Yavanika’ in Sanskrit, was started.
Science and Technology
• The Indians learnt a lot from the Greeks in the fields of astronomy and
astrology.
• They also learnt from the Kushans, the art of making leather shoes and
articles of glass.
• The Kushan coins were an imitation of the Roman coins.
Botany and Medicine
• Charka, the great Indian physician of this time, wrote ‘Charka Samhita’
which deals with various diseases and the effective herbs (aushadhis) to
cure them.

Foreign Trade and
Balance of Payment
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Definition and Components
• Balance of Payment (BOP) of a country can be defined as a systematic
statement of all economic transactions of a country with the rest of the
world during a specific period usually one year.

Definition and Components
• The Balance of Payments (BOP) is the method countries use to monitor all
international monetary transactions at a specific period of time.
• Usually, the BOP is calculated every quarter and every calendar year.
• All trades conducted by both the private and public sectors are accounted
for in the BOP in order to determine how much money is going in and out
of a country.
• Theoretically, the BOP should be zero, meaning that assets (credits) and
liabilities (debits) should balance.
Purposes of calculation of BOP
• 1. The basic purpose of BOP accounting is to know the strength and
weaknesses of the Economy in international relations.
• 2. By analyzing the BOP accounts of the last year one can come to know
the overall gains and losses from international trade.
• 3. BOP statements give warning signals for future policy formation.
• For preparing a BOP accounts, economic transactions between a
country and rest of the world are grouped under two broad
categories:
 A. Current Account
 B. Capital Account
 C. Financial Account
A. Current Account
• The BOT is typically the biggest bulk of a country's balance of payments as it
makes up total imports and exports.
• If a country has a balance of trade deficit, it imports more than it exports, and
if it has a balance of trade surplus, it exports more than it imports.
• Receipts from income-generating assets such as stocks (in the form of
dividends) are also recorded in the current account.
• The last component of the current account is unilateral transfers.
• These are credits that are mostly worker's remittances, which are salaries sent
back into the home country of a national working abroad, as well as foreign
aids that are directly received.
B. Capital Account
• Inflow and outflow of capital including foreign investment, gold and
foreign exchange reserves. This is of stock nature.
• The capital account is where all international capital transfers are
recorded.
• This refers to the acquisition or disposal of non-financial assets (for
example, a physical asset such as land) and non-produced assets, which
are needed for production but have not been produced, like a mine used
for the extraction of diamonds.
C. The Financial Account
• In the financial account, international monetary flows related to
investment in business, real estate, bonds and stocks are documented.
• Also included are government-owned assets such as foreign reserves,
gold, special drawing rights (SDRs) held with the International Monetary
Fund, private assets held abroad, and direct foreign investment.
• Assets owned by foreigners, private and official, are also recorded in the
financial account.
Convertibility of Rupee
• For the first time, the Union Budget for 1992-93 has made the Indian
rupee partially convertible.
• In order to face the serious current account deficit in the balance of
payments, the Government of India introduced the partial convertibility
of rupee from March 1. 1992.
• Under this system, which remained in operation for a period of one year,
60 per cent of the exchange earnings were convertible in rupees at market
determined exchange rate and the remaining 40 per cent earnings were
convertible in rupees at the officially determined exchange rate.
Convertibility of Rupee
• The term convertibility of a currency indicates that it can be freely
converted into any other currency.
• Convertibility can also be identified as the removal of quantitative
restrictions on trade and payments on current account.
• Convertibility establishes a system where the market place determines the
rate of exchange through the free interplay of demand and supply forces.
Current Account Convertibility
• Current account convertibility relates to the removal of restrictions on payments
relating to the international exchange of goods, services and factor incomes, while
capital account convertibility refers to a similar liberalization of a country’s capital
transactions such as loans and investment, both short term and long term.
• Current account convertibility has been defined as the freedom to buy or sell
foreign exchange for the following international transactions:
 (a) All payments due in connection with foreign trade, other current business,
including services and normal short term banking and credit facilities;
 (b) Payments due as interest on loans and as net income from other
investments;
 C) Moderate remittances for family living expenses.
Capital Account Convertibility
• Capital account convertibility refers to a liberalization of a country’s capital transactions
such as loans and investment, both short term and long term as well as speculative
capital flows.
• In a way, capital account convertibility removes all the restrains on international flows on
India’s capital account.
• There is a basic difference between current account convertibility and capital account
convertibility.
• In the case of current account convertibility, it is important to have a transaction –
importing and exporting of goods, buying and selling of services, inward or outward
remittances, etc. involving payment or receipt of one currency against another currency.
• In the case of capital account convertibility, a currency can be converted into any other
currency without any transaction.
Capital Account Convertibility
• With the growing strength of balance of payments in the post-1991 period
and with external sector remaining robust and gaining strength every year
RBI, in pursuance of the announcement the Prime Minister constituted a
committee on March 20, 2006 with Mr. S.S. Tarapore as its chairman for
setting out a roadways towards fuller capital account convertibility.
• The committee submitted its Report to the RBI on July 31, 2006.
Advantages of Currency Convertibility
• Export promotion
• Incentive to Import Substitution
• Incentive to send remittances from abroad : it makes illegal remittance
such ‘hawala money’ and smuggling of gold less attractive.
• Integration of World Economy
Preconditions for Capital Account Convertibility
• The Tarapore Committee recommended that, before adopting capital
account convertibility (CAC), India should fulfill three crucial preconditions:
 Fiscal deficit should be reduced to 2% per cent of GDP.
 The Governments should fix the annual inflation target below 4 per
cent.
 The Indian financial sector should be strengthened. For this, interest
rates should be deregulated.
Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20
• Commerce and Industry Minister unveiled foreign trade policy (FTP) 2015 -20,
which seek to provide higher incentive to agriculture industry.
• FTP also seeks to establish an institutional framework to work with state
governments to boost India’s exports.
• Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) and Service Exports from India
Scheme (SEIS) launched.
• The 'Services Exports from India Scheme' (SEIS) is for increasing exports of
notified services.
• These schemes (MEIS and SEIS) replace multiple schemes earlier in place.
• E-Commerce of handicrafts, handlooms, books etc., eligible for benefits of MEIS.
India’s Foreign Trade Policy
• Export obligation would be reduced by 25 per cent and incentives
available under the MEIS and SEIS would be extend to the units in the SEZs
to make them more attractive for investors.
• Further business services, hotel and restaurants would get rewards under
SEIS at the rate of 3 per cent and other specified services at the rate of 5
per cent.
• Export obligation reduced to 75% to promote domestic capital goods
manufacturing.
• FTP to be aligned to 'Make in India', 'Digital India' and 'Skills
India' initiatives.
India’s Foreign Trade Policy
• Agriculture and village industry products to be supported across the globe
at rates of 3% and 5% under MEIS.
• Industrial products to be supported in major markets at rates ranging from
2% to 3%.
• Two institutional mechanisms i.e. the board of trade will have an advisory
role, the council for trade development would have representation from
states and UT governments.
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1973
• Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) was promulgated in 1973 and it
came into force on January 1, 1974.
• According to the Section, all non-banking foreign branches and
subsidiaries with foreign equity exceeding 40 per cent had to obtain
permission to establish new undertakings, to purchase shares in existing
companies, or to acquire wholly or partly any other company.
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act
(FERA), 1973
• According to these guidelines, the principal rule was that all branches of
foreign companies operating in India should convert themselves into
Indian companies with at least 60 per cent local equity participation.
• Furthermore all subsidiaries of foreign should bring down the foreign
equity share to 40% or less.
• The actual impact of this act was completely negative on the economic
development of the country, because it tied the hands of big corporate
houses to expand their business, so it was felt by the policy makers that
there should be some relaxation in the act so that the economic
development through industrialization can be speed up in the country.
Foreign Exchange Management Act
(Fema), 1999
• The Foreign Exchange Management Bill (FEMA) was introduced by the
Government of India in Parliament on August 4, 1998.
• The Bill aims "to consolidate and amend the law relating to foreign
exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments
and for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign
exchange market in India.
Features of the FEMA
• a. It is consistent with fully current account convertibility and contains
provisions for progressive liberalization of capital account transactions.
• b. It classified the foreign exchange transactions in two categories, viz. capital
account and current account transactions.
• c. It gives full freedom to a person resident in India, who was earlier resident
outside India, to hold/own/transfer any foreign security/immovable property
situated outside India and acquired when s/he was resident.
• d. FEMA does not apply to Indian citizen’s resident outside India.
Exchange Rate Management in India
• Exchange rate is simply value of a currency in terms of another currency.
• The major functions of the foreign exchange include:
 I. Transferring currency from one market to other where it is needed in the
transactions.
 II. Providing short-term credit to the importers, and thereby facilitating the
smooth flow of goods and services between the countries.
 III. Stabilizing the foreign exchange rate market.
Exchange Management
• Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System: The Finance Minister
announced the liberalised exchange rate management system (LERMS) in
the Budget for 1992- 93.
• This system introduced partial convertibility of rupee.
• Under this system, a dual exchange rate was fixed under which 40 per cent
of foreign exchange earnings were to be surrendered at the official
exchange rate while the remaining 60 per cent were to be converted at a
market-determined rate.
Types of exchange rate management
A. Fixed Exchange Rate B. Flexible Exchange Rate
A. The Fixed Exchange Rate
• When the exchange rate between the domestic and foreign currencies is fixed
by the monetary authority of a country and is not allowed to fluctuate beyond
a limit, it is called fixed exchange rate.
• The basic purpose of adopting fixed exchange rate system is to ensure stability
in foreign trade and capital movements.
• Under fixed exchange rate system, the government assumes the responsibility
of ensuring stability of exchange rate. To this end, the government undertakes
to buy and sell the foreign currency.
• Buy when it becomes weaker and sell when it gets stronger.
• In practice, however, most countries adopt a dual system: a fixed exchange
rate for all official transactions and a market rate for private transactions.
B. Flexible Exchange Rate
• When the exchange rate is decided by the market force (demand and supply of
currency), it is called the flexible exchange rate.
• It is often argued that flexible exchange rate causes destabilization, uncertainty,
risk and speculation.
• It provides a good deal of autonomy in respect of domestic policies as it does
not require any obligatory constraints.
• This advantage is of great significance in the formulation of domestic economic
policies.
• It is self-adjusting and therefore it does not devolve on the government to
maintain an adequate foreign exchange reserves to stabilize the exchange rate.
• It creates conditions for certainty and stability.
SEZ: Special Economic Zone
• It is a specifically demarcated area of India which is deemed as foreign territory for the
purpose of Tax laws and Trade laws.
• Thus, they’re exempted from taxes and are subjected to lower rate of taxes of Union and
State Govts.
• They get single window clearance for various import / export licenses / permissions etc.
• Government will bear the cost of developing the roads, sewage and infrastructure within the
SEZ.
• They are regulated under SEZ policy (2000) and Special Economic Zone Act, 2005.
• 1965: Asia's first SEZ was set up in Kandla, Gujarat.
• Currently we’ve 220+ SEZ in India.
• Benefit: More exports, employment, economic growth.
Foreign Portfolio Investors: FPI
• It is a foreign entity registered with SEBI, and who buys upto 10 percent in equity / shares of

FUNDAMENTAL
RIGHTS
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

 Introduction
• The Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution from
Articles 12 to 35.
• The framers of the Constitution derived inspiration from the Constitution of
USA (i.e., Bill of Rights).
• Part III of the Constitution is rightly described as the Magna Carta of India.
• It contains a very long and comprehensive list of ‘justiciable’ Fundamental
Rights.
• The Fundamental Rights are guaranteed by the Constitution to all persons
without any discrimination. **
• They uphold the equality of all individuals, the dignity of the individual, the
larger public interest and unity of the nation.
©StudyIQ Education
• In the original Constitution 7 Fundamental Rights are mentioned
1. Right to equality (Articles 14–18)
2 .Right to freedom (Articles 19–22)
3. Right against exploitation (Articles 23–24)
4. Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25–28)
5. Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29–30)
6. Right to property (Article 31)
7. Right to constitutional remedies (Article 32)
• The right to property was deleted from the list of Fundamental Rights by the 44th
Amendment Act, 1978.
• It is made a legal right under Article 300-A in Part XII of the Constitution. So at present,
there are only six types of Fundamental Rights.
©StudyIQ Education
Fundamental Rights
©StudyIQ Education
©StudyIQ Education
• Some of them are available only to the citizens while others are available to
all.
• The state can impose reasonable restrictions on them.
• However, whether such restrictions are reasonable or not is to be decided by
the courts.
• They are justiciable, allowing persons to move the courts for their
enforcement, if and when they are violated.
• They can be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency except
the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21.
• Further, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be suspended only when
emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external aggression (i.e.,
external emergency) and not on the ground of armed rebellion (i.e., internal
emergency).
©StudyIQ Education
Features of the Fundamental Rights:
• They can be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency except
the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21.
• Further, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be suspended only when
emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external aggression (i.e.,
external emergency) and not on the ground of armed rebellion (i.e., internal
emergency).
©StudyIQ Education
©StudyIQ Education
• Their scope of operation is limited by
 Article 31A (saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates, etc.),
 Article 31B (validation of certain acts and regulations included in the 9th
Schedule)
 Article 31C (saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles).
• Their application to the members of armed forces, para-military forces, police
forces, intelligence agencies and analogous services can be restricted or
abrogated by the Parliament (Article 33).
©StudyIQ Education
• Their application can be restricted while martial law is in force in any area.
(Note: Martial law means ‘military rule’ imposed under abnormal circumstances
to restore order (Article 34). It is different from the imposition of national
emergency.)
• Most of them are directly enforceable (self-executory) while a few of them
can be enforced on the basis of a law made for giving effect to them.
©StudyIQ Education
Article 12 has defined the term ‘STATE’ for the purposes of Part III.
According to it, the State includes the following:
(a)Government and Parliament of India, that is, executive and legislative organs of the
Union government.
(b) Government and legislature of states, that is, executive and legislative organs of state
government.
(c) All local authorities, that is, municipalities, panchayats, district boards, improvement
trusts, etc.
(d) All other authorities, that is, statutory or non-statutory authorities like LIC, ONGC,
SAIL, etc.
*Note:
According to the Supreme Court, even a private body or an agency working as an
instrument of the State falls within the meaning of the ‘State’ under Article 12.
©StudyIQ Education
Article 12
• Article 13 declares that all laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of
any of the fundamental rights shall be void.
• In other words, it expressively provides for the doctrine of judicial review.
• This power has been conferred on the Supreme Court (Article 32) and the
high courts (Article 226) that can declare a law unconstitutional and invalid on
the ground of contravention of any of the Fundamental Rights.
*Note:
The words Judicial Review are not mentioned in the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Article 13
• Article 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the
law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.

Article 18: Abolition of Titles
Note:
In 1996, the Supreme Court , in Balaji Raghavan vs. Union of India
upheld the constitutional validity of the National Awards—Bharat Ratna, Padma
Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padma Sri.
It ruled that these awards do not amount to ‘titles’ within the meaning of Article
18 that prohibits only hereditary titles of nobility.
However, it also ruled that they should not be used as suffixes or prefixes to the
names of awardees. Otherwise, they should forfeit the awards.
**In December 2013 the High Court of Andhra Pradesh ordered two cinema
personalities Mohan Babu and Bramhanandam to surrender ‘Padma Sri’ to the
President.
©StudyIQ Education
These National Awards were instituted in 1954.
The Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai discontinued
them in 1977.
But they were again revived in 1980 by the Indira Gandhi government.
©StudyIQ Education

• This right is available to both citizens and non-citizens.
• It also ruled that the expression ‘Personal Liberty’ in Article 21 is of the

*Note: This was present in article 45 of the Constitution (DPSP).
Through 86th Amendment act 2002, it was made a fundamental right.
This came into force on April, 2010.
Also added Fundamental duty 51 A (k)
Article 21 A: Right to Education
Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or detained.
Detention is of two types
1. Punitive detention is to punish a person for an offence committed by him after trial
and conviction in a court.
2. Preventive detention ,means detention of a person without trial and conviction by
a court.
Its purpose is not to punish a person for a past offence but to prevent him from
committing an offence in the near future. Thus, preventive detention is only a
precautionary measure and based on suspicion
Article 22: Protection Against Arrest and Detention.
• The Article 22 has two parts—the first part deals with the cases of ordinary law and the
second part deals with the cases of preventive detention law.
(a) The first part of Article 22 confers the following rights on a person who is arrested
or detained under an ordinary law (punitive):
(i) Right to be informed of the grounds of arrest.
(ii) Right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner.
(iii) Right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours, excluding the journey time
(iv) Right to be released after 24 hours unless the magistrate authorises further
detention.
These safeguards are not available to an alien or a person arrested or detained under a
preventive detention law.
(b) The second part of Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or
detained under a preventive detention law.
(i) The detention of a person cannot exceed three months unless an advisory board
reports sufficient cause for extended detention. The board is to consist of judges
of a high court.
This protection is available to both citizens as well as aliens
Article 22 also authorises the Parliament to prescribe
(a) the circumstances and the classes of cases in which a person can be detained for
more than three months under a preventive detention law without obtaining the
opinion of an advisory board;
(b) the maximum period for which a person can be detained in any classes of cases
under a preventive detention law; and
(c) the procedure to be followed by an advisory board in an inquiry.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 has reduced the period of detention without
obtaining the opinion of an advisory board from three to two months. However,
this provision has not yet been brought into force, hence, the original period of
three months still continues.
• Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings, begar (forced labour) and other
similar forms of forced labour.
• Any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in
accordance with law.
• This right is available to both citizens and non-citizens.
• It protects the individual not only against the State but also against private
persons.
Article 23: Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced
Labour
• Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in
any factory, mine or other hazardous activities like construction work or
railway.
• But it does not prohibit their employment in any harmless or innocent work.
In 2006, the government banned the employment of children as domestic
servants or workers in business establishments like hotels, dhabas, restaurants,
shops, factories, resorts, spas, tea-shops and so on.
Anyone employing children below 14 years of age would be liable for prosecution
and penal action.
Article 24: Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories
Child Labour Amendment (2016)
• The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, amended
the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986.
• It has renamed the Principal Act as the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition
and Regulation) Act, 1986.
• The Amendment Act prohibits the employment of children below
14 years in all occupations and processes.
• Earlier, this prohibition was applicable to 18 occupations and 65 processes.
• Further, the Amendment Act prohibits the employment of adolescents (14
to 18 years of age) in certain hazardous occupations and processes.
• The Amendment Act also introduces more stringent punishment for the
offenders. It is an imprisonment of 6 months to 2 years, or a fine of 20,000
to 50,000, or both.
• In case of repeated offences, the imprisonment is of 1 year to 3 years
• All persons are equally entitled to:
(a) Freedom of conscience: Inner freedom of an individual to mould his
relation with God or Creatures in whatever way he desires.
(b) Right to profess: Declaration of one’s religious beliefs and faith openly
and freely.
(c) Right to practice: Performance of religious worship, rituals, ceremonies
and exhibition of beliefs and ideas.
(d) Right to propagate: Transmission and dissemination of one’s religious
beliefs to others or exposition of the tenets of one’s religion.
Article 25: Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and
Propagation of Religion
• But, it does not include a right to convert another person to one’s own
religion. Forcible conversions impinge on the ‘freedom of conscience’
guaranteed to all the persons alike.
• Available to all persons—citizens as well as non-citizens.
• According to Article 26, every religious denomination or any of its section
shall have the following rights:
(a)Right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable
purposes;
(b)Right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;
(c)Right to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and
(d)Right to administer such property in accordance with law.
Article 26: Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs
Article 25 guarantees rights of individuals,
Article 26 guarantees rights of religious denominations or their sections.
In other words, Article 26 protects collective freedom of religion.
Like the rights under Article 25, the rights under Article 26 are also subject to
public order, morality and health but not subject to other provisions
relating to the Fundamental Rights.
• Article 27 lays down that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for
the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious
denomination.
• The State should not spend the public money collected by way of tax for the
promotion or maintenance of any particular religion.
• This provision prohibits the State from favouring, patronising and supporting
one religion over the other.
• This means that the taxes can be used for the promotion or maintenance of
all religions.
Article 27: Freedom from Taxation for Promotion of a Religion
• Under Article 28, no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational
institution wholly maintained out of State funds.
• However, this provision shall not apply to an educational institution
administered by the State but established under any endowment or trust,
requiring imparting of religious instruction in such institution.
Article 28: Freedom from Attending Religious Instruction.
Article 28 distinguishes between four types of educational institutions:
(a) Institutions wholly maintained by the State.
(b) Institutions administered by the State but established under any
endowment/trust.
(c) Institutions recognised by the State.
(d) Institutions receiving aid from the State.
(a)- religious instruction is completely prohibited
(b) - religious instruction is permitted.
(c), (d) - religious instruction is permitted on a voluntary basis.
• Article 29 provides that any section of the citizens residing in any part of India
having a distinct language, script or culture of its own, shall have the right to
conserve the same.
• No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution
maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of
religion, race, caste, or language.
Article 29: Protection of Interests of Minorities
• Article 29 grants protection to both religious minorities as well as linguistic
minorities.
• However, the Supreme Court held that the scope of this article is not
necessarily restricted to minorities only, as it is commonly assumed to be.
• This is because of the use of words ‘section of citizens’ in the Article that
include minorities as well as majority.
Article 30 grants the following rights to minorities, whether religious or linguistic:
(a) All minorities shall have the right to establish and administer educational
institutions of their choice.
(b) The compensation amount fixed by the State for the compulsory acquisition
of any property of a minority educational institution shall not restrict or abrogate
the right guaranteed to them.
(c) In granting aid, the State shall not discriminate against any educational
institution managed by a minority.
Article 30: Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer
Educational Institution
• The right under Article 30 also includes the right of a minority to impart
education to its children in its own language.
• The protection under Article 30 is confined only to minorities (religious or
linguistic) and does not extend to any section of citizens (as under Article
29).
** The term ‘minority’ has not been defined anywhere in the Constitution.
• A mere declaration of fundamental rights in the Constitution is meaningless,
useless and worthless without providing an effective machinery for their
enforcement, if and when they are violated.
• Hence, Article 32 confers the right to remedies for the enforcement of the
fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen.
• the right to get the Fundamental Rights protected is in itself a fundamental
right. This makes the fundamental rights real. That is why Dr Ambedkar called
Article 32 as the most important article of the Constitution—‘an Article
without which this constitution would be a nullity. It is the very soul of the
Constitution and the very heart of it’.
• The Supreme Court has ruled that Article 32 is a basic feature of the
Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)
• A writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or
judicial jurisdiction.
• In India,
 the Supreme Court (under Article 32) and the
 high courts (under Article 226)
can issue the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and
quo-warranto.
• These writs are borrowed from English law.
©StudyIQ Education
What is a ‘WRIT’ ?
The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court differs from that of a high court in three
respects:
1. The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental
rights whereas a high court can issue writs not only for the enforcement of
Fundamental Rights but also for any other purpose (legal rights)
 HC scope >> SC scope
2. SC jurisdiction >> HC jurisdiction
3. Supreme Court may not refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction.
 a remedy under Article 226 is discretionary and hence, a high court may refuse to
exercise its writ jurisdiction.
The Supreme Court is constituted as a defender and guarantor of the fundamental
rights.

(a) against a private individual or body; (b) against the president of India or the state governors; and
(c) against the chief justice of a high court acting in judicial capacity.
©StudyIQ Education
• Literally, it means ‘to forbid’.
• It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent the latter
from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a jurisdiction that it does not
possess.
• Thus, unlike mandamus that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity.
• The writ of prohibition can be issued only against judicial and quasi-judicial
authorities.
• It is not available against administrative authorities, legislative bodies, and
private individuals or bodies.
©StudyIQ Education
Prohibition
• In the literal sense, it means ‘to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’.
• It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a
case pending with the latter to itself or to squash the order of the latter in a
case.
• It is issued on the grounds of excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or
error of law.
• Thus, unlike prohibition, which is only preventive, certiorari is both
preventive as well as curative.
• Previously, the writ of certiorari could be issued only against judicial and
quasi-judicial authorities and not against administrative authorities.
• Like prohibition, certiorari is also not available against legislative bodies and
private individuals or bodies.
©StudyIQ Education
Certiorari
• In the literal sense, it means ‘by what authority or warrant’.
• It is issued by the court to enquire into the legality of claim of a person to a
public office.
• The writ can be issued only in case of a substantive public office of a
permanent character created by a statute or by the Constitution. It cannot be
issued in cases of ministerial office or private office.

Quo-Warranto
• Article 33 empowers the Parliament to restrict or abrogate the fundamental
rights of the members of armed forces, para-military forces, police forces,
intelligence agencies and analogous forces.
• The objective of this provision is to ensure the proper discharge of their
duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.

Armed Forces and Fundamental Rights
Article 33
• Article 34 provides for the restrictions on fundamental rights while martial
law is in force in any area within the territory of India.

Article 34
Martial Law vs. National Emergency
©StudyIQ Education
• Article 35 lays down that the power to make laws, to give effect to certain
specified fundamental rights shall vest only in the Parliament and not in the
state legislatures.
©StudyIQ Education
Article 35
Right to Property
• Originally, the right to property was one of the seven fundamental rights
under Part III of the Constitution.
• Article 19(1)(f) guaranteed to every citizen the right to acquire, hold and
dispose of property.
• Article 31, on the other hand, guaranteed to every person, whether citizen
or non-citizen, right against deprivation of his property.
• It provided that no person shall be deprived of his property except by
authority of law.
©StudyIQ Education
It empowered the State to acquire or requisition the property of a person on two
conditions:
(a) it should be for public purpose, and
(b) it should provide for payment of compensation (amount) to the owner.
©StudyIQ Education
• 44th Amendment Act of 1978 abolished the right to property as a
Fundamental Right by repealing Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31
• Instead, the Act inserted a new Article 300A in Part XII under the heading
‘Right to Property’.
• It provides that no person shall be deprived of his property except by
authority of law.
• Thus, the right to property still remains a legal right or a constitutional
right, though no longer a fundamental right. (it can be changed/modified by
law now)
• It is not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

 He failed as a practicing lawyer both at Rajkot and in Bombay
 In 1893, he proceeded to Natal, South Africa in relation with a case involving his
client, Dada Abdullah.
 In South Africa, he witnessed apartheid (Racial discrimination) to which Asians
who had gone to South Africa as labourers were subjected.
 He decided to stay in South Africa to organise the Indian workers to enable them
to fight for their rights.
 He stayed there till 1914.
 Returned on 9 January 1915
**Pravasi Bharatiya Divas

 Awarded a medal for the service
 The third and final phase of the Nationalist Movement [1917-1947] is known as
the Gandhian era.
 During this period Mahatma Gandhi became the undisputed leader of the
National Movement.
 His principles of non-violence and Satyagraha were employed against the
British Government.
 Gandhi made the nationalist movement a mass movement.
‘Satyagraha’ = passive resistance or civil disobedience
"insistence on truth”
Or
"Truth-force."
Gandhi evolved the technique during his stay in South Africa, which was based on
truth and non-violence. Its basic tenets were —
 A Satyagrahi was not to submit to what he considered as wrong, but was to
always remain truthful, non-violent and fearless.
 A true Satyagrahi would never bow before the evil, whatever the consequence.
 He should be ready to accept suffering in his struggle against the evil doer.
 This suffering was to be a part of his love for truth.
 Even while carrying out his struggle against the evil doer, a true Satyagrahi
would love the evil-doer; hatred would be alien to his nature.
 Only the brave and strong could practise Satyagraha, which was not for the weak
& cowards, even violence was preferred to cowardice.
Champaran Satyagraha (1917)
• First Civil Disobedience Movement (सविनय अिज्ञा)
• Raj Kumar Shukla asked Gandhi to look into the problems of the indigo
planters
• The European planters had been forcing peasants to grow Indigo on 3/20
of the total land (called tinkathia system).
• Towards the end of the 19th century, German synthetic dyes replaced
indigo
• European planters demanded high rents and illegal dues from the peasants.
• Besides, the peasants were forced to sell the produce at prices fixed by the
European.
 When Gandhi reached Champaran to probe into the matter, the authorities
ordered him to leave the area at once.
 Gandhi defied the order and preferred to face the punishment.
 This passive resistance or civil disobedience of an unjust order was a novel
method at that time.
 Finally, the authorities relented and permitted Gandhi to make an enquiry.
 Government appointed a committee to look into the matter and nominated
Gandhi as a member.
 Gandhi was able to convince the authorities that the tinkathia system should be
abolished and the peasants should be compensated for the illegal dues extracted
from them.
 As a compromise with the planters, he agreed that only 25 % of the money taken
should be compensated.
 Within a decade, the planters left the area.
Kheda Satyagraha (1918)
 First Non-Cooperation Movement (असहयोग)
 Because of drought in 1918, crops failed in Kheda district of Gujarat.
 According to Revenue Code, if the yield was less than 1/4
th of the normal
produce, the farmers were entitled to remission.
 The authorities refused to grant remission.
 Gandhi supported the peasants cause and asked them to withhold revenue.
 During the Kheda Satyagraha, many young nationalists such as Sardar Patel and
Indulal Yagnik became Gandhi’s followers.
Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918)
 First Hunger Strike
 Gandhi now intervened in a dispute between mill owners of Ahmedabad and the
workers over the issue of discontinuation of the plague bonus.
 Gandhi asked the workers to go on a strike and demand a 35 % increase in wages.
 The employers were willing to concede a 20 % bonus only.
 Gandhi advised the workers to remain non-violent while on strike.
 He undertook a fast unto death to strengthen the worker’s resolve.
 Mill owners finally agreed to give the workers a 35 % increase in wages.
Satyagraha against Rowlatt Act (First Mass Strike)
Rowlatt Act, 1919
 Passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi on March 18, 1919
 Extension of the Defence of India Act 1915
 Also known as Black Act
 Was mainly aimed to look into the militant Nationalist activities.
 Any person could be arrested on the basis of suspicion.
 They gave enormous powers to the police to search a place and arrest any person
they disapproved of, without warrant.
 No appeal or petition could be filed against such arrests for up to 2 years
 Gandhi organised a Satyagraha Sabha and roped in younger members of Home
Rule Leagues and the Pan Islamists.
 The forms of protest finally chosen included observance of a nationwide
hartal (strike) accompanied by fasting and prayer, and civil disobedience
against specific laws, and courting arrest and imprisonment.
There was a radical change in the national movement by now—
 The masses had found a direction; now they could “act’’ instead of just giving
verbal expression to their grievances.
 From now onwards, peasants, artisans and the urban poor were to play an
increasingly important part in the struggle.
 Orientation of the national movement turned to the masses permanently.
A well known description of the bill at that time was:
 No Dalil, No Vakil, No Appeal
 No pleas, No lawyer, no Appeal.
Gandhi called for a nationwide protest against the draconian law in
Feb 1919.
Jalianwalla Bagh Massacre April 13, 1919
 In Punjab, there was an unprecedented support to the Rowlatt Satyagraha.
 Facing a violent situation and suspected insurrection, Government called in large
number of military troops
 Military was led by Brig. General Dyer.
 General Dyer banned all public meetings and detained the political leaders.
 On Baisakhi day, a large, crowd of people mostly from neighbouring villages,
unaware of the prohibitory orders in the city
 They had gathered in this small park to protest against the arrest of their leaders,
Dr.Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr.Satyapal
 The Army surrounded the gathering under orders from General Dyer
 They blocked the only exit point and opened fire on the unarmed crowd.
 This resulted in nationwide protest against this massacre
 Even London newspapers criticised the Govt for the act
 Rabindranath Tagore renounced his knighthood as a protest.
 Gandhi was overwhelmed by atmosphere of violence and withdrew the Rowlatt
Satyagraha movement on April 18, 1919.
 The British government released figures stating 379 dead and 1,200 wounded.
 Other sources place the number of dead at well over 1,000.
 This "brutality stunned the entire nation“, resulting in a "wrenching loss of
faith" of the general public in the intentions of the UK.
 The ineffective inquiry and the initial accolades for Dyer by the House of Lords
fuelled widespread anger
NOTE --
 The governor of Punjab at the time, Michael O'Dwyer , supported
the massacre.
 He was shot dead by Udham singh, a revolutionary, in London in
1940

Glacial Landforms
& Cycle of Erosion
By Dr Vipan
Goyal

Glacial Landforms and Cycle of Erosion
• A glacier is a moving mass of ice at
speeds averaging few meters a day.
• The permanently ice-covered regions on
the earth surface are called as snowfields. The lowest limit of permanent
snow or snow-field is called as the
snowline.
• A Glacier forms in areas where the
accumulation of snow exceeds its
ablation (melting and sublimation) over
many years.
• They form features like crevasses,
seracs etc.
• A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture,
found in an ice sheet or glacier, as
opposed to a crevice that forms in
rock.
• A serac is a block or column of glacial
ice, often formed by intersecting
crevasses on a glacier.
• Glaciers cover about 10 percent of
Earth’s land surface and they are the
largest freshwater reservoirs on earth.
• Types of Glaciers:
• The continental glaciers are found in
the Antarctica and in Greenland. They
move outward in all directions.
• Ice caps are the covers of snow and
ice on mountains from which the
valley or mountain glaciers originate.
• The piedmont glaciers form a
continuous ice sheet at the base of
mountains as in southern Alaska.
• Valley/Mountain Glaciers: Move from
higher elevation to lower
Glacial Landforms and Cycle of Erosion
• The valley glaciers, also known as Alpine glaciers, are
found in higher regions of the Himalayas in our
country and all such high mountain ranges of the
world.
• The largest of Indian glaciers occur in the Karakoram
range, viz. Siachen (72 km), while Gangotri in Uttar
Pradesh (Himalayas) is 25.5 km long.
• A glacier during its lifetime creates various landforms
which may be classified into erosional and
depositional landforms.
Cirque/Corrie
• They are deep, long and wide troughs
or basins with very steep concave to
vertically dropping high walls at its
head as well as sides.
• They are simply a bowl-shaped
depression formed due to the
erosional activity of glaciers.
• When these depressions are filled
with water, they are called as Cirque
lake or Corrie Lake or Tarn Lakes.
Glacial Trough
• Original stream-cut valley, further
modified by glacial action.
• It is a ‘U’ Shaped Valley with steep
sided and flat bottomed valley. It at
mature stage of valley formation.
• Since glacial mass is heavy and slow
moving, erosional activity is uniform –
horizontally as well as vertically.
Hanging Valley
• They are most commonly associated
with U-shaped valleys when a tributary
glacier flows into a glacier of larger
volume.
• Hanging valleys are typically formed when
the main valley has been widened and
deepened by glacial erosion, leaving the
side valley cut off abruptly from the main
valley below. The steep drop from
the hanging valley to the main valley floor
usually creates cascading waterfalls.
D-Fjord
• A fjord is a very deep glacial trough
filled with sea water and making up
shorelines.
• A fjord is formed when a glacier
cuts a U-shaped valley by ice
segregation and abrasion of the
surrounding bedrock and this valley
gradually gets filled with the
seawater (formed in mountains
near by sea).
• Fjords are common in Norway,
Greenland and New Zealand.
Horns and Aretes
• Horns are sharp pointed and
steep-sided peaks.
• They are formed by headward
erosion of cirque wall.
• When the divide between two
cirque walls gets narrow because
of progressive erosions, it results
in the formation of a saw-toothed
ridge called Arete.
•
Glacial Erosional Landforms
Glacial Depositional Landforms
• Glacial deposits are of two
types:
• Glacial Till :unassorted coarse
and fine debris;
• Outwash :assorted roughly
stratified deposits.
Moraines
• Moraines are rock fragments, gravel, sand, etc.
carried by a glacier.
• When these deposits are at the end of a glacier, they
are called as Terminal moraines and
• when they are deposited on both sides, they are
called as Lateral moraines.
• When lateral moraines of two glaciers join together,
they form Medial moraines.
• When the lateral moraines of both sides of a glacier
join together, it forms a horse-shoe shape.
Esker
 When glaciers melt in summer, the water
which formed as a result of melting
accumulates beneath the glacier and flows
like streams in channels beneath that ice.
 Very coarse material like boulders, blocks
and some minor fractions of rock deposited
in the valleys itself and once the ice melts
completely, they are visible to the surface
as ridges and are called as Eskers.
 The eskers resemble the features of an
embankment and are often used for making
roads.
Glacial Depositional Landforms
• Outwash Plain
 When the glacier reaches its lowest
point and melts, it leaves behind a
stratified deposition material,
consisting of rock debris, clay, sand,
gravel etc. This layered surface is
called till plain or an outwash plain.
• Kame Terraces
 Broken ridges or un-assorted
depositions looking like hump in a
till plain.
Drumlins
• They are smooth oval-shaped
ridge-like structures
composed mainly of glacial
till.
• It shapes like an inverted
spoon with the highest part is
called as Stoss End and the
lowest narrow part is called
as Tail End or lee slope.
Kettle Holes
 Formed when the
deposited material in a
till plain gets depressed
locally and forms a
basin.
Glacial Depositional Landforms
Glacial Cycle of Erosion
• Youth
 The stage is marked by the inward cutting
activity of ice in a cirque.
 Aretes and horns are emerging. The
hanging valleys are not prominent at this
stage.
• Maturity
 Hanging valleys start emerging. The
opposite cirques come closer and the
glacial trough acquires a stepped profile
which is regular and graded.
Glacial Cycle of Erosion
• Old Age
 Emergence of a ‘U’-
shaped valley marks the
beginning of old age.
 An outwash plain with
features such as eskers,
kame terraces, drumlins,
kettle holes etc. is a
prominent development.

Government of India Act
 1935
Government of India Act of 1935 was passed on the basis of –
 the report of the Simon Commission
 the outcome of the Round Table Conferences
 the White Paper issued by the British Government in 1933
Features/Provisions of 1935 Act
 Provision for the establishment of an All India Federation at the Centre,
consisting of the Provinces of British India and the Princely States
 Did not come into existence since the Princely States refused to give their
consent for the union
 Division of powers into three lists –
1. Federal List (59)
2. Provincial List (54)
3. Concurrent List (36)
 Introduction of Diarchy at the Centre
The Governor-General and his councillors administered the “Reserved
subjects”
The Council of Ministers were responsible for the “Transferred” subjects
 Abolition of Diarchy and the introduction of Provincial Autonomy in
the provinces.
 Provincial Legislatures of Bengal, Madras, Bombay, United Provinces,
Bihar and Assam were made bicameral.(6 out of 11)
 The working of the provincial autonomy was not successful.
 The Governors were not bound to accept the advice of the ministers.
 In reality, the real power in the Provincial Government was with the
Governor.
 But, despite these drawbacks in the scheme, the Congress decided to take
part in the elections to the Provincial Legislatures with the consideration
that it was an improvement over the previous Acts.
* Provincial Elections in 1937 – INC swept to power in 7 provinces
 Extension/Continuation of the principle of Separate Electorates to
 Sikhs
 Europeans
 Indian Christians
 Anglo Indians
 Establishment of a Federal Court at Delhi with a Chief Justice and 6
judges.
 Establishment of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the year 1935.
 (Recommended by Hilton-Young Commission)
 Separation of Burma from India

Malwa, the Maukharis of U.P., the Maitrakas in Saurashtra, and others in
Bengal.
• The Gupta Empire was restricted to Magadha only. (Yasodharman had
joined forces with Narasimhagupta to successfully retaliate against the
Hun chief Mihirakula.)
• The later Guptas’ following of Buddhism rather than Hinduism unlike their
ancestors also weakened the empire. They did not focus on empirebuilding and military conquests.
Gupta’s Administration
• Unlike Mauryas, Guptas assumed titles like parmeshwara, Maharajadhiraja
& Paramabhattaraka
• Provinces in Gupta’s period were known as Bhuktis & provincial governors
Uparikas
• King maintained close contacts with provincial administration through a
class of officials called “Kumaramatyas” & “Ayuktas”
• Provinces were divided into districts Vishayas under charge of Vishayapati
• All foreign affairs were looked after by foreign affair minister known as
“Sandivigraha”
Gupta’s Administration
• Villagers were subjected to forced labour called Vishti for serving royal
army & officials
• The royal seal bore the imprint of Garuda.
• Started in the Deccan by the Satavahanas, the practice of granting land
and fiscal administrative concessions the priests and administrators
became regular affairs in the Gupta times.
• A new office of Sandhivigrhaka was created during Samundra Gupta who
was responsible for the peace and war. Harisena held this title.
Art and Architecture during the Gupta Empire
• Gupta age is called golden age of India in field of art, science & literature
• Mural paintings of Ajanta, which mainly depicted life stories of Buddha as
in Jataka stories belong to this period (Paintings at Sigiria in Srilanka are
influenced by Ajanta paintings)
Literature
Sanskrit became primary language in Gupta period
Ramayana & Mahabharata were compiled during this
period

• One new school was added i.e. Sarnath school of
sculpture
• Example : Sultanganj Buddha (7.5 ft in height) –
(Near Bhagalpur in Bihar)
• Buddha images in Sarnath have plain transparent
drapery covering both shoulders.
• Halo around the head has very little ornamentation
Gupta Temple Architecture
Gupta period marks the beginning of Indian temple architecture.
Manuals were written regarding how to form temples.
• Mandapa appears to originate
1
st from here
• Vishnu Varaha temples at Eran (MP)
• Square temple with a squat
tower (shikhara) above;
• Pillared approach, a high
platform at the base
• ladkhan at Aihole (Karnataka)
• paradakshina around the sanctum
• Sometimes a second story is present
• Dasavatara temple (Deogarh, Jhansi)
• “Curvilinear tower” i.e. “Shikhara”.

Bihar
Facts
• Most remarkable was the Bhitari monolithic pillar of Skandagupta.
• Nagara and Dravidian styles of art came during this period.
• There was absence of growth of Gandhara style.
• But Mathura’s one pleasant standing Buddha statue shows a little
Greek style.
• The temple at Deogarh near Jhansi, the sculptures in the temple at
Garhwas (near Allahabad) was great source of showing effects of
the Gupta art.
Facts
• During the Gupta period Metallurgy also made a wonderful impact. The
craftsmen were expert in their art of casting metal statues and pillars.
• The most antique item in Sultanganj/Bihar which is the huge copper
statue of Buddha. This is now kept at Birmingham museum,England was
of seven and a half feet height and a ton weight.
• The Delhi Iron pillar of the Gupta period is rust free even today.
• Chandragupta II and his successors also issued gold, silver and copper
coins.

Harshavardhana
Vakatakas
Chalukyan
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Harshavardhana (606 – 647 AD)
• After Gupta’s decline, Harshavardhana, a ruler of
Thanesar, Haryana extended his authority.
• Harshavardhana was born in 590 AD to King
Prabhakaravardhana of Sthaneshvara (Thanesar,
Haryana).
• He belonged to the Pushyabhuti also called Vardhana
dynasty.
• He was a Hindu who later embraced Mahayana
Buddhism.
• He was married to Durgavati.
Rise to the throne
• After Prabhakaravardhana died, his elder son Rajyavardhana ascended to
the throne of Thanesar.
• Harsha had a sister, Rajyashri who was married to king Grahavarman of
Kannauj.
• Sasanka, the Gauda king killed Grahavarman and kept Rajyashri prisoner.
• This prompted Rajyavardhana to fight against Sasanka. But Sasanka killed
Rajyavardhana.
Rise to the throne
• This led the 16-year old Harshavardhana to ascend the throne of Thanesar
in 606 AD.
• He vowed to avenge his brother’s murder and also rescue his sister.
• For this, he forged an alliance with Bhaskaravarman, the Kamarupa king.
• Harsha and Bhaskaravarman marched against Sasanka.
• Ultimately, Sasanka left for Bengal and Harsha became the king of Kannauj
also.
Annexation of Kannauj
• Harshavardhana made Kannauj his capital & seat of power & became last
great Hindu ruler of North India
• After the fall of the Guptas, North India was divided into many small
kingdoms.
• Harsha was able to unite many of them under his command.
• He had under his control Punjab and central India.
• After Sasanka’s death, he annexed Bengal, Bihar and Odisha.
• He also defeated the Vallabhi king in
Gujarat. (The Vallabhi king and Harsha
came to a truce by a marriage between
Harsha’s daughter and the Vallabhi king
Dhruvabhata.)
• However, Harsha’s plans to conquer lands
to the south were hampered when the
Chalukya king, Pulakesin II defeated
Harsha in 618-619 A.D.
• This sealed Harsha’s southern territorial
limit as the Narmada River.
• There were two types of territories under Harsha.
• One was directly under him and the other type was those that were feudatories.
 Direct territories: Central Provinces, Bengal, Kalinga, Rajputana, Gujarat
 Feudatories: Jalandhar, Kashmir, Kamarupa, Sind, Nepal
• Even the feudatories were under the tight command of Harsha.
• Hiuen Tsang visited India during Harsha’s reign.
• He has given a very favourable account of king Harsha
and his empire.
• He praises his generosity and justice.
• Harsha was a great patron of the arts.
• He himself was an accomplished writer. He is credited
with the Sanskrit works Ratnavali, Priyadarshika and
Nagananda.
• Banabhatta was his court poet and he composed the
Harshacharita which gives an account of Harsha’s life
and deeds.
Interest in Literature
• Nagananda: It describes the story of the Jimutavahana’s self-sacrifice to save the
Nagas.
• Ratnavali: Ratnavali is a great drama, which narrates the story of a princess called
Ratnavali and a king called Udayana.
• Ratnavali is probably the earliest textual references to the celebration of Holi, the
festival of colors.
• Priyadarsika: Priyadarsika is another great play by Harsha.
• Harsha generously supported the Nalanda University.
• He had a good tax structure.
• In Harsha’s Empire, the king’s share was one-sixth of the agricultural produce.
• 1/4th of all the taxes collected were used for charity and for cultural purposes.
• Harsha was a competent military conqueror and an able administrator.
• Harsha was the last king to rule over a vast empire in India before the invasions by
the Muslims.
Conflict with Pulkesin II
• However, his long career of victory was eclipsed by one great failure against
Pulkesin II.
• Pulkesin II, the greatest of the Chalukya dynasty vied with Harsha and was able to
stop the ambitions of Harsha towards south.
• If Harsha was Uttarpathapati, Pulkesin II, the Chalukya King of Vatapi was able to
raise himself to the rank of lord paramount of the South and called
himself Dakshinapathapati.
• The defeat of Harshavardhana in the hands of Pulakesin II is mentioned on Aihole
inscription (Karnataka). He was the first North Indian king to be defeated by South
Indian King.
Conquest of Ganjam:
• The last conquest of Harsha was the Ganjam in modern Odisha.
• Harsha was not able to annex initially because of his enmity
with Shashanka.
• However, Ganjam was conquered in 642-643 AD and after that, Harsha
became content to sheathe the sword.
• The later part of Harsha’s life is almost an imitation to the Great Asoka
Maurya, but it took 37 years and numerous conquests to Harsha to adopt
the Asoka route.
Religion
• Harsha was last great Hindu king of North India.
• After the Ganjam conquest, Harsha started showing the favor for
the quietest teachings of Buddhism.
• He favored the Hinyana initially and Mahayana later.
• He forbade the slaughter of any living thing.
• Use of animal flesh was a punishable offense in his reign.
Religion
• Father of Harsha was a Sun Devotee,
• His remote ancestor Pushyabhuti was a Shiva follower,
• His brother Rajyavardhana and sister Rajyashri were Buddhism devotees,
• But Harsha was benevolent of all the three and erected temples also.
• However, the in the closing part of his reign, his favorite was the faith of
Buddhism.
• We find King Harsha’s autograph in Baanskhera inscription of Haryana.
• In his early life, Harsha was devoted to Shiva but later he became an
ardent Mahayana Buddhist under the influence of Chinese pilgrim Hieun
Tsang. He organised two assemblies :
• Kannauj Assembly Harsha organised a Kannauj assembly to honour
Chinese pilgrim Huan Tsang where he explained doctrines of Mahayana
Buddhism & claimed his superiority over others
• Prayag Assembly : 2
nd Mahayana Buddhism assembly by Harsha, marked
by great charity of Harsha where he even gave up his cloths as charity
• Who is Bhandi ?
• Bhandi was a leading noble of Kannauj and on advice of the political
leaders of Kannauj; he offered the crown of Kannauj to Harsha after death
of Grahavarmana.
• Bhandi was later described as one of the chief officers of Harsha.
• When Harsha chased Shashanka for release of his sister, through Bhandi
only Harsha could know that his sister has been released and Shashanka
has escaped.
• Who is Simhanada ?
• Simhanada was the General of the Harsha’s army and his Prime Minister.
• When Harsha was preparing to conquest the South, Simhanada warned
him about the dreadful consequences.
• This was for the first time that Harsha did not pay attention to his
seasoned councilor and paid the price for the same when Pulkesin II
defeated him.
Administration in Harshavardhana’s Reign
• The revenues of Harsha’s Empire were divided into four parts.
• The first part was spent on the king.
• The second part was spent on scholars.
• The third part was spent on public servants and the fourth part was spent
on religious activities.
• The administration during Harsha’s reign was similar to that of the Guptas.
Hiuen Tsang has described it in much detail.
• The administration was more feudal and decentralized during Harsh’s
reign as compared to that of the Guptas.
Administration in Harshavardhana’s Reign
• Harsha probably began the practice of granting land to officers in lieu of salary.
• The maintenance of Public records was a characteristic feature of
Harshavardhan’s administration.
• The records of good as well as bad events that occurred during the the time
have been recorded in them.
Administration in Harshavardhana’s Reign
• Taxation was light and forced labour was also rare.
• One-sixth of the crop produce was collected as land tax.
• The king made frequent visits of inspection throughout his dominion.
• Harshavardhans Army consisted of four divisions- foot, chariot, horse and
elephant. It was much more than that of the Mauryans.
• There was provision of cruel punishments, similar to the Mauryan times.
• Harshavardhan had diplomatic relations with China.
Society during Harsha’s rule
• There was fourfold Varna system in place comprising- Brahmins, kshatriya, Vaishya,
and Sudra.
• Brahmins received land grants from the king, Kshatriyas were the ruling class,
Vaishyas were involved in trading and Sudras practiced agriculture. There were
many sub-castes.
• Position of Women: Women lost the privileges of Swayamvar(the choice of
choosing the husband), Widow remarriage was not permitted, especially among
higher castes. The practice of Dowry and Sati became prevalent.
• Burial of dead: dead were disposed either by cremation, water burial or exposure
in the woods.
Economy
• During Harshavardhana’s reign, trade and commerce declined, as depicted
by an decrease in trade centres.
• This decline also affected handicraft and agriculture.
• This also led to rise of self-sufficient village economy.
Developments in Art & Culture
• The architecture during Harsha’s period
was based on Gupta style primarily.
• Hiuen Tsang refers to a 8 feet tall copper
Buddha statue.
• He also talk of a multistory monastery at
Nalanda.
• In Chhattisgarh at Sirpur, a brick temple
of Lakshman is surviving example of
architecture during Harsh’a period.
Harsha’s death
Harsha died in 647 AD after ruling for 41 years.
Since he died without any heirs, his empire disintegrated
very soon after his death.
Vakataka Dynasty
• The Vakataka dynasty ruled parts of
South-Central India from 250 AD to
500 AD.

Heat
By Dr Vipan Goyal

WHAT IS HEAT?
• Heat is a form of energy.
• Heat is measured by the temperature effect which it produces.
When heat is given to a substance its temperature rises.
• Temperature is the degree of hotness of a substance. Temperature
is measured in the unit of degree Celsius or Kelvin(k).It is measured
in Joules(J).
• E.g: Makes a hot air balloon rise, Steam engines
JOULE’S LAW OF HEATING
H = I2 R t
• This is known as Joule’s law of heating. The law implies that heat
produced in a resistor is (i) directly proportional to the square of
current for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to resistance
for a given current, and (iii) directly proportional to the time for
which the current flows through the resistor.
• One Watt Hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of
power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric
energy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.
• 1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second
 = 3.6 × 106 Watt second
 = 3.6 × 106 joule (J)
• Heat can be converted to other forms of energy
SUNLIGHT
• It is used by plants for photosynthesis, it is converted to chemical
energy. Food is a type of chemical. It breaks down using chemical
reaction by two process - Anabolism(Building) and
Catabolism(Breaking).
• Oil and gas are burnt in power stations to produce heat energy, this
is used to turn turbines which in-turns produce electricity(electrical
energy)
Production Of Heat
• The movement of particles/
molecules produces heat
Particles move about more and
take up more room if heated –
this is why things expand if
heated while on cooling , the
particles moves closer and
shrink.
• It is also why substances change
form when heated
FORMS OF HEAT TRANSFER
Energy can be transferred by 3 types:
Conduction Convection Radiation
RADIATION
• The transfer of heat in rays, from a
hot objects, without needing a
medium to pass through.
• It travels in all directions from a hot
object. The hotter an object is, the
more heat it will radiate out.
• Radiation does not require any
medium for propagation and it
propagates without heating the
intervening medium.
• A dull black surface will radiate and absorb heat better than a bright shiny
surface.
• White reflects heat radiation and keeps the house cooler.
Black Body
• A body that absorbs the entire radiation incident on it is called perfectly
black body.
• Ratio of heat absorbed (radiation) to total incident radiation for a body is
called absorptive power (a) of body. It has no unit.
• Amount of heat radiation per unit area of the surface at a given
temperature is called emissive power of the surface.
• The ratio of emissive power and absorptive power of a body is always
same.
• It is equal to emissive power of a black body. This is known as Kirchhoff’s
law.
• White colour is a bad absorbers and good reflectors of heat radiations
while black colour is good absorbers and bad reflectors of heat.
• Therefore, clothes of light colours give better feeling in summer and
clothes of dark colours give better feeling in winter.
• Stefan’s Law
• It states that “The amount of heat energy (E) radiated per second by unit
area of perfectly black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of
absolute temperature (T) of the body.”
• E ∝ T4
• Good absorbers are good emitters and poor absorbers are poor emitters.
Transmission of Heat
• Heat can be transferred from one place to another by process of
transmission.
• There are three methods of transmission of heat.
CONDUCTION
• When you heat a metal strip at one end, the heat travels to the
other end.
• As you heat the metal, the particles vibrates, these vibrations make
the adjacent particles vibrate, and so on and so on, the vibrations
are passed along the metals and so is the heat. We call this
Conduction.
CONDUCTORS/INSULATORS
• If a substance easily allows to move through it, we can say it is a
good conductor of heat. E.g: most metals.
• If a substance does not allow heat to pass through we can say it is
an insulator. E.g: wood, plastic, glass.
• Why do many sauce pans have plastic handles? As it provides
insulation to heat.
• The mode of transmission of heat in solids from higher temperature
part to lower temperature part without actual movement of the
particles, is called conduction.
CONDUCTORS/INSULATORS
• Transmission of heat in solids takes place mainly through conduction.
• Metals are good conductors of heat. Wood, cotton, wool, glass are bad
conductors of heat, dry air is also a bad conductor of heat.
• Woollen clothes do not allow the heat of our body to escape and
therefore we feel warm.
• On a cold night two thin blankets give more warmth than a single thick
blanket because the layer of air between the two blankets works as a
better insulator.
• Refrigerators and ice-boxes have double walls having thermocole between
them which minimize heat gain by conduction.
CONVECTION
• It is the way in which particles in a gas or liquid
move upwards, carrying heat with them.
• When you boil water, the bubbles move upwards
• A gas heater in the room, the heat rises around
the room.
• The mode of transmission of heat in fluids (liquids
and gases) due to actual movement of the
particles, is called convection.
CONVECTION
• In liquids and gases, heat is transmitted by convection.
• When a liquid in a vessel is heated at the bottom, the liquid at bottom
gets heated and expands.
• Due to its lower density, hot liquid rises and its place is taken by cold liquid
from above. Convection currents are set up in the liquid until the
temperature of the whole liquid becomes same.
• The cooling unit in a refrigerator is fitted near the top as cold air move
downward and keeps cool the whole interior.
• Radiator in a motor car works on the principle of convection.
Newton’s Law of Cooling
• The rate of loss of heat from a body is directly proportional to the
difference in temperatures of the body and its surroundings.
• If we take hot water and fresh water and put it in a refrigerator, then rate
of cooling of hot water will be faster than the fresh tap-water.
• Sea Breeze During day time, the seashore warms up much faster than sea
water. Hot air over the seashore rises and cooler air from sea water moves
towards seashore to take its place resulting in a sea breeze.
• Land Breeze At night, land cools faster than sea water. Now hot air over
sea water rises and cooler air from land moves towards sea to take its
place and resulting in a land breeze.
Newton’s Law of Cooling
• Cloudy nights are warmer than clear night because clouds reflect
the radiations emitted by the earth at night and keep it warm.
• Relation between Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit:
Expansion and Contraction
• The reason materials expand when heated is because the heat gives
the molecules energy and as a result they begin to move, leaving
them further apart and hence the material expands.
• Cooling has the opposite effect, the particles move closer together
causing the molecules to contract.
Expansion and Contraction
Why are bottle not filled up to the top?
Because the materials expand when they heat up we need to leave
room for that.
Temperature
• Temperature is measure of hotness or coldness of a body.
• The heat flows from one body to another due to the difference in
their body temperature.
• Scale of Temperature
• To measure the temperature of a body following temperature
scales are used.
• Celsius scale of temperature freezing point is 0°C
• Boiling point of water is 100°C
Temperature
• Fahrenheit scale of temperature ice point or freezing of water = 32° F
• Boiling point of water = 212° F
• Kelvin or absolute scale of temperature ice point of water = 273° K
• Boiling point of water = 373° K
• Reaumur scale of temperature ice point of water is 0° R,
• Boiling point of water = 80°R
• Rankine scale of temperature ice point /freezing point of water = 491.67°R
Boiling point of water = 671.641° R
Relation between Different Scales of Temperature
• Different scales of temperature are related as follows:
• C/ 100 = F – 32/180 = R/ 80 = K – 273/100
• K =273+ °C
• At temperature – 40°C = – 40°F,
• Celsius scale is equal to Fahrenheit
• The temperature at which the three phases of water remains at
equilibrium is called triple point of water (273.16 K)
Thermometers
• The instruments used to measure temperature of a body is called
thermometer.
• Thermometers are of following three types
 1. Clinical thermometer It is used to measure human body
temperatures and ranges from 96° F to 110°F or 35°C to 43°C.
 2. Electronic thermometer Basic components of an electronic
thermometer are thermistors or thermo-resistors. Range of
electronic thermometer is –40° to 450°F.
Thermometers
 3. Other thermometers these include constant volume gas
thermometer, platinum resistance thermometer etc.
• Clinical thermometer measures temperature in degree fahrenheit (°F).
• In thermometer, mercury is commonly used through a wide range from –
30°C to 300°C.
• Gas thermometer : -268 to 1500 degree Celsius
• Platinum Thermometer : -200 to 1200 degree celsius
• Thermometer was developed by Galileo who found that the gases expand
on heating.
• Alcohal thermometer is better than mercury thermometer due to greater
expansion.
Reasons for using Mercury in Thermometer
• Mercury is opaque and therefore temperature can be read conveniently.
• Mercury is a good conductor of heat and therefore temperature rapidly.
• Mercury does not stick to glass and also does not vaporized and therefore
yield correct reading.
• Water cannot be used in thermometer because it is at 0 degree celsius
and also because of its irregular expansion.
• In some countries where winter temperature of -40C is uncommon,
mercury thermometers cannot be used because mercury freezes at -39C.
In such countries, alcohol thermometers are useful since alcohol freezes at
-112C
Thermal Expansion
• The expansion of a body caused by heat is known as thermal
expansion.
Thermal Expansion of Solids
Thermal expansion of solids is of three types
• 1. Expansion in length on heating is called linear expansion. The
increase in length of a rod of unit length of a substance due to
increase in its temperature by 1°C is called the coefficient of linear
expansion of the substance of that rod. It is represented by α.
Thermal Expansion
• linear expansion = Increase in length / Initial length × Rise in
temperature
• α = ΔL= L × Δt
• Its unit is °C–1.
• 2. Expansion in area on heating, is called superficial expansion.
Coefficient of superficial expansion is given as
• β = Increase in area/ Initial area × Rise in temperature = ΔA/ A × Δt
• Its unit is °C–1.
Thermal Expansion
• 3. Expansion in volume on heating, is called volume expansion or
cubical expansion.
• Coefficient of volume or cubical expansion is given as γ = Increase in
volume/ Original volume × Rise in temperature = ΔV/ V × Δt
• Its unit is °C-1
Relation between Coefficients of Expansions
• Coefficients of thermal expansions are related as
• β = 2α and γ = 3α and α : β : γ = 1 : 2 : 3
• In laying a railway line, a small gap is left in between two iron rails
otherwise railway line will become curved on heating in summer.
• Telephone wires are not tighten on poles because in winter, wires
get contract and can break.
Thermal Expansion of Liquids
• In liquids, only expansion in volume takes place on heating.
• Expansion of liquid is of two types:
 When expansion of the container, containing liquid, on heating, is not
taken into account, then observed expansion is called apparent
expansion of liquids.
 When expansion of the container, containing liquid, on heating, is also
taken into account, then observed expansion is called real expansion
of liquids. γr = γa + γg
• where, γr and γa, are coefficients of real and apparent expansion of liquids
and γg = coefficient of cubical expansion of the container.
Anomalous Expansion of Water
• When temperature of water is increased from 0°C, then its volume
decreases up to 4°C, becomes minimum at 4°C and then increases.
• This behavior of water expansion around 4°C is called, anomalous
expansion of water.
Thermal Expansion of Gases
• There are two types of coefficient of expansion in gases.
• At constant pressure, the change in volume per unit volume per
degree celsius is called volume coefficient (γv).
• At constant volume, the change in pressure per unit, pressure per
degree celsius, is called pressure coefficient (yp).
Calorimetry
• Amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water
by 1°C is called 1 calorie.
• Calorimetry states that heat lost by hotter body equals the heat
gained by colder body.
Specific Heat
• The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass
(m) of a substance through 1°C, is called its specific heat (s).
• It is denoted by s and its unit is ‘cal/g°C or Joule/g°/C.
• The specific heat of water is 4200 J/kg1/°C or 1000cal/ g1/° C,
which is high compared with most other substances.
• Therefore, water is used as coolant in radiator in vehicle and hot
water is used for the fermentation.
Specific Heat
• Heat energy given or taken to change the temperature of a body is
given by Q = msΔθ
• Where, m = mass of the body and Δθ = change in temperature.
• The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 mole of
a gas by 1°C is called molar specific heat.
Latent Heat
• The heat energy absorbed or released at constant temperature per
unit mass for change of state, is called latent heat.
• It is denoted by L and its SI unit is cal/g or kcal/kg.
• Heat energy absorbed or released during change of state is given by
Q = mL
• where, m = mass of the substance.
• Latent heat of fusion of ice is 80 cal/g.
• Latent heat of vaporisation of steam is 536 cal/g.
Thermodynamics
• The branch of physics which deals with the study of relation of heat energy with
different types of energy is called thermodynamics.
• Zeroth Law: Zeroth law of thermodynamics tells about thermal equilibrium.
• First Law
 As per first law about energy, heat given to a substance is equal to sum of
change in internal energy and work done.
 Adiabatic process : if the changes are taking place in a system in such a way
that there is no exchange of heat energy between the system and the
surrounding, then he process is called adiabatic process.
 Example : if CO2 is suddenly expanded, it is changed into dry ice. This is an
example of adiabatic process.
Thermodynamics
• Isothermal process : if the changes are taking place in a system in such a way that
temperature of the system remains constant throughout the change, then the
process is said to be isothermal.
• Second Law
 In second law work can be converted into heat and vice-versa but conversion
is not possible with 100% efficiency.
 It is impossible for a machine operating in a cyclic process to convert heat
completely into work, it is kelvin’s statement.
 Heat by itself can not transfer from a colder to a hotter body. It is clausius
statement. Refrigerator is based on this statement.
Thermodynamics
 Heat engine is a device which converts heat into mechanical work.
Internal combustion and external combustion heat engine are two
types of heat engine.
 Car engine uses coolant added with water to reduce harmful effects
like corrosion, rusting etc. Such as ethylene glycol, Potassium
dichromate etc,
 Carnot’s theorem tells about maximum efficiency of heat engine. It
refers to Carnot cycle.
Thermodynamics
• Entropy measures the molecular disorder of a system and is a
thermodynamic function depending only on the temperature of the
system.
• Evaporation is a process in which molecules escape slowly from the
surface of a liquid.
• For a given liquid the rate of evaporation demands on the temperature
and area of evaporating surface.
• Refrigerator is a device used for cooling things by the evaporation and
compression of a volatile liquid inside a copper coil.
• Evaporation causes cooling. Examples :
• In summer season, water is stored in pitcher.
• Evaporation of ether at room temperature at room temperature leads
cooling.
• Water evaporating from the wet cloth produces cooling and brings the
temperature down.
• A desert cooler produces cooling by evaporation.
• Hot water burns are less severe than that of steam burns because steam
has high latent heat.
• Ice at zero degree Celsius appears colder than that water at zero degree
Celsius.
• Out of all substances, hydrogen has maximum specific heat.
• Triple point of water : The temperature at which all the three phases of
water i.e. solid, liquid and gas are in equilibrium with one another. It is
assigned by value of temperature 273.16 Kelvin.
Change of state
• Fusion : The process by which a substance is changed from solid state to liquid state
is called fusion.
• Fusion takes place at a fixed temperature called melting point.
• To convert a liquid to a solid we cool it below its freezing point. This process is
known as ‘Freezing’.
• For a substance M.P. = F.P.
• Melting point of a substance changes with change in pressure.
• Melting point of substances which contracts in the process of fusion (as ice)
decreases with increase in pressure.
• Melting point of substances which expands in the process of fusion (wax) increases
with increase in pressure.
• With the addition of impurity ( as salt in ice ), melting point of a substance
decreases.
• Vaporization: To convert liquids into gas you need to heat the liquid beyond its
boiling point or (liquid to vapor state)
• Boiling : the process of vaporization which takes place at a fixed temperature and
whole part of the liquid is called boiling.
• The temperature at which boiling takes place is called boiling point.
• Condensation : Process by which a substance is changed from vapor to liquid state
is called condensation.
• Boiling point of a liquid increases with increase in pressure.
• Boiling point of a liquid increases with addition of impurity.
• Latent Heat
• When the change of state occurs the temperature of a substance remains
constant during a change in the state.
• As if the change in state opens up new portals or spaces where our
supplied energy hides.
• Therefore we call this hidden energy, the latent or the hidden heat.
• Suppose we have a block of ice we want to convert to water. We all know
that ice turns to water and vice versa at 0°C. Now assume we start heating
ice at 0°C. You will observe that when we do so, the temperature of ice
does not change. It starts converting to water but the temperature does
not rise until the entire ice block has been converted to water.
• If a mass ‘m’ of any substance undergoes a change in state by absorbing an
amount of heat, Q at a constant Temperature T, then we have:
• L = Q/m or Q = mL
• All the heat supplied to the ice at 0
0C is used by the ice to change its phase from
solid to liquid. Thus the heat supplied is not used up to raise the temperature of
the substance.
• Latent Heat of Fusion
• The heat energy supplied per unit mass of a substance at its melting point to
convert the state of the substance from solid to liquid is known as Latent heat of
Fusion. Latent heat of Fusion of water is 334 Joules/gram of water.
• Latent Heat of Vaporization
• The heat that a substance absorbs per unit mass at its boiling point to convert the
phase of the substance from liquid to gas is the Latent heat of Vaporization. Latent
heat of Vaporization of water is 2230 Joules/gram of water.
• Sublimation
• The process in which a solid changes directly to a gas is called sublimation.
It occurs when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely
overcome the force of attraction between them. Dry ice (solid carbon
dioxide, CO2
) is an example of a solid that undergoes sublimation.
• Hoar frost
• Reverse process of sublimation.
• Steam produces more severe burn than that at same temperature
because internal energy of steam is more than that of water at same
temperature.
Humidity
• The presence of moisture in the atmosphere is called humidity.
• The amount of water vapour present in the unit volume of
atmosphere is called absolute humidity.
• The relative humidity of air at a given temperature is the ratio of
mass of water vapour present in a certain volume of air to the mass
of water vapour required to saturate the same volume of air at the
same temperature, multiplied by 100.
• Relative humidity is measured by hygrometer.
Humidity
• Relative humidity of about 50% is considered comfortable at
temperature 22° – 25° C.
• If the relative humidity is very low in air, then lips become dry and
cracks appear in them.
• If relative humidity is very high in air then the sweat from our body
does not evaporate readily and therefore we feel uncomfortable.
• Air conditioning provides comfortable conditions by regulating
temperature and humidity.
• Hoar Frost-is the reverse process of sublimation.
MEASUREMENT UNITS
• Angstrom: For measuring length of light waves
• Barrel: For measuring liquids. One barrel is equal to 31½ gallons or
7,326.5 cubic inches

POWER AND FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGH COURT
The jurisdiction and powers of the High Court can be classified into the
following:
1. Original Jurisdiction.
2. Writ Jurisdiction.
3. Appellate Jurisdiction.
4. Supervisory Jurisdiction.
5. Control over Subordinate courts
6. A Court of Record.
7. Power of Judicial Review.
©StudyIQ Education
1. Original Jurisdiction
It means the power of a high court to hear disputes in the first instance, not by way
of appeal.
It extends to the following:
(a)Matters of admirality, will, marriage, divorce, company laws and contempt of
court.
(b) Disputes in election of MPs and MLAs
(c) revenue matters.
(d) Enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens.
(e) Cases ordered to be transferred from a subordinate court involving the
interpretation of the Constitution to its own file.
©StudyIQ Education
2. Writ Jurisdiction
• Article 226 - Habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition and quo warranto
• for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of the citizens and for any other
purpose.
• The phrase ‘for any other purpose’ refers to the enforcement of an ordinary legal
right.
• Writ jurisdiction of the high court is wider than that of the Supreme Court –
 SC WRITS = Only FR
 HC WRITS = FR + ordinary legal rights
©StudyIQ Education
3. Appellate Jurisdiction
• A high court is primarily a court of appeal.
• It hears appeals against the judgements of subordinate courts functioning in
its territorial jurisdiction.
• It has appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters.
• Hence, the appellate jurisdiction of a high court is wider than its original
jurisdiction.
©StudyIQ Education
4. Supervisory Jurisdiction
A high court has the power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals
functioning in its territorial jurisdiction (except military courts or tribunals).

promotion of district judges + appointments to the judicial service
(b) It deals with the matters of posting, promotion, grant of leave, transfers and
discipline of the members of the judicial service of the state (other than district
judges).
6. A Court of Record

7. Power of Judicial Review
Power of the High Court to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments
and executive orders of both the central and state governments.
• The High Court has the power to review its own judgment or order.
NOTE -
Judicial review not mentioned directly in const. Art 13 and 226 give HC this power
©StudyIQ Education
• The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 - curtailed the judicial review power of
high court.
 High courts could not consider the constitutional validity of any central
law.
©StudyIQ Education
MISCELLANEOUS:
• High Court is the highest Court of appeal in the state.
• The High Court is the protector of Fundamental Rights of the citizens.
• The High Courts are vested with the power to interpret the Constitution but
the final interpreter is the Supreme Court.
• In the absence of the CJ the President can appoint a judge of a High Court as
an acting Chief Justice of the High Court.

History of the Working Class
Movement in British India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

History of the working class
movement in British India
• The early nationalist advocated the improvement of economic conditions
of the working classes.
• In 1870, Sasipada Banerjee started a Working Man’s Club and
newspaper ‘Bharat Shramjeevi’.
• In 1878, Sorabjee Shapoorji Bengalee drafted a bill for providing better
working conditions to the labourers and tried to pass in the Bombay
Legislative Council.
• In 1880, the Bombay Mill and Millhands Association was set up by Narain
Meghajee Lokhanday. He also started newspaper ‘Deenbandhu’.
• In 1899, first strike took place in the Indian Peninsula Railways.
• Tilak’s newspaper i.e. Kesari and Maharatta supported the strike and
launched the campaign for months.
• During Swadeshi Movement, Indian working classes came with wider
political issues.
• Ashwini Coomar Banerjee, Prabhat Kumar Roy Chaudhari, Premtosh
Bose and Apurba Kumar Ghosh organised mass level strikes in the
government press, railways and the jute industries.
• The biggest strike was organised when Bal Gangadhar Tilak was arrested
and faced trial.
Formation of Trade Union:
• On October 31, 1920, All India Trade Union Congress was founded.
• Lala Lajpat Rai was then became the first president and Dewan
Chaman Lal was the first general secretary.
• Lala Lajpat Rai was the first person who linked capitalism with
imperialism and gave the statement, ‘Imperialism and militarism
are the twin children of capitalism’.
• CR Das, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, CF Andrews, JM
Sengupta, Satyamurthy, VV Giri and Sarojini Naidu supported the
formation of trade union.
• In 1918, the trade Union has emerged as a pressure group in a capitalist society
because during this year Gandhi helped to organise the Ahmedabad Textile
Labour Association and their demand in wage hike which was arbitrated 35
percent instead of 27.5 percent.
• In 1926, British government came with the trade union Act to formalize the trade
union as a legal association.
• It also laid down eligibility criteria for registration and regulation of trade union
activities.
• This act not only secured the immunity for both civil and criminal from prosecution
for the legitimate activities of the trade union act but also imposed restrictions on
their political activities.
• In 1928 during Bombay Textile Mills, strike led by Girni Kamgar Union changed the
picture of Trade union politics due to the emergence of Communist.
• SA Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, PC Joshi and Sohan Singh Joshi were the famous
trade union leaders of that time.
• This strike was an alarming situation for the British government that laid the
formation of the Public Safety Ordinance of 1929 and the Trade Disputes Act of
1929.
• These acts made compulsory to the appointment of courts of Inquiry and
Consultation Boards for settling industrial disputes.
• It also made strike in public utility services like posts, railways, water and electricity
as an illegal action unless working class union prior notified to the administration a
month before.
• Meerut Conspiracy Case of 1929: The British arrested 31 labour leaders and trial
of three and a half year resulted in the conviction of working class leaders
like Muzaffar Ahmed, SA Dange, Joglekar, Philip Spratt, Ben Bradley and
Shaukat Usmani.
• This case and trial received worldwide publicity, but weakened the working class
movement in India.
• After 1930, the working class union of India fractioned as the communist
approach of trade union and corporatist approach.
• NM Joshi set up All India Trade Union Federation in 1931.
• In 1935, All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was reaffirmed by communists,
congress socialist and leftist nationalists like JL Nehru and Subhas Chandra
Bose.
• Impact of Second World War: Initially, working class opposed the war
when Russia joined the war on the behalf of the allies supported by the
working class.
• In 1945, dock workers of Bombay (now Mumbai) and Calcutta (now
Kolkata) refused to load ships taking supplies to the warring troops in
Indonesia.
Above historical timeline reflects that their main motive was to improve a low
wage situation, long working hours, unhygienic and hazardous working
conditions, child labour and improvement in basic amenities.

• First Factory Act, 1881
 Commission for this purpose was constituted in 1874.

Lord Morley - Secretary of State for India (in London)
Lord Minto II - Viceroy of India (in Calcutta)
Background –
 Rising extremism – not good for British rule
 Hence they wanted to give concession to Moderate demands while
cracking down on extremism
 They also wanted to further the divide and rule policy via Separate
electorate
 Curzon’s imperialist approach and policies had left the Indians
resentful
 In 1906, a group of Muslim elites called the Shimla deputation, led by
the Agha Khan, met Lord Minto & demanded separate electorates for
the Muslims.
. The principle of election to the councils was legally recognized. But
communal representation was for the first time introduced in the
interests of Muslims. Separate electorates were provided for the
Muslims
 The electorate was decided on the basis of CLASS AND
COMMUNITY.
 12 December,1911
 In honour of King George V & Queen Mary
 Only Durbar where the British Monarch actually attended
 Lord Hardinge made announcements :
Annulement of Partition of Bengal (but new divisions based on language )
Shifting of capital from Calcutta to Delhi (done on 12/12/1912)
*Shimla was the summer capital since 1863

Important events during his term
 Transfer of capital from Calcutta to Delhi (1911).
 Coronation durbar of King George V held in Delhi (1911)
 Annulment of Bengal Partition.
 Establishment of the Hindu Mahasabha (1915) by Madan Mohan
Malaviya and others
 In 1916, Lord Hardinge laid the foundation of the Banaras Hindu
University.
(Madan Mohan Malaviya was the Founder-Chancellor of this university)
Lord Hardinge Bombing case
 23 Dec 1912 – Viceroy was entering the new capital of Delhi in a
procession from Chandni chowk to New Delhi
 A bomb was thrown on his carriage bt it missed the mark – viceroy
escaped unhurt
 Sachindranath Sanyal and Ras Bihari Bose - escaped
 In the First World War (1914-1919), Britain allied with France, Russia, USA,
Italy and Japan against Germany, Austria, Hungary and Turkey.
 The nationalist response to British participation in the War was three-fold :
1. The Moderates supported the empire in the War as a matter of duty
2. The extremists, including Tilak (who was released in June 1914),
supported the war efforts in the mistaken belief that Britain would repay
India’s loyalty with gratitude in the form of self-government;
3. The revolutionaries decided to utilize the opportunity to wage a war and
liberate the country
 1.3 million Indian soldiers served under the British army in the great
war
 ~50,000 laid down their lives for the British Empire
 India gate, New Delhi - war memorial
 The Home Rule Movement was the Indian response to the First World
War
 Annie Besant, the Irish theosophist, had decided of a movement for
Home Rule on the lines of the Irish Home Rule Leagues
 Tilak was ready to assume leadership after his release in 1914, and
reassured Government of his loyalty and to the Moderates that he, like
the Irish Home Rulers, wanted a reform of the administration and not
the overthrow of the British Government in India.
 The home rule league mainly aimed at
 Getting self-government for India within the British Empire
 Formation of linguistic based states
 Education in the vernacular Languages
Two Home Rule Leagues were established (not simultaneously) by -
1. B G Tilak at Poona in April 1916
2. Annie Besant at Madras in September 1916
 Tilak’s Movement concentrated on Maharashtra ,Karnataka, Central
Provinces and Berar
 Annie Besant’s Movement covered the rest of India
Newspapers :
Maratha and Kesari - BG Tilak
New India and Commonweal - Annie Besant
*Shyamji Krishna Verma,Bhikaji Cama set up an Indian Home rule
Society in London in 1905
*Lala Lajpat Rai started the Indian Home Rule League of America in New
York in 1917 (Publication – Young India)
 The two Leagues cooperated with each other as well with the Congress
and the Muslim League in putting their demand for home rule.
 The Home Rule Movement had brought a new life in the national
movement (Revival of Swadeshi movement) with women joining in
larger numbers.
 It worked round the year , unlike INC
*Who did not Join this movement ?
 Anglo-Indians
 Most of the Muslims (Jinnah was a core leader of the League though)
 Non-Brahmins from South
They all felt Home Rule would mean rule of the Hindu majority, mainly
the higher caste Hindus
 The Government came down with severe repression, especially in
Madras where the students were prohibited from attending political
meetings.
 Tilak was barred from entering in Punjab & Delhi.
 In 1917, Annie Besant & her associates were arrested which invited
nationwide protests (G.Subramaniya Aiyar renounced his knighthood)
 Government decided to placate the nationalists by declaring its
intention to grant self-government to Indians, as contained in
Montagu’s August 1917 declaration.
 Montagu promised the gradual development of self-governing
institutions in India. (‘’A responsible govt.’’)
 This August Declaration led to the end of the Home Rule Movement.
 Tilak’s and Besant’s efforts in the Moderate-Extremist reunion at
Lucknow (1916) revived the Congress as an effective instrument of
Indian nationalism.
 INC factions united = Moderate + Extremist united
 INC President - Ambica Charan Mazumdar
 An understanding for joint action against the British was reached
between the Congress and Muslim League and it was called the
Lucknow Pact
 Marked an important step in the Hindu-Muslim unity.
 INC accepted separate electorates (1909) of Muslims for the first time

Important Development Indexes
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Human Development Index (HDI)
• The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistics of
life expectancy, education, and income indices to rank countries
into four tiers of human development.
• It was created by economist Mahbub-ul-Haq, followed by
economist Amartya Sen in 1990, and published by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
• In its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a
new method of calculating the HDI.
Human Development Index (HDI)
• The following three indices are used:
1. Life Expectancy Index
2. Education Index: It includes
a. Mean Years of Schooling Index
b. Expected Years of Schooling Index
3. Income Index
Computing the HDI
• To construct the Index, fixed minimum and maximum values have
been established for each of the indicators:
i. Life expectancy at birth: 25 years and 85 years.
ii. General literacy rate: 0 per cent and 100 per cent.
iii. Real GDP per capita (PPP$); PPP$ 100 and PPP$ 40,000.
Inequality-adjusted HDI
• The 2010 Human Development Report was the first to calculate an Inequalityadjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).
• The HDI represents a national average of human development achievements in the
three basic dimensions making up the HDI: Health, education and income.
• Like all averages, it conceals disparities in human development across the
population within the same country.
• Two countries with different distributions of achievements can have the same
average HDI value.
• The HDI takes into account not only the average achievements of a country on
health, education and income, but also how those achievements are distributed
among its citizens by “discounting” each dimension’s average value according to its
level of inequality.
• 14 September 2018 – India climbed one spot to 130 out of 189 countries in the latest
human development rankings released today by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP).
• India’s HDI value for 2017 is 0.640, which put the country in the medium human
development category. Between 1990 and 2017, India’s HDI value incased from 0.427
to 0.640, an increase of nearly 50 percent – and an indicator of the country’s
remarkable achievement in lifting millions of people out of poverty.
• Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland and Germany lead the ranking, while Niger, the
Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi have the lowest scores in the
HDI’s measurement of national achievements in health, education and income.
• Within South Asia, India’s HDI value is above the average of 0.638 for the region, with
Bangladesh and Pakistan, countries with similar population size, being ranked 136 and
150 respectively.
Gender Inequality Index
• The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is a new index that was
introduced in the 2010 Human Development Report’s 20th
anniversary edition by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) for the measurement of gender disparity.
• According to the UNDP, this index is a composite measure which
captures the loss of achievement within a country due to gender
inequality and uses three dimensions to do so: (i) Reproductive
health, (ii) Empowerment, and (iii) Labour market participation.
Gender Inequality Index
• The new index was introduced as an experimental measure to rectify the
shortcomings of the previous, and no longer used indicators, the Gender
Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM),
both of which were introduced in the 1995 Human Development Report.
• The GII's dimension of reproductive health has two indicators: (i) The
Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) and (ii) The Adolescent Fertility Rate
(AFR)
• The empowerment dimension is measured by two indicators: (i) The share
of parliamentary seats held by each sex and (ii) Higher education
attainment levels
Gender Inequality Index
• The labour market dimension is measured by women's participation
in the workforce. This dimension accounts for paid work, unpaid
work, and actively looking for work. According to the Human
Development Report 2011, India ranks 129 out of 146 countries on
the Gender Inequality Index, below Bangladesh and Pakistan,
which are ranked at 112 and 115, respectively
• Among BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) nations,
India has the highest inequalities in human development
Multidimensional Poverty Index
• The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) was developed in 2010
by Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative and the United
Nations Development Programme and uses different factors to
determine poverty beyond income-based lists. It replaced the
previous Human Poverty Index.
• The MPI is an index of acute multidimensional poverty. It shows the
number of people who are multidimensionality poor (suffering
deprivations in 33.33% of weighted indicators) and the number of
deprivations with which poor households typically contend.
Multidimensional Poverty Index
• It reflects deprivations in very
rudimentary services and core
human functioning for people.
• The index uses the same three
dimensions as the Human
Development Index: (i) Health,
(ii) Education, and (iii) Standard
of living. These are measured
using 10 indicators.
Dimensions Indicators
Health  Child Mortality
 Nutrition
Education  Years of school
 Children enrolled
Living Standards  Cooking fuel
 Toilet
 Water
 Electricity
 Floor
 Assets
Technological Achievement Index (TAI)
• The Technology Achievement Index (TAI) is used by the UNDP
(United Nations Development Programme) to measure how well a
country is creating and diffusing technology and building a human
skill base, reflecting capacity to participate in the technological
innovations of the network age.
• The TAI focuses on four dimensions of technological capacity: (i)
Creation of technology, (ii) Diffusion of recent innovations, (iii)
Diffusion of old innovations, and (iv) Human skills.
Technological Achievement Index (TAI)
• Technology creation: Measured by the number of patents granted to
residents per capita and by receipts of royalties and license fees from
abroad per capita
• Diffusion of recent innovations: Measured by the number of Internet
hosts per capita and the share of high-technology and medium-technology
exports in total goods exported
• Diffusion of old innovations: Measured by telephones (mainline and
cellular) per capita and electricity consumption per capita
• Human skills: Measured by the mean years of schooling in the population
aged 15 and older and the gross tertiary science enrolment ratio
Sustainable Development
• The term Sustainable Development was used by the Brundtland
Commission which has become the most often-quoted definition of
Sustainable Development: "Development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs".
• Sustainable Development ties together concern for the carrying capacity
of natural systems with the social challenges faced by humanity. As early
as the 1970s, "sustainability" was employed to describe an economy "in
equilibrium with basic ecological support systems". Ecologists have
pointed to The Limits to Growth.
Sustainable Development
• The concept of Sustainable Development has in the past most often been
broken into three constituent parts: Environmental sustainability,
Economic Sustainability and sociopolitical Sustainability.
• Green Development is generally differentiated from Sustainable
Development in that Green development prioritizes what its proponents
consider to be environmental sustainability over economic and cultural
considerations.
• Proponents of Sustainable Development argue that it provides a context
to improve overall sustainability where cutting edge Green Development is
unattainable.
Sustainable Development
• Inclusive green growth is the pathway to Sustainable Development.
• It is the only way to reconcile the rapid growth required to bring
developing countries to the level of prosperity which they aspire, meet the
needs of the more than nearly 1 billion people still living in poverty, and
fulfill the imperative requirement of a better Global Environment.
• Three Pillars of Sustainability
 The three pillars of sustainability are a powerful tool for defining the
Sustainable Development problem. This consists of three parameters:
Economic, Social, and Environmental pillars. If any one pillar is weak
then the system as a whole is unsustainable.
Importance of Sustainable Development
• Social Sustainability
 Social Sustainability is the ability of a social system, such as a
country, family, or organization, to function at a defined level of
social well-being and harmony indefinitely.
 Problems like war, endemic poverty, widespread injustice, and
low education rate are symptoms of a system that is socially
unsustainable.
Importance of Sustainable Development
• Environmental Sustainability
 Environmental Sustainability is the ability of the environment to
support a defined level of environmental quality and natural
resource extraction rates indefinitely.
 This is the world's biggest actual problem, though, since the
consequences of not solving the problem now are delayed, the
problem receives too low a priority to be solved.
Importance of Sustainable Development
• Economic Sustainability
 Economic Sustainability is the ability of an economy to support a
defined level of economic production indefinitely.
 Since the Great Recession of 2008 this is the world's biggest
apparent problem which endangers progress due to
environmental sustainability problem.

Civil Services Policy of British
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Indian Civil Service
• The term 'Civil Service' refers to the administrative machinery
of the state which is responsible for implementing policies
made by the political executive, which constitutes of the
elected representatives in a democracy.
Evolution of Civil Services in India
The Indian state had some form of civil service since the ancient
past
• Mauryan Empire had a centralized bureaucracy which was
responsible for tax administration, as mentioned in Kautilya's
Arthashastra.
• Such a governing machinery existed under Gupta period as well
• The Mughals had created an elaborate bureaucracy known as
the Mansabdari system which ranked officers based on number
of troops they commanded.
Evolution of Civil Services in India
 Until the rule of East India Company, there was no clear
demarcation between civilian officials and military officials.
Also, payment of salaries to these officials varied from cash
payments to in-kind payments such as land grants.
 The British had systematized civil services in India by
distinguishing it from the military services, creating a
hierarchy of officials who are paid out of public revenues.
Civil Service under the Company's Rule
• Need for the civil service was felt soon after the Company acquired
territories after the Battles of Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764).
• Warren Hastings, the then Governor-General of Bengal had created the
post of District Collector who was made in-charge of collecting land
revenue.
• This post was soon abolished on grounds of excessive concentration of
powers and corruption.
Civil Service under the Company's Rule
• Lord Cornwallis is usually known as the Father of civil services in India. He had
introduced the Covenanted Civil Services and the Uncovenanted Civil Services.
• The Covenanted Civil Services was created out of the Law of the Company. It
was the higher civil services and comprised, almost exclusively, of Europeans
who were paid very high salaries.
• The Uncovenanted Civil Services were the lower civil services and comprised
mostly of native-born Indians, and to some extent, Europeans too. They were
not paid as high as the Covenanted Civil Services.
• Charter Act of 1833, provided that no Indian subject be barred from holding
any office under the company. This however did not alter the structure of
British bureaucracy
Civil Service under the Company's Rule
• Until 1853, the Court of Directors had exclusive right to appoint persons in
the Company's civil services.
• These appointments were a source of privilege and patronage which the
Company held on to very tightly.
• The Charter Act of 1853 provided for an open competitive examination for
recruitment of civil servants and had deprived the Court of Directors of
the power of appointments based on patronage.
• This was recommended by a committee headed by Lord Macaulay. First
competitive exam was held in 1855.
Civil Service under the Crown's Rule:
After 1857's revolt
• After the Government of India Act of 1858, the higher civil service in India
came to be known as the Indian Civil Services (ICS).
• The Indian Civil Services Act of 1861 provided that certain posts under the
Government of India were to be reserved for persons who had been a
resident of India for 7 years or more.
• This paved the way for the entry of Indians into the higher civil services.
• The Indian Civil Services Act of 1870 carried the process of Indianization of
civil services forward.
• Satyendranath Tagore was the first Indian to get selected in the Indian Civil
Services.
Civil Service under the Crown's Rule:
After 1857's revolt
• Aitchison Committee was appointed by Lord Dufferin to recommend
changes in the civil services.
• The Committee recommended that the Covenanted and Uncovenanted
Civil Services should be changed into Imperial, Provincial, and Subordinate
civil services.
• ICS came to be regarded as the steel frame of the British rule in India i.e. it
provided the support for maintaining control over the vast territories of
the British Empire.
Civil Service under the Crown's Rule:
After 1857's revolt
• With the August Declaration of 1917 by Edwin Montague in the House of
Commons, which had promised an increase in the association of Indians in
the administration.
• The proportion of Indians in the civil services began to increase
significantly and by 1930s Indians were in majority in the civil services.
• By 1934, there were seven All India Services including the Indian Forest
Service, Indian Police, Indian Political Service etc.
Characteristics of Civil Services at the time
• It reflected the deep-seated racial prejudice among British against Indians
• Almost all the higher level posts were reserved for Europeans.
• Only the low paid jobs were open for Indians.
• The recruitment process involved examinations that were held in London
and involved knowledge of subjects (Greek, Latin, English) alien to Indian
natives, as a result Indian representation in the Services was negligible.
• In 1860, the maximum age limit was lowered from 23 years to 22 years.
This was further lowered to 21 years in 1866.
Post-Independence Civil Service
Development
• Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was among the top nationalist leaders who had
argued for the continuation of the civil services because he had believed
that an organized bureaucracy was essential to ensure the unity and
integrity of the newly independent India.
• He had also stressed the need for having All India Services such as the IAS,
IPS, and IFoS to ensure uniformity in the administrative system throughout
the country. This was essential for national unity.
Regulations and Legislation Relating
to the Services - Through Time
• Recruitment to the civil service was made based on open competitive
examination after the passage of Charter Act, 1853.
• Aitchison Commission had recommended that the minimum and
maximum age limits to appear for the exam were to be 19 and 23
respectively.
• Viscount Lee Commission, set up in 1923, had recommended the creation
of a public service commission for the purpose of conducting
examinations to recruit the civil servants.
• Accordingly, a public service commission was set up in 1926.
Regulations and Legislation Relating
to the Services - Through Time
• The Government of India Act, 1935 enlarged the powers of the
commission and made it a Federal Public Service Commission.
• After independence, it became the Union Public Service Commission, with
constitutional status since 1950.
• UPSC is empowered to conduct the civil services examination for the
purpose of selecting and recommending the candidates to be appointed
as civil servants.

 Indian National Army
 The idea of the Indian National Army (INA) was first conceived in Malaya by Mohan
Singh, an Indian officer of the British Indian Army, when he decided not to join the
retreating British Army and instead turned to the Japanese for help.
 The Japanese handed over the Indian prisoners of war (POWs) to Mohan Singh who
tried to recruit them into an Indian National Army.
 Rash Behari Bose
 In 1942, After the fall of Singapore, Mohan Singh further got 45,000 POWs into his
sphere of influence.
 2 July 1943, Subhash Chandra Bose reached Singapore and gave the rousing war cry of
‘Dilli Chalo’


 Bose was made the President of Indian Independence League and soon became the
supreme commander of the Indian National Army
 Here he gave the slogan of Jai Hind.
 INA’s three Brigades were the Subhas Brigade, Gandhi Brigade and Nehru Brigade.
 The women’s wing of the army was named after Rani Laxmibai. (Capt.Laxmi Sehgal)
 INA marched towards Imphal after registering its victory over Kohima but after
Japan’s surrender in 1945, INA failed in its efforts.
 Under such circumstances, Subhash went to Taiwan & further on his way to
Tokyo he died on 18 August 1945 in a plane crash.
 Trial of the soldiers of INA was held at Red Fort in Delhi.
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Kailash Nath Katju, Asaf Ali and
Tej Bahadur Sapru fought the case on behalf of the soldiers.

Indus Valley
Civilization
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Introduction
• Indus Valley Civilization was the
first major civilization in
South Asia, which spread across a
vast area of land in present-day
India and Pakistan (around 12 lakh
sq.km).
• The Indus Valley Civilization was
established around 3300 BC. It
flourished between 2700 BC and
1900 BC (Mature Indus Valley
Civilization).
• It started declining around 1900 BC
and disappeared around 1400 BC.
Features of Indus Valley Civilization
• The most accepted period : 2500-1750 ( by CarbonDating)
• John Marshall was the ist scholar to use the term Indus Civilisation.
• Indus Civilization belongs to Proto-History period ( Chalcolithic
age/Bronze Age)
• This is also called Harappan Civilization after the first city to be
excavated, Harappa (Punjab, Pakistan).
• Pre-Harappan civilization has been found at Mehrgarh, Pakistan
which shows the first evidence of cotton cultivation
Geographical Stretch
• Geographically, this civilization covered
Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, Rajasthan,
Gujarat and Western Uttar Pradesh. It
extended from Sutkagengor (in
Baluchistan) in the West to Alamgirpur
(Western UP) in the East; and from
Manda (Jammu) in the North to
Daimabad (Ahmednagar, Maharashtra)
in the South.
• Some Indus Valley sites have also been
found in as far away as Afghanistan and
Turkmenistan

Geographical Stretch
• The total geographical stretch of Harappan
civilization is about 1,250,000 sq. km which is more
than 20 times of the area of Egyptian and more than
12 times of the combined area of Egyptian and
Mesopotamian civilizations.
Geographical Stretch
• Large cities settlements such as:
 Mohenjo Daro (+250 hectares), Pak
 Harappa (+150 hectares), Pak
 Kalibangan (+100 hectares), Rajasthan
 Dholavira (+100 hectares), Gujarat
 Ganawariwala (+80 hectares), Pak
 Rakhigarhi (+80 hectares), Hisar, Haryana
Geographical Area
• Large cities were surrounded by vast agricultural lands, rivers, and
forest that were inhabited by scattered farming and pastoral
communities and bands of hunters and food-gatherers.
• Excavations at the sites of Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, Kalibangan,
Lothal, Surkotada, Dholavira, etc. have given us a fair idea about the
various aspects such as town planning, economy, technology,
religion, etc. of this civilization.
• Capital cities : Harappa, Mohenjodaro
• Port Cities : Lothal , Sutkagendor, Balakot etc.
Characteristics of Indus Valley Civilization
• The orientation of streets and buildings,
according to the cardinal directions eastwest, and north-south was the
distinguishing factor of the IndusSaraswati cities.
• Harappan city sites, including Mohenjo
Daro, Harappa, Kalibangan, and
Surkotada were having large gateways at
various entry points of the city. These
gateways are seen even in the inner
fortification areas also.
Great Bath of Mohenjo Daro
• The Great Bath of Mohenjo
Daro is the most
remarkable feature of any
Harappan site
• The Great Bath was a brick
structure, which measured
12 m X 7 m and is nearly 3
m deep from the
surrounding pavement.
Great Bath of Mohenjo Daro
• The bath was linked with some sort of
ritual bathing, which was very common in
Indian life right from the ancient times to
till date.
• Immediately to the west of the Great
Bath (at Mohenjo Daro) was a group of
blocks of brickwork crisscrossed by
narrow lanes. These structures have been
identified as granaries, which were used
for storing grains.
• Similar structures have been also found
at Harappa, Kalibangan, and Lothal.
DOCKYARD
• The dockyard found at Lothal was
another important structure. It
was a large structure provided
with an inlet channel in the
eastern wall and a spillway.
• The inlet channel was connected
to a river. This was a dockyard
where ships and boats used to
come for loading and unloading
of trading goods.
• Lothal was a major trading center
of the Harappan civilization.
Streets and Drains
• The most outstanding features of
the Harappan civilization were the
streets and side lanes equipped
with drains system.
• The streets cut each other on the
right angles.
• This indicates that people had a
great civic sense of sanitation and
care for health and hygiene.
• Burnt bricks were used to make
drains.
Harappan Crafts & Industries
The Harappan civilization is referred to as a Bronze Age civilization. (Copper + Tin)
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
Citadel/Acropolis at cities for member of ruling class & brick houses below citadel in town for commoners
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
• Remarkable grid system of roads : Roads cutting at right angle to
each other
• Large scale use of burnt bricks & total absence of stone buildings
• Agriculture technology was well developed (But no use of
ploughshare): Wheat, Rice, Barley, Peas etc. and they
Domesticated large scale of animals
• Cotton was 1st produced by Indus people hence Greeks called it
Sindon which is derived from Sindh
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
• Harappan were 1st to produce silver in the world + wore gold,
silver & beads Jewelry
• Practiced boat making, seal making, Bronze smith etc.
• Granaries & seals show Harappan carried on considerable
trade but only through Barter system
• No temples has been found at any of the site hence can be
said that it was ruled by merchants not priests
Developments in Indus Valley Civilization
• Worshiped Goddess Earth, Pipal Tree, Pashupati Mahadeva &
Animals (Bull / Unicorn Rhino)

• Used weights for trade (Mostly in multiple of 16) & Bronze made
marked sticks for measurements
• Were expert in Potter’s wheel & pottery making
• Their greatest artistic creation was ” Seals”
• Mostly limestone was used for sculptures.
Seals – Indus Valley Civilization
• Engraved in pictographic
script – writing is right to left
and yet to be deciphered
• Used on steatite (mainly), soft
river stone (Terracota) , gold
& ivory and mainly used for
trade and commerce

• Bronze casting was widely .
• The red sandstone torso found at Harappa is made up of
detachable limbs and head.
Torso Red sandstone Bust of a bearded man
A dancing girl statue
of about 11.5 cm. in
height made up of
bronzes was found
from Mohenjo Daro.
Terracotta – Indus Valley Civilization
• Terracotta is a fire baked clay and is
handmade.
• Examples include Mother Goddess,
Toy carts with wheels etc.
• Compared to stone and bronze
statues the terracotta representations
of human form are crude.
Mother Goddess
Toy carts with wheels
Pottery – Indus Valley Civilization
• Mainly plain, red and black painted – Plain pottery is more common
than painted
• Consists chiefly of very fine wheel- made wares, & very few being
hand-made
• Used for household purpose (storage of water, food grains etc.)
• Used For decoration- Miniature vessels used for decoration (Less
than 1/2 inch)
• Used as perforated pottery (large hole at the bottom and small
holes all over the wall, and probably was used for straining liquor)
Pottery – Indus Valley Civilization
Beads and Ornaments
• Made of precious metals, gemstones, bone and even
baked clay
• Necklaces, armlets and finger rings were common
• Evidences of dead bodies buried along with
ornaments have also been found
• Cinnabar was used as cosmetic, Lipstick, & face-paint
• Even eyeliner’s were all known to them
Beads and Ornaments
Trade &Commerce
• Intensive agricultural production and large-scale
trade played significant roles in flourishing of the
Harappan civilization.
• Agricultural produce, industrial raw materials
(including copper ores, stone, semiprecious shells,
etc.) were traded on a large scale.
Trade &Commerce
• They procured:
 Copper from Khetri mines of Rajasthan;
 Chert blades (crystals of quartz) from Rohri hills of Sindh;
 Carnelian (brownish-red mineral)beads from Gujarat and Sindh;
 Lead from south India;
 Lapis-lazuli (Blue intense gemstone) from Kashmir and Afghanistan;
 Turquoise (green blue stone) and jade (ornamental green) from central
Asia or Iran;
 Amethyst (violet quartz) from Maharashtra; and
 Agate (fineness of grain and variety of color), chalcedony, and carnelian
from Saurashtra
Trade &Commerce
• The occurrence of mature Harappan seals and other artefacts
in contemporary Mesopotamian civilization, and some of the
Mesopotamian and Egyptian objects in Harappan civilization,
and the evidence of Mesopotamian documents established
that the Harappans had the trading relationship with each
other.
Trade &Commerce
Weights &Measures
• The trade requires a regulation of exchange and of weights and
measures
• The system of weights proceeded in a series i.e. o first doubling,
from 1, 2, 4, 8, to 64, then going to 160; then
• Decimal multiples of sixteen, 320, 640, 1600, 6400 (1600 x 4), 8000
(1600 x 5) and 128,000 (i.e. 16000 x 8).
• The tradition of 16 or its multiples continued in India till 1950s.
• Harappan weights and measures were cubical and spherical in
shape and were made up of chert, jasper, and agate
Weights &Measures
Script
• The language of Harappan is still unknown. But some scholars connect it
to the Dravidian languages and others to Indo-Aryan and Sanskrit.

• Pashupathi Mahadev (Proto Siva)
• Mother goddess
• Nature/ Animal worship
• Unicorn, Dove, Peepal Tree, Fire
• Amulets
• Idol worship was practised ( not a feature of Aryans)
• Did not construct temples.
• No Caste system
Indus Valley Society and Culture
• The systematic method of weights and measures (
16 and its multiples).
• Pictographic Script, Boustrophedon script –
Deciphering efforts by I. Mahadevan
• Equal status to men and women
• Economic Inequality, not an egalitarian society
• Textiles – Spinning and weaving
• 3 types – burial, cremation and post-cremation
were there, though burial was common.
• Majority of people Proto-Australoids and
Mediterranean (Dravidians), though Mongoloids,
Nordics etc were present in the city culture.
Indus Valley Civilization important sites
• In India: Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Lothal, Dholavira, Rangpur,
Surkotda (Gujarat), Banawali (Haryana), Ropar (Punjab).
• In Pakistan: Harappa (on river Ravi), Mohenjodaro (on Indus River in
Sindh), Chanhudaro (in Sindh).
• The civilization was first discovered during an excavation campaign
under Sir John Hubert Marshall in 1921–22 at Harappa following
the discovery of seals by J Fleet.
• Harappan ruins were discovered by Marshall, Rai Bahadur Daya
Ram Sahni and Madho Sarup Vats.
Indus Valley Civilization important sites
• Mohenjodaro ruins were excavated for the first time by R.D.
Banerjee, E. J. H. MacKay and Marshall.
• The Indus Valley cities show a level of sophistication and
advancement not seen in other contemporary civilizations.
• Disposal of the dead was by burial in wooden coffins. Later
on, in the H Symmetry culture, bodies were cremated in urns.

Reasons for Decline of Indus Valley Civilization
• Causes of the decline of this civilization have not been firmly
established. Archaeologists now believe that the civilization did not
come to an abrupt end but gradually declined. People moved
eastwards and cities were abandoned. Writing and trade declined.
• Mortimer Wheeler suggested that Aryan invasion led to the decline
of the Indus Valley. This theory has now been debunked.
• Robert Raikes suggests that tectonic movements and floods caused
the decline.
Reasons for Decline of Indus Valley Civilization
• Lambrick suggests a change in the course of the river Indus caused
its decline.
• Indra is the cause of decline of Indus Valley Civilization by M.
Wheeler.
• Other causes cited include a drying up of the rivers, deforestation
and a destruction of the green cover. It is possible that some cities
were destroyed by floods but not all. It is now accepted that several
factors could have led to the decline of the Indus Valley civilization.
• New cities emerged only about 1400 years later.
Points to learn
• The origin of the Swastika symbol can be traced to the Indus
Valley Civilisation.
• The majority of the scholars believe that the makers of this
civilization were Dravadian.
• Contemporary Civilization of Indus Civilization- Mesopotamia,
Egypt, and China.
Points to learn
• Alexander Cunningham is known as Father of Archeology in India,
• Upper town (High platform): Citadel, Fortified wall to protect from
flood and outsiders for Priest and Administrative officers only.
• Lower town: For merchants, craftsmen, artisans.
• Bricks: mud bricks, burnt bricks, decorated bricks were found only
from Kalibangan, no plastering of wall, excellent drainage system.
• Great bath: Made up with good quality bricks and used only in
ceremonial occasions.
• Great granary: For the storage of grains.
Points to learn
• Knew most metals except Iron, Silver makes it earliest appearance
in IVC.
• Pony tail on Bronze dancing girl statue from Mohenjodaro, knew all
kind of Cosmetics and face paints, ornaments, gold bracelets,
music, dance, dice (found in Harappa), so probably gambling , Chess
like games and Chariot race.
• Wheat, Barley, Cotton was called Sindon by Greeks because Indus
people were first one to cultivate it, especially at Lothal and
Surkotda.
• Weights made up of stones (they were in multiple of 16, 32 etc.).
Points to learn
• Religion: Male and Female both gods are there in this period.
Mother goddess (Fertility), Pashupati Shiva (Mythical, 3 horned
hear) sitting in posture of Yogi surrounded by animals Rhino, tiger,
deer, buffalo, elephant, Pipal trees, Pigeon, Swastik symbol (The
symbol for the first time was found in IVC).
• Disposal of the dead: They had complete burial system. Post
cremation burial, Fractional burial (animal and birds allowed to eat
as much, then bury), Body kept in North-South orientation.
• Script is Boustrophedon (left to right and then right to left and spiral
goes on).

Industrial Policy
• This Policy holds importance in the economy as it was pursued till
the Economic Reforms in 1991.
• Industrial Policy Resolution, 1948
 It declared Indian economy as Mixed Economy
 Small scale industries and cottage industries were given
importance
 Government imposed restriction on foreign investments
Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956
• This policy laid down the basic framework of Industrial Policy.
• This policy is also known as Economic Constitution of India.
• It is classified into three sectors
 Schedule A – which covers Public Sector (17 Industries)
 Schedule B – covering Mixed Sector (i.e. Public & Private) (12
Industries)
 Schedule C – only Private Industries
Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956
• Public Sector
• Small Scale Industry
• Foreign Investment
• This Policy holds importance in the economy as it was pursued till
the Economic Reforms in 1991.
Industrial Policy Statement, 1977
• Focused on Decentralisation
 It gave priority to small scale Industries
 It created a new unit called “Tiny Unit”
 Restrictions on Multinational Companies (MNC) were imposed
Industrial Policy Statement, 1980
• Focus of this was on selective Liberalization
• MRTP Act (Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices), FERA Act
(Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 were introduced.
• The objective was to liberalize industrial sector to increase
industrial productivity and competitiveness of the industrial sector
New Industrial Policy, 1991
• Its Objective was to provide larger role to market forces and to increase
efficiency
• Larger roles were provided by
 L – Liberalization (Reduction of government control)
 P – Privatization (Increasing the role & scope of private sector)
 G – Globalization (Integration of the Indian economy with the world
economy)
• Because of LPG, old domestic firms have to compete with New Domestic firms,
MNC’s and imported items
New Industrial Policy, 1991
• Government allowed Domestic firms to import better technology so as to
improve efficiency and to have access to better technology
• Foreign Direct Investment ceiling was increased from 40% to 51% in
selected sectors.
• Maximum FDI limit is 100% in selected sectors like infrastructure sectors.
• Foreign Investment promotion board was established. It is a single window
FDI clearance agency.
• Technology transfer agreement was allowed under automatic route.
• Phased Manufacturing Programme was a condition on foreign firms to
reduce imported inputs and use domestic inputs, it was abolished in 1991.
New Industrial Policy, 1991
• Public Sector to be Diluted
 Disinvestment
 De-reservations – Industries reserved exclusively for public sector were
reduced
 Professionalization of Management of PSUs
 Sick PSUs to be referred to Board for Industrial and financial restructuring.
(BIFR)
 Scope of MoUs was strengthened.
 MoU is an agreement between a PSU and concerned ministry.
Public Sector
• It can be classified into:-
 Departmental Undertaking – Directly managed by concerned ministry
or department. (e.g. Railways, Posts etc.)
 Non Departmental Undertaking – PSU (e.g. HPCL, IOCL etc.)
 Financial Institution (e.g. SBI, UTI, LIC etc.)
Objectives of setting up PSU were:-
 To create industrial base in the country
 To generate better quality of employment
 To develop basic infrastructure in the country
 To provide resource to the government
 To promote exports and reduce imports
 To reduce inequalities
Public Sector
• Problems of PSUs
 Inappropriate investment decisions
 Pricing Policy
 Excessive overhead cost
 Lack of Autonomy & Accountability
 Overstaffing
 Trade Unionism
 Under Utilization of capacity
PSU Reforms
• New Industrial Policy 1991
• Voluntary Retirement Scheme, 1988 (Golden Handshake)
• Administered Price Mechanism
• Policy of Navratnas (Best performing PSUs were called Navaratnas)
 Government gave them significant degree of autonomy so they can
perform better.
• Policy of Mini Ratnas (Presently 60 PSUs have been granted this status)
• Profitability of PSUs has increased significantly.
PSU Reforms
• Policy of Maharatnas (category created in 2010)
• Three years with an average annual net profit of over Rs. 2500 crore, OR Average annual Net
worth of Rs. 10,000 crore for 3 years, OR Average annual Turnover of Rs. 20,000 crore for 3
years
 PSU must be a Navratna and must be listed in Stock Exchange
 PSU also must have a significant global presence.
• List of Maharatnas
• National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation(ONGC)
• Steel Authority of India Limited(SAIL) Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL)
• Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) Coal India Limited (CIL)
• Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)
DISINVESTMENT
• Disinvestment refers to selling of equity of a PSU to a private sector companies,
financial institutions, general public or workers
Disinvestment versus Privatisation
• Disinvestment refers to selling of equity of a PSU to a private organization or to
general public.
• Privatisation refers to providing for larger role for private capital and enterprise
in the functioning of an economy.
• Privatisation is a wider term than disinvestment. Disinvestment is one of the
means for achieving privatization.
DISINVESTMENT
• Privatisation may result from any of the following:-
 Disinvestment
 Denationalisation (i.e., complete sell off of a PSU)
 Transfer of management and control of a PSU to the private
sector
 Dereservation of areas reserved for the public Sector etc.
Objectives of Disinvestment
• To transfer the resources from non-strategic sector to the strategic sector,
which is much higher on social priority such as basic health, family
welfare, primary education etc.
• To raise funds to cover up the fiscal deficit of the government.
• To improve efficiency of the public sector by inducing private initiative and
competition.
• To enhance accountability of the PSUs by exposing them to the capital
market.
Objectives of Disinvestment
• To reduce political interference by imparting market orientation to the
enterprise.
• Bring down Government equity in all non-strategic PSUs to 26 % or lower,
if necessary.
• Restructure and revive potentially- viable PSUs
• Close down PSUs which cannot be revived
• Fully protect the interest of workers.
The Disinvestment Process
• In 1992, Government constituted a committee on the Disinvestment of
shares in PSE’s headed by Dr. C. Rangarajan to recommend over the policy
of disinvestment.
• The committee recommended that upto 49% equity of the PSUs under the
exclusive participation of the state could be disinvested but for rest of the
industries disinvestment can be allowed upto 74%.
• Further, the government constituted a five member Disinvestment
Commission under the chairmanship of Shri G.V. Ramakrishnan in August
1996 to draw up a comprehensive policy for the long term disinvestment
programme.
• The target for disinvestment is Rs 40,000 crore every year.
SMALL SCALE & COTTAGE INDUSTRIES
• Small Scale Industries are industries in which the investment limit is upto
certain limit which was 1 crore initially 1 crore and now has been
increased to 5 crore
• New Definitions of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
• In accordance with the provision of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises
Development (MSMED) Act, 2006
Medium Enterprises Classification
Manufacturing Sector
Enterprises Investment in plant & machinery
Micro Enterprises Does not exceed twenty five lakh rupees
Small Enterprises More than twenty five lakh rupees but does not
exceed five crore rupees
Medium Enterprises More than five crore rupees but does not exceed ten
crore rupees

Service Sector
Enterprises Investment in equipment
Micro Enterprises Does not exceed ten lakh rupees:
Small Enterprises More than ten lakh rupees but does not exceed two
crore rupees
Medium Enterprises More than two crore rupees but does not exceed five
core rupees
Contribution of Small Scale Industries
• The small scale sector accounts for over 80% of the manufacturing sector's
employment.
• The small-scale accounts for over 34% of the total exports and about 45%
of the manufacturing exports. Further over 90% of exports of the SSIs
consists of non-traditional items like sports goods, readymade garments,
processed foods, chemicals etc.
Problems of Cottage and Small-Scale Industries
1. Non-availability of timely and adequate credit.
2. Inefficient management
3. Lack of infrastructure
4. Technological obsolescence
5. Limited availability of raw materials
6. Marketing problems

NATIONAL MINERAL POLICY (NMP) 2019
• Headed by Mining Ministry, to replace 2008’s policy.
• This is for non-fuel and non-coal minerals
• Allow transfer of mining leases from one company to another, help in their
merger and acquisition
• Grant ‘industry’ status to mining. (so they become eligible for certain tax
benefits / schemes meant for industry sector, if any.)
• R&D, manpower skilling, environmental conservation etc.
• Allowed 100% FDI in mineral exploration
Energy: Electricity
• In India’s present electricity mix consists of:
• Thermal Electricity ( Coal > Gas > Oil) ~64%
• Renewable: Hydroelectricity 13%
• Renewable Energy(Solar, Wind, Biomass etc. except hydro) 21%
• Nuclear ~2%
Electricity → One Nation-One Grid
• Initially, individual states’ electricity grids were interconnected to form 5
regional grid regions namely Northern, Eastern, Western, North Eastern &
Southern region.
• If a state had surplus electricity , it could sell ONLY to other states in that
region.
• So, One Nation-One Grid concept aims to connect all 5 regional grids into
one national grid so, electricity can be transferred from surplus region to
deficient region.
• Here buying-selling of electricity is done through power exchanges like
Power Exchange of India (PXIL) and India Energy Exchange (IEX).
• Headed by Power ministry i.e. Power Grid Corporation of India Limited.
Green Energy Corridor Project
• Headed by Power ministry i.e. Power Grid Corporation of India Limited +
loan support from Asian Development Bank.
• Project will enable the flow of renewable energy into this National Grid
Network.
• So that renewable energy rich States like Rajasthan (solar), Tamil Nadu
(wind) can sell the electricity to other states.
Energy Renewable
• Autonomous bodies :
• 1. National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE)- Gurugram
• 2. National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE)-Chennai
• 3. Sardar Swaran Singh National Institute of Renewable Energy (SSS NIRE)
– Kapurthala
• PSUs :
• 1. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA)- Delhi, MINI
Ratna
• 2. Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI)- Delhi

INTERIOR OF
THE EARTH
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Earth’s Layers
• Earth’s layers are identified by
studying various direct and
indirect sources
• The structure of the earth’s
interior is made up of
several concentric layers.
• Broadly three layers can be
identified—crust, mantle and
the core.
The Crust
• Crust is the outer thin layer with a total
thickness normally between 30-50 km.
• The thickness of the crust varies under
the oceanic and continental areas.
• Oceanic crust is thinner (5-30 km
thick) as compared to the continental
crust (50-70 km thick).
• The continental crust is thicker in the
areas of major mountain systems. It is as
much as 70 -100 km thick in the
Himalayan region.
The Crust
• Mohorovicic (Moho) discontinuity forms the
boundary between crust and
asthenosphere [asthenosphere is a part of mantle].
• The outer covering of the crust is of sedimentary
material (granitic rocks) and below that lie crystalline,
igneous and metamorphic rocks which are acidic in
nature.
• The lower layer of the crust consists of basaltic and ultrabasic rocks.
• The continents are composed of lighter silicates—silica +
aluminium (also called ‘sial’) while the oceans have the
heavier silicates—silica + magnesium (also called ‘sima’).
Mantle
• The mantle extends from Moho’s
discontinuity (35 km) to a depth of 2,900
km (Moho-Discontinuity to the outer core).
• The crust and the uppermost part of the
mantle are called lithosphere. Its thickness
ranges from 10-200 km.
• The lower mantle extends beyond the
asthenosphere. It is in solid state.
• The density increases as we go in the lower
part.
• It is composed of solid rock and magma.
• It forms 83 per cent of the earth’s volume.
Asthenosphere
• The upper portion of the mantle is
called asthenosphere extending up to
400 km.
• It is the main source of magma that
finds its way to the surface during
volcanic eruptions.
Core
• Lies between 2900 km and 6400
km below the earth’s surface.
• Accounts for 16 per cent of the earth’s
volume.
• Core has the heaviest mineral materials
of highest density.
• It is composed of nickel and iron [nife].
• The outer core is liquid while the inner
core is solid.

INTERIOR OF
THE EARTH- Part 2 (Earthquakes)
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Interior of The Earth
• Earth’s interior is essential to understand
the nature of changes that take place over
and below the earth’s surface.
• To understand geophysical phenomenon
like volcanism, earthquakes etc..
• Future deep-sea mineral exploration etc.
• To understand the evolution and present
composition of atmosphere
Sources of information about the interior
• Exogenic as well as endogenic processes are constantly shaping the
landscape.
• Direct Sources
 Deep earth mining and drilling reveals the nature of rocks deep down the
surface.
 Volcanic eruption forms another source of obtaining direct information.
• Indirect Sources
 Depth: With depth, pressure and density increases and hence temperature.
This is mainly due to gravitation.
Seismic waves
• The study of seismic waves provides
a complete picture of the layered
interior.
• Tremors produced by vibratory
waves through rocks of earth mainly
along a fault
• Place of origin is called Focus or
Hypocenter
• Point vertically above focus on earth
surface is called Epicenter. It is the
first one to experience the waves.
• Shock waves travel in all directions
from focus & shaking is maximum at
Epicenter on earth surface
Causes of Earthquakes
• Compressional or tensional stresses built up at the margins
of the huge moving lithospheric plates.
• Sudden release of stress along a fault, or fracture in the
earth’s crust.
• Sudden slipping of rock formations along faults and
fractures in the earth’s crust happen due to constant
change in volume and density of rocks due to intense
temperature and pressure in the earth’s interior.
Human Induced Earthquakes
 Deep mining activities
 Underground nuclear tests
 Reservoir induced seismicity (RIS)
 Extraction of fossil fuels
 Groundwater extraction
Earthquake Waves
• All natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere (depth up to
200 km from the surface of the earth).
• An instrument called ‘seismograph’ records the waves reaching the
surface.
• Earthquake is measured in following scales
• Intensity / Severity of earthquake measured by Mercalli Scale
• Magnitude of earthquake i.e. Energy released at
epicenter measured by Richter scale.
Earthquake Waves
• Earthquake waves are basically of two
types — body waves and surface
waves.
• Body waves are generated due to the
release of energy at the focus and
move in all directions travelling
through the body of the earth. Hence,
the name body waves.
• The body waves interact with the
surface rocks and generate new set of
waves called surface waves. These
waves move along the surface.
Earthquake Waves
There are two types of body waves.
They are called P and S-waves.
And L is called Surface waves
1. ‘P’ waves or primary waves
(longitudinal nature),
2. ‘S’ waves or secondary waves
(transverse in nature) while the
3. ‘L’ waves or surface waves are
long.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• Also called as the longitudinal or
compressional waves.
• Travel in all mediums solid, liquid & gases
with speed of approx. 8 km/s
• Velocity of P waves in Solids > Liquids >
Gases
• Particles of the medium vibrate along the
direction of propagation of the wave.
• P-waves move faster and are the first to
arrive at the surface and are of high
frequency.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• The shadow zone for ‘P’ waves
is an area that corresponds to
an angle between 1030 and
1420
that does not receive any
direct P waves.
• This gives clues about Solid
inner core.
Secondary Waves (S waves)
• Also called as transverse or distortional waves.
• Secondary waves, travel in solids only and not
in liquid with speed of approx. 4 km/s
• S-waves arrive at the surface with some time
lag.
• These waves are of high frequency waves.
• S-waves passing from the mantle to the core
are absorbed because shear waves cannot be
transmitted through liquids.
• The shadow zone for ‘S’ waves led to the
discovery of liquid outer core. Since S waves
cannot travel through liquid, they do not pass
through the liquid outer core.
Surface Waves (L waves)
• Also called as long period waves.
• They are low frequency, long wavelength, and transverse vibration.
• They cause displacement of rocks, and hence, the collapse of
structures occurs.
• These waves are responsible for most the destructive force of
earthquake affect the surface of the Earth only .
• Recoded last on the seismograph.
• P-Waves involve compression and rarefaction of the
material as the wave passes through is but not
rotation.
• S-Waves (S stands for secondary or shear or shake).
Also known as transverse waves, because particle
motions are transverse to the direction of movement
of the wavefront, or perpendicular to the ray. These
waves involve shearing and rotation of the material as
the wave passes through it, but not volume change.
• Rayleigh waves or descriptively called "ground roll" in
exploration seismology. The particle motion of this
wave is confined to a vertical plane containing the
direction of propagation. The particle displacements
are greatest at the surface and decrease exponentially
downward. This wave is similar to how ocean waves
propagate.
Propagation of Earthquake Waves
• P-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. This
exerts pressure on the material in the direction of the
propagation leading to stretching and squeezing of the
material.
• The direction of vibrations of S-waves is perpendicular to
the wave direction in the vertical plane. Hence, they create
troughs and crests in the material through which they pass.
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
• Shallow focus earthquake – Depth ( 0 – 60 Km)
• Medium focus earthquake – Depth (70 – 300 km)
• Deep Focus earthquake – Depth (300 – 700 Km)
• Below 700 km – Not very dangerous
• Shallow focus earthquakes are called crustal earthquakes as they
exist in the earth’s crustal layer.
• Deep focus earthquakes are known as intra plate earthquakes, as
they are triggered off by collision between plates i.e. within the
deeper subduction zones of the earth.
Distribution of Earthquakes
• Around the pacific Ocean along
the belt of volcanoes known as
Ring of Fire. 68 percent of the
volcanoes are experienced in this
region.
• From the middle of Asia
(Himalayas, Caspian Sea) through
the Mediterranean Sea to West
Indies. 21 percent earthquakes
are experienced in the region.
• Mid-Atlantic ridge belt which
accounts for 11 percent of the
earthquake.

INTERIOR OF
THE EARTH
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Interior of The Earth
• The configuration of the surface of the earth is
largely a product of the processes operating in
the interior of the earth.
• Exogenic as well as endogenic processes are
constantly shaping the landscape.
Sources of information about the interior
• Direct Sources
 Deep earth mining and drilling reveals the nature of rocks deep
down the surface.
 Volcanic eruption forms another source of obtaining direct
information.
• Indirect Sources
 Depth: With depth, pressure and density increases and hence
temperature. This is mainly due to gravitation.
Sources of information about the interior
 Gravitation: The gravitation force (g) is not the same at different
latitudes on the surface. It is greater near the poles and less at
the equator. This is because of the distance from the center at
the equator being greater than that at the poles.
 The gravity values also differ according to the mass of material.
The uneven distribution of mass of material within the earth
influences this value. Such a difference is called gravity anomaly.
Gravity anomalies give us information about the distribution of
mass of the material in the crust of the earth.
Sources of information about the interior
 Meteors: Meteors and Earth are solar system objects that
are born from the same nebular cloud. Thus they are likely
to have a similar internal structure.
 Magnetic field: The geodynamo effect helps scientists
understand what’s happening inside the Earth’s core. Shifts
in the magnetic field also provide clues to the inaccessible
iron core. But their source remains a mystery.
What causes the magnetic field of earth?
• Our planet’s magnetic field is believed to be generated deep down in the
Earth’s core.
• Nobody has ever taken the mythical journey to the centre of the Earth, but
by studying the way shockwaves from earthquakes travel through the
planet, physicists have been able to work out its likely structure.
• Right at the heart of the Earth is a solid inner core, two thirds of the size of
the Moon and composed primarily of iron. At a hellish 5,700°C, this iron is
as hot as the Sun’s surface, but the crushing pressure caused by gravity
prevents it from becoming liquid.
What causes the magnetic field of earth?
• Surrounding this is the outer core, a 2,000 km thick layer of
iron, nickel, and small quantities of other metals. Lower
pressure than the inner core means the metal here is fluid.
• Differences in temperature, pressure and composition within
the outer core cause convection currents in the molten metal
as cool, dense matter sinks whilst warm, less dense matter
rises. The Coriolis force, resulting from the Earth’s spin, also
causes swirling whirlpools.
What causes the magnetic field of earth?
• This flow of liquid iron generates electric currents, which in
turn produce magnetic fields. Charged metals passing through
these fields go on to create electric currents of their own, and
so the cycle continues. This self-sustaining loop is known as
the geodynamo.
• The spiraling caused by the Coriolis force means that separate
magnetic fields created are roughly aligned in the same
direction, their combined effect adding up to produce one
vast magnetic field engulfing the planet.
High Levels of Temperature and Pressure Downwards
• Volcanic eruptions and existence of hot springs,
geysers etc. point to an interior which is very hot.
• The high temperatures are attributed to automatic
disintegration of the radioactive substances.
• Gravitation and the diameter of the earth helps in
estimating pressures deep inside.
High Levels of Temperature and Pressure Downwards
Evidence From The Meteorites
• When they fall to earth, their outer layer is burnt during their fall
due to extreme friction and the inner core is exposed.
• The heavy material composition of their cores confirms the similar
composition of the inner core of the earth, as both evolved from
the same star system in the remote past.
• The most important indirect source is seismic activity. The major
understanding of the earth’s internal structure is mainly from the
study of seismic waves.
Evidence From The Meteorites
Seismic waves
• The study of seismic waves provides a complete picture of
the layered interior.
Causes of Earthquakes
• Most earthquakes are causally related to compressional or tensional
stresses built up at the margins of the huge moving lithospheric plates.
• The immediate cause of most shallow earthquakes is the sudden release
of stress along a fault, or fracture in the earth’s crust.
• Sudden slipping of rock formations along faults and fractures in the earth’s
crust happen due to constant change in volume and density of rocks due
to intense temperature and pressure in the earth’s interior.
• Volcanic activity also can cause an earthquake but the earthquakes of
volcanic origin are generally less severe and more limited in extent than
those caused by fracturing of the earth’s crust.
Causes of Earthquakes
• Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones
where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault
lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic
plates that make up Earth’s crust.
• Plate tectonics: Slipping of land along the fault line along,
convergent, divergent and transform boundaries cause
earthquakes. Example: San Andreas Fault is a transform fault where
Pacific plate and North American plate move horizontally relative to
each other causing earthquakes along the fault lines.
Human Induced Earthquakes
• Some earthquakes are human induced. Earthquakes in the reservoir region, mining
sites etc. are human induced.
• Some Earthquake inducing human activities
 Deep mining
 Underground nuclear tests
 Reservoir induced seismicity (RIS)
 Extraction of fossil fuels
 Groundwater extraction
 Artificial induction
 In fluid injection, the slip is thought to be induced by premature release of elastic strain, as in
the case of tectonic earthquakes, after fault surfaces are lubricated by the liquid.
Volcanic Earthquakes
• A separate type of earthquake is associated with volcanic activity
and is called a volcanic earthquake.
• Yet it is likely that even in such cases the disturbance is the result of
a sudden slip of rock masses adjacent to the volcano and the
consequent release of elastic strain energy.
• The stored energy, however, may in part be of hydrodynamic origin
due to heat provided by magma moving in reservoirs beneath the
volcano or to the release of gas under pressure.
Volcanic Earthquakes
• There is a clear correspondence between the geographic distribution of
volcanoes and major earthquakes, particularly in the Circum-Pacific Belt
and along oceanic ridges.
• Volcanic vents, however, are generally several hundred kilometres from
the epicenters of most major shallow earthquakes, and many earthquake
sources occur nowhere near active volcanoes.
• Even in cases where an earthquake’s focus occurs directly below
structures marked by volcanic vents, there is probably no immediate
causal connection between the two activities; most likely both are the
result of the same tectonic processes.
What causes earthquakes?
• Abrupt release of energy along a fault causes earthquake waves.
• A fault is a sharp break in the crustal rock layer.
• Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. But the friction
exerted by the overlying rock strata prevents the movement of rock layer.
With time pressure builds up.
• Under intense pressure, the rock layer, at certain point, overcomes the
friction offered by the overlying layer and undergoes an abrupt movement
generating shockwaves.
• This causes a release of energy, and the energy waves travel in all
directions.
What causes earthquakes?
• The point where the energy is
released is called the focus of an
earthquake, alternatively, it is called
the hypocentre.
• The energy waves travelling in
different directions reach the
surface. The point on the surface,
nearest to the focus, is called
epicentre. It is the first one to
experience the waves. It is a point
directly above the focus.
Causes Earthquakes
• Focus
 The place of origin of an earthquake inside the earth.
• Epicenter
 Point on the earth’s surface vertically above the focus.
 Maximum damage is caused at the epicenter.
• Wave Velocity
 5 to 8 km per second through the outer part of the crust but travel faster with
depth.
• Isoseismic Line
 A line connecting all points on the surface of the earth where the intensity is the
same.
Earthquake Waves
• All natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere (depth up to
200 km from the surface of the earth).
• An instrument called ‘seismograph’ records the waves reaching the
surface.
• Earthquake waves are basically of two types — body waves and
surface waves.
• Body waves are generated due to the release of energy at the focus
and move in all directions travelling through the body of the earth.
Hence, the name body waves.
Earthquake Waves
• The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new
set of waves called surface waves. These waves move along the
surface.
• The velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with
different elasticity (stiffness) (Generally density with few
exceptions). The more elastic the material is, the higher is the
velocity. Their direction also changes as they reflect or refract when
coming across materials with different densities.
• There are two types of body waves. They are called P and S-waves.
Earthquake Waves
Behavior of Earthquake Waves
• The earthquake waves are measured with the help of a seismograph and
are of three types—
1. the ‘P’ waves or primary waves (longitudinal nature),
2. secondary waves or ‘S’ waves (transverse in nature) while the
3. surface waves are long or ‘L’ waves.
• The velocity and direction of the earthquake waves undergo changes
when the medium through which they are travelling changes.
• When an earthquake or underground nuclear test sends shock waves
through the Earth, the cooler areas, which generally are rigid, transmit
these waves at a higher velocity than the hotter areas.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• Also called as the longitudinal or
compressional waves.
• Particles of the medium vibrate
along the direction of propagation
of the wave.
• P-waves move faster and are the
first to arrive at the surface.
• These waves are of high
frequency.
Primary Waves (P waves)
• They can travel in all mediums.
• Velocity of P waves in Solids >
Liquids > Gases
• Their velocity depends on shear
strength or elasticity of the
material.
• The shadow zone for ‘P’ waves is
an area that corresponds to an
angle between 1030 and 1420
• This gives clues about Solid inner
core.
Secondary Waves (S waves)
• Also called as transverse or distortional
waves.
• Analogous to water ripples or light waves.
• S-waves arrive at the surface with some
time lag.
• A secondary wave cannot pass through
liquids or gases.
• These waves are of high frequency waves.
• Travel at varying velocities (proportional to
shear strength) through the solid part of
the Earth’s crust, mantle.
Secondary Waves (S waves)
• The shadow zone of ‘S’ waves extends
almost halfway around the globe from the
earthquake’s focus.
• The shadow zone for ‘S’ waves is an area
that corresponds to an angle between
1030 and 1800
• This observation led to the discovery of
liquid outer core. Since S waves cannot
travel through liquid, they do not pass
through the liquid outer core.
Surface Waves (L waves)
• Also called as long period waves.
• They are low frequency, long wavelength, and transverse vibration.
• Generally affect the surface of the Earth only and die out at smaller depth.
• Develop in the immediate neighborhood of the epicenter.
• They cause displacement of rocks, and hence, the collapse of structures
occurs.
• These waves are responsible for most the destructive force of earthquake.
• Recoded last on the seismograph.
Propagation of Earthquake Waves
• Different types of earthquake waves travel in different manners. As they move or
propagate, they cause vibration in the body of the rocks through which they pass.
• P-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. This exerts pressure on the
material in the direction of the propagation.
• As a result, it creates density differences in the material leading to stretching and
squeezing of the material.
• Other two waves vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
• The direction of vibrations of S-waves is perpendicular to the wave direction in the
vertical plane. Hence, they create troughs and crests in the material through which
they pass.
Emergence of Shadow Zone
• Earthquake waves get recorded in
seismographs located at far off
locations.
• However, there exist some specific
areas where the waves are not
reported. Such a zone is called the
‘shadow zone’.
• The study of different events reveals
that for each earthquake, there
exists an altogether different
shadow zone.
Emergence of Shadow Zone
• It was observed that seismographs located at any distance
within 105 ° from the epicenter, recorded the arrival of both P
and S-waves.
• However, the seismographs located beyond 145 ° from
epicenter, record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of Swaves.
• Thus, a zone between 105 ° and 145 ° from epicenter was
identified as the shadow zone for both the types of waves.
The entire zone beyond 105 ° does not receive S-waves.
Emergence of Shadow Zone
• The shadow zone of S-wave is much
larger than that of the P-waves. The
shadow zone of P-waves appears as
a band around the earth between
105 ° and 145 ° away from the
epicenter.
• The shadow zone of S-waves is not
only larger in extent but it is also a
little over 40 per cent of the earth
surface.
But how these properties of ‘P’ and ‘S’ waves
help in determining the earth’s interior?
• Reflection causes waves to rebound whereas refraction makes
waves move in different directions.
• The variations in the direction of waves are inferred with the help of
their record on seismograph.
• Change in densities greatly varies the wave velocity.
• By observing the changes in velocity, the density of the earth as a
whole can be estimated.
• By the observing the changes in direction of the waves (emergence
of shadow zones), different layers can be identified.
Why does sound wave travel faster in a denser
medium whereas light travels slower?
• Sound is a mechanical wave and travels by compression and
rarefaction of the medium.
• Its velocity in an elastic medium is proportional to the square
root of Tension in the medium.
• A higher density leads to more elasticity in the medium and
hence the ease by which compression and rarefaction can
take place. This way the velocity of sound increases by
increase in density.
Why does sound wave travel faster in a denser
medium whereas light travels slower?
• Light on the other hand is a transverse electromagnetic wave.
• It does not depend on the elastic property of the medium in
which it travels.
• Its velocity in a medium is determined by the electromagnetic
(e.g. dielectric) properties of the medium.
• Effective path length on the other hand is increased by an
increase in the density and hence it leads to higher refractive
index and lower velocity.
Why S-waves cannot travel through liquids?
• S-waves are shear waves, which move particles perpendicularly to their direction
of propagation.
• They can propagate through solid rocks because these rocks have enough shear
strength.
• The shear strength is one of the forces that hold the rock together, and prevent it
from falling into pieces.
• Liquids do not have the same shear strength: that is why, if you take a glass of
water and suddenly remove the glass, the water will not keep its glass shape and
will just flow away.
• In fact, it is just a matter of rigidity: S-waves need a medium rigid enough to
propagate. Hence, S-waves do not propagate through liquids.
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
• Wadati Benioff zone is a zone of subduction along which earthquakes are
common.
• A Wadati–Benioff zone is a zone of seismicity corresponding with the down-going
slab in a subduction zone (Convergent Boundary).
• Differential motion along the zone produces numerous earthquakes.
• Shallow focus earthquakes (most common at submarine ridges. Hardly felt)
• Intermediate focus earthquakes (somewhat severe)
• Deep focus earthquakes (Occurs at trenches – convergent boundary. Very
powerful. Japan lies along trench line. Hence it faces devastating earthquakes).
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
Earthquakes based on the depth of Focus
• Shallow focus earthquakes are called crustal earthquakes as they exist in the
earth’s crustal layer.
• Deep focus earthquakes are known as intra plate earthquakes, as they are
triggered off by collision between plates.
• Shallow-focus earthquakes occur at depths less than 70 km, while deep-focus
earthquakes occur at greater focal depths of 300 – 700 km.
• Shallow focus earthquakes are found within the earth’s outer crustal layer, while
deep focus earthquakes occur within the deeper subduction zones of the earth.
• Shallow focus earthquakes are of smaller magnitudes, of a range 1 to 5, while deep
focus earthquakes are of higher magnitudes, 6 to 8 or more.
Distribution of Earthquakes
• Around the pacific Ocean along the belt of volcanoes
known as Ring of Fire. 68 percent of the volcanoes are
experienced in this region.
• From the middle of Asia (Himalayas, Caspian Sea)
through the Mediterranean Sea to West Indies. 21
percent earthquakes are experienced in the region.
• Mid-Atlantic ridge belt which accounts for 11 percent
of the earthquake.
Distribution of Earthquakes
Effects of Earthquakes
• Earthquakes cause landslides, damming of rivers, depressions which form
lakes.
• They can cause submergence and emergence of landforms along coastal
regions. Example: Coastline of Kutch.
• Lead to change in surface drainage and underground circulation of water.
• More devastating features of earthquakes are fires and seismic waves
(tsunamis).
• Formation of cracks or fissures especially in the region of the epicenter is
common.
Earth’s Layers
• Earth’s layers are identified by studying various direct and
indirect sources [we studied this in previous post: Earth’s
Interior – Earthquake Waves – Shadow Zone].
• The structure of the earth’s interior is made up of
several concentric layers.
• Broadly three layers can be identified—crust, mantle and
the core.
Earth’s Layers
Earth’s Layers
The Crust
• Crust is the outer thin layer with a total thickness normally
between 30-50 km.
• The thickness of the crust varies under the oceanic and continental
areas.
• Oceanic crust is thinner (5-30 km thick) as compared to the
continental crust (50-70 km thick).
• The continental crust is thicker in the areas of major mountain
systems. It is as much as 70 -100 km thick in the Himalayan region.
• It forms 5-1.0 per cent of the earth’s volume.
The Crust
• Mohorovicic (Moho) discontinuity forms the boundary between crust
and asthenosphere [asthenosphere is a part of mantle].
• The outer covering of the crust is of sedimentary material (granitic
rocks) and below that lie crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks
which are acidic in nature.
• The lower layer of the crust consists of basaltic and ultra-basic rocks.
• The continents are composed of lighter silicates—silica + aluminium (also
called ‘sial’) while the oceans have the heavier silicates—silica +
magnesium (also called ‘sima’).
The Crust
Mantle
• The mantle extends from Moho’s discontinuity (35 km) to a depth
of 2,900 km (Moho-Discontinuity to the outer core).
• The crust and the uppermost part of the mantle are called lithosphere. Its
thickness ranges from 10-200 km.
• The lower mantle extends beyond the asthenosphere. It is in solid state.
• The density of mantle varies between 2.9 and 3.3.
• The density ranges from 3.3 to 5.7 in the lower part.
• It is composed of solid rock and magma.
• It forms 83 per cent of the earth’s volume.
• The outer layer of the mantle is partly simatic while the inner layer is
composed of wholly simatic ultra-basic rocks.
Asthenosphere
• The upper portion of the mantle is called
asthenosphere.
• The word astheno means weak.
• It is considered to be extending up to 400 km.
• It is the main source of magma that finds its way to the
surface during volcanic eruptions. It has a density higher
than the crust’s.
Core
• Lies between 2900 km and 6400 km below the earth’s surface.
• Accounts for 16 per cent of the earth’s volume.
• Core has the heaviest mineral materials of highest density.
• It is composed of nickel and iron [nife].
• The outer core is liquid while the inner core is solid.
• A zone of mixed heavy metals + silicates separates the core from
outer layers.
Seismic Discontinuities
Seismic Discontinuities
1. Mohorovicic Discontinuity (Moho) – separates the crust from
the mantle, its average depth being about 35 km.
2. A soft asthenosphere (highly viscous, mechanically weak and
ductile). It’s a part of mantle.
3. Gutenberg Discontinuity – lies between the mantle and the
outer core. Below 2900 km from earth’s surface.

2. Bretton Woods Organizations
• It was held in Bretton Woods town, New Hampshire in USA after
the WW2 (1939-45) to restore the global economy. Total 44 nations
participated, incl. India. It proposed 3 international institutions:
1. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), commonly known as World Bank.
2. International Monetary Fund (IMF).
3. (Proposed) International Trade Organisation (ITO). But could
not materialize due to American opposition. Instead, the
countries later setup GATT and turns into WTO.
Bretton Woods Organizations
• While World bank and IMF are considered “Specialized Agencies of
UN ”, the WTO is considered “Related organization of UN because it
doesn’t fulfill all requirements of UN charter on specialized
agencies.
• BRETTON WOODS → 1) WORLD BANK, WASHINGTON, 1944
• It originally focused on reconstructing war-torn European countries.
After 50s focusing on poor countries of Asia and Africa. World Bank
comprises of 5 institutions.
World Bank Components
• 1) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):
Commonly known as the world bank. Gives development loans with
interest.
• 2) International Development Association (IDA) : Assists the poorest
countries through interest-free long-term loans (Concessional Loans or
soft loans).
• 3) International Finance Corporation (IFC) : supports private enterprise in
developing countries. Known for its Masala Bonds (Masala
bonds are bonds issued outside India but denominated in Indian Rupees,
rather than the local currency.
World Bank Components
• Masala is an Indian word and it means spices. The term was used by the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to evoke the culture and cuisine of
India.)
• 4) Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) : offers (foreign)
investors insurance against
• non-commercial risk (such as political instability, regime change etc.). This
helps 3
rd world nations attract foreign investment.
• 5) International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID): Helps in dispute resolution related to foreign investment / foreign
companies in 3rd world countries.
Voting Power
• In the first four organizations, voting power depends on the share
capital provided by a country. USA highest, followed by various
European giants.
• Fifth is a “dispute settlement” body, so the concept of ‘each
country’s voting power’ does not apply to it.
IMF, WASHINGTON, 1945
• International Monetary Fund helps in global currency exchange
stability, helps against balance of payment crisis.
• Acts as a reservoir of the currencies of all the member countries,
from which a borrower nation can borrow the currency of other
nations- using the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) mechanism.
• World Economic Outlook and 'Global Financial Stability Report' is
prepared by IMF.
• The major difference between IMF and WB is that IMF gives short
term loan and WB gives long term loan to member nations.

Iranian (Persian) &
Macedonian (Greek)
Invasion
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Persian Invasion (550 BC)
• Cyrus, the founder of the Achaemenid
Empire in ancient Iran invaded the
North-Western front of India in 550 BC.
• Contemporary to reign of Bimbisara,
Persian attacked N-W front of India &
Magadha continued to rise in N-E &
Central-north in India
• In N-W front of India, several small
provinces like Kamboja, Gandhara &
Madra did not have a political unity &
continuously fought with each other.
• At that time, Bimbisara of Haryanka
dynasty was ruling over Magadha.
Persian Invasion (550 BC)
• Archaemadian ruler of Iran, Cyrus took
advantage of this political disunity & invaded
west front of India.
• All Indian tribes west of Indus River submitted
to him including Gandhar
• Darius I (4
th persian king), Grandson of Cyprus
conquered Indus valley as a whole & annexed
Punjab & Sindh (N W India)
• Xerxes, Successor of Darius, employed Indian
infantry & cavalry in war against Greece but
got defeated & hence could not move forward
in India. However, control of Persians over
India reduced only after Alexander’s invasion
on India
Effects of Persian Invasion
• Impetus to Indo Iranian
commerce & trade, which finally
became the ground for
Alexander’s invasion. India learnt
the necessity of a strong and
united empire to rebel the
foreign invasions.
• Use of Kharoshti script bought by
Iranian gain popularity in N-W
India & some inscription of
Ashoka (250 BC) are written in
this language (derived from
Aramaic script, written from
right to left)
Effects of Persian Invasion
• Influence of Persian art in India,
Particularly monolithic pillars, &
sculptures found on them along
with inscriptions
• With time a large number of
foreigners, Greek, Persians and
Turks etc. settled down in north
west part of India and
completely absorbs among
Indians.
• Influenced the coinage system in
India because Persian coins were
known for their refined minting
and elegant looks.
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• After 2 centuries of Persian invasion,
Alexander from Macedonia invaded India.
• Alexander (356 BC – 323 BC) was the son
of Philip of Macedonia.
• He became king in 336 BC.
• Alexander had conquered Asia Minor
along with Iran and Iraq. He then
marched into northwest India from Iran.
He had annexed the whole of Persia by
defeating Persian King Darius III in the
Battle of Arbela (330 BC).
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• Alexander was attracted to India’s wealth.
• Alexander believed that on eastern side of
India lies continuation of the sea & hence by
conquering India, he would conquer eastern
boundary of the world
• After conquest of Iran, he marched into India
through Khyber pass 327 BC & crossed Indus in
326 BC.
• In northwest India, just before Alexander’s
invasion, there were many small rulers like
Ambhi of Taxila, and Porus of the region of
Jhelum (Hydaspes).
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• Ambhi accepted Alexander’s sovereignty
but Porus put up a valiant but unsuccessful
fight.
• Alexander was so impressed with Porus’s
fight that he granted him his territory back.
Porus might have accepted lordship. The
battle between him and Porus is called the
Battle of Hydaspes.
• After that, Alexander’s army crossed the
river Chenab and annexed the tribes
between Ravi and Chenab.
• But his army refused to cross the river Beas
and revolted. They were exhausted after
years of battles.
Alexander’s Invasion (327 BC)
• Alexander was forced to retreat in 326 BC. On his way back, he died at Babylon (Mesopotmia/Iraq)
in 323 BC aged 32.
• After his death, the Greek Empire split in 321 BC.
• In northwest India, Alexander left four of his generals in charge of four regions, one of them being
Seleucus I Nicator, who would later trade his territories in the Indus Valley with Chandragupta
Maurya.
• Lysimachus, Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus.
• Lysimachus took Thrace and much of Asia Minor;
• Cassander, Macedonia and Greece;
• Ptolemy seized Egypt, Palestine, Cilicia, Petra, and Cyprus (thus beginnng the Ptolemaic Dynasty
in Egypt which lasted until the death of Cleopatra VII in 31 BCE)
• while Seleucus took control of the rest of Asia (so founding the Seleucid Empire which was
comprised of Syria, Babylon, Persia, and India).
• Eudamas was the last General of Alexander in India.
Effect of Alexander’s Invasion
• First contact b/w Europe & India paved the way for increased
trade & commerce
• Encouraged political unification of India under Mauryas
• Post the invasion there were Indo-Greek rulers in the
northwest part of India.
• Alexander’s authority in Indus valley was short lived because
of expansion of Mauryan Empire under Chandragupta
maurya.
Effect of Alexander’s Invasion
• The invasion led to the establishment of more Greek settlements in this
area. The most important of them were the city of Alexandria in the Kabul
region, Boukephalc on the Jhelum, and Alexandria in Sindh.
• Indirectly this invasion made possibly the establishment of Indo-Bacterian
and Indo-Parthian states, which later stage influenced Indian Architecture
(Gandhara school of sculpture), astronomy, coinage etc.
• The date of the invasion of Alexander is the first reliable date in early
Indian History and considerably helps us in solving chronological
difficulties.

Jainism
Explained By
Dr Vipan Goyal
Jainism
• The freedom of thought allows fermentation of the new ideas and
philosophic principles, leading to the establishment of numerous
religious sects, which had never happened in India before.
• The important landmark in the history of Indian culture was the
evolution of Jainism and Buddhism during the 600 B.C.
• Jainism and Buddhism have greatly influenced the society and
culture of India. They stand against certain aspects of the preexisting system of old ritualistic Vedic tradition.
Jainism
• Ascetic orders and brotherhoods were the basis of both Jainism and
Buddhism explained in their own way.
• Rishabhanath and Aristhanemi are the two Tirthankaras of Jainism
mentioned in Rig Veda that proves the antiquity of Jainism.
• Tirthankaras means the one who shows the right path to anothers.
• Rishabhanath had been mentioned an incarnation of Narayana in
Vayu Purana and Bhagwat Purana.
Jainism
• The nude sculpture of some Tirthanakara was also found at
Harappa.
• Jainism is of ancient origin & believed to have 24
Tirthankaras / Great teachers in their religion
• 1
st one was Rishabdev (Born in Ayodhya, Emblem: Bull) who
is said to have laid the foundation of orderly human society
& realised that the source of Jaina philosophy was Adinath.
Jainism
• The traditions of Jainism say that he was a king and renounced the
kingdom in favor of his son, Bharata, and became an ascetic.
• The name Bharatavarsha is after Bharata, the son of Rishabhanath
as per the Puranic traditions.
• 23rd was Parshavnath (Born in Varanasi, Emblem: Snake) & Last and
24th was Vardhamana Mahavira (Born 540 BC at Kundangrama near
Vaishali, Emblem: Lion)
• All the Tirthankaras were Kshatriyas by birth.

Vardhamana Mahavira
• Mahavira, also known as Vardhamana, Vira, Viraprabhu,
Sanmati, Ativira, Gnatputra (in Tamil Texts) and Nigrantha
Nātaputta (in Pali canon), was 24th Tirthankar of Jainism.
• Mahavira was born about 540 B.C. in the village Kunda-grama
near Vaisali.
• He was the only son of Siddhartha and Trisala.
Vardhamana Mahavira
• Siddhartha was the head of famous kshatriya Jnatrika clan and Trisala was
the sister of Chetaka, an eminent Lichchhavi noble of Vaisali.
• Chetaka's daughter was married to the king of Magadha, Bimbisara.
• Mahavira was married to Yasoda and lived a life of a householder and had
a daughter Anojja or Priyadarsani
• Priyadarsani later married to Jamali, who was also a disciple of Mahavira.
As per Digambara tradition, Mahavira was never married.
Vardhamana Mahavira
• After the death of his parents,
Mahavira left his home at the age of
thirty with the permission of his elder
brother Nandivardan and became an
ascetic.
• In search of truth Mahavira
abandoned the world at the age of
30 & became ascetic & meditated for
12 years practicing austerities.
Vardhamana Mahavira
• After 13 years of penance, he attained the highest spiritual
knowledge called Kevala Jnan.
• He attained this at Jimbhikagrama village under a sal tree
aged 42. This is called Kaivalya.
• Thereafter, he was called Mahavira, Jina, Jitendriya (one who
conquered his senses), Nigrantha (free from all bonds) and
Kevalin.
• He also got the title of Arihant i.e. worthy.
Kaivalya
• One who conquered misery & happiness
• Because of this conquest he is known as Mahavira or great hero or
jina (the conqueror) & his followers Jainas.
• His followers came to be known as Jainas.
• Initially, they were designated as Nirgranthas, which means free
from fetters.
• He propagated religion for 30 years & passed away at the age of 72
at Pavapuri near Rajgir
Kaivalya
• Mahavira gave his first sermon in Prakarit ( ardh-magdhi) language
at Vitulanchal Parbat (in Rajgir, Magdha)
• Jamali became his ist disciple.
• 1st female disciple was Champa who was the daughter of King
Dadivahan.
• The number of chief disciples of Mahavira was 11 and they were
known as Gandhar.
• After the death of mahavira, Sudharman became the first chief of
Jain Sanga.
Causes of the rise of Jainism
• Vedic religion had become highly ritualistic.
• Jainism was taught in Prakrit thus was more accessible
to the common man as compared to Sanskrit.
• It was accessible to people of all castes.
• Varna system had rigidified and people of the lower
castes led miserable lives.
• Jainism offered them an honourable place.
Causes of the rise of Jainism
• About 200 years after the death of Mahavira, a great famine
in the Ganga valley prompted Chandragupta Maurya and
Bhadrabahu (last Acharya of the undivided Jain sangha) to
migrate to Karnataka. Jainism spread to Southern India after
that.
Doctrines of Parsvanath
• Four doctrines of Parsvanath are:
 Non-injury to living beings,
 Speaking the truth,
 Non-possession of property, and
 Not stealing.
• Vardhaman Mahavira accepted four doctrines of Parsvanath and added
Celibacy as a fifth one to them.
• Celibacy is the complete renunciation and free from any possessions.
Mahavira asked his followers to discard even their clothes
Jain’s Mythology
• The universe is eternal.
• The world is not created, maintained, or destroyed by a God, but it
functions through a universal or eternal law.
• Jains did not deny the existence of God, but they simply ignored.
• The existence of the universe is divided into cycles of progress (Utsarpini)
and declines (Avasarpini). It functions through the interaction of living
souls (Jiva) and everything in the universe has a soul.
Jain’s Mythology
• The souls are found not only in the living beings like animals and plants,
but also in stones, rocks, water, etc.
• The purification of the soul is the purpose of living.
• Only the pure soul after being released from the body resides in heaven.
• The soul, which has finally set itself free, rises at once to the top of the
universe, above the highest heaven where it remains in an inactive
omniscient bliss through eternity. It is known as ‘Nirvana’ in the Jainism.
Jain’s Mythology
• According to Jainism, salvation is possible only by:
 Deserting all belongings,
 A long course of fasting,
 Self-mortification,
 Study and
 Meditation
• Jainism, therefore, says that the monastic life is essential for
salvation.
Jain’s Mythology
• According to the Jaina tradition, the king Chandragupta Maurya has
supported Jainism.
• He had accepted Jaina religion and abdicated the throne and died
as a Jaina Bhikshu in the southern part of India.
• Two hundred years after the death of Mahavira (during the reign of
Chandragupta Maurya), a terrible famine broke out in Magadha.
Bhadrabahu was the chief of the Jaina community at that time.
• Bhadrabahu went to Karnataka with his followers and Sthulabhadra
remained in Magadha as the in-charge of Jainism.
Jain’s Mythology
• Bhadrabahu convoked a council at Patliputra, in which the Jaina canon was
arranged.
• Later in the 5th century A.D., the Jaina canon was further rearranged
when the Jainas returned from south India. From where Jainism divided
into two sects.
• Those who returned from southern India held that complete nudity is an
essential part of the teachings of Mahavira while the monks in Magadha
began to put on white clothes.
• Those who put on white robes known as ‘Svetambaras’ (shwetambaras)
and those who were stark naked were called as ‘Digambaras.
Teachings of Jainism
• Mahavira rejected Vedic principles.
• He did not believe in God’s existence.
• According to him, the universe is a product of the natural
phenomenon of cause and effect.
• He believed in Karma and transmigration of the soul. The body dies
but the soul does not.
• One will be punished or rewarded as per one’s karma.
Teachings of Jainism
• Advocated a life of austerity and non-violence.
• Stressed on equality but did not reject the caste system,
unlike Buddhism. But he also said that man may be ‘good’ or
‘bad’ as per his actions and not birth.
• Asceticism was taken to a great length. Starvation, nudity and
self-mortification were expounded.
• Two elements of the world: Jiva (conscious) and Atma
(unconscious).
3 principles of Jainism → Triratnas
• Right faith (believe in teachings & wisdom of Mahavira)
• Right Knowledge (Acceptance of theory that there is no
god & world has been existing without a creator & all
objects possess a soul)
• Right conduct (Refers to observance of 5 great vows)
Doctrines (Panchmahavrata)
• Ahimsa Mahavrata: Don't commit violence, walk, talk and eat
carefully.
• Satya Mahavrata: Don't tell a lie, think before you speak, don't
speak in anger.
• Asteya Mahavrata: Don't steal.
• Aparigraha Mahavrata: Don't acquire property.
• Brahamcharya Mahavrata: Don't talk, see or think about any
women, don't where there are women, take simple food. (added
by Mahavira)
Important Jainism Philosophy -
Anekantavad aka Syadvada
• Most important and fundamental Doctrines of Jainism. It talks
about Pluralism, multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that
truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points
of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.
• Gautam Buddha gave Pratitya Samutpada i.e. there is a
reason behind everything.
• Mahavir rejected authority of Vedas and Vedic rituals.
Anekantavad
• Philosophically an important contribution of Jainism is the doctrine of
Anekantavad (non-absolutism).
• Every living being has a soul. Every soul is potentially divine, with innate
qualities of infinite knowledge, perception, power, and bliss.
• However, these qualities are masked by its karmas.
• Therefore, Jains think of every living being as themselves, harming no one
and be kind to all living beings. This is the basis of non-violence in Jainism.
• Every soul is the architect of its own life, here or hereafter. When a soul is
freed from karmas, it becomes free and attains divine consciousness,
experiencing infinite knowledge, perception, power, and bliss
Non-violence in Jainism
• Ahimsa is such a cardinal principle of Jainism that it is
called beginning and the end of Jain Religion.
• Ahimsa means not to kill or hurt any living being by body,
mind or speech.
• This vrata or vow is possible for only those who dedicate
their whole life on the basis of Mahavratas and who have
renounced their household life.
Non-possession
• Possession of worldly things perpetrates in violence.
• Desire to get more is the root cause of violence and
bondage of soul with karma.
• Thus, non-possession is the second cardinal principle
of Jainism.
Spread of Jainism
• Admitted both women and shudras in its order of followers
• Used prakrit (common language) for preaching instead of sanskrit
• 200 years after the death of Mahavira, there was a serious famine
in Ganga valley.
• Many Jain followers led by Chandragupta Maurya & Bhadrabahu
left for south (Karnataka) & rest stayed back under the leadership of
Sthalbahu. Emmigrants spread Jainism in south India.
• Sthulabahu changed the
code of conduct and said
that white clothes could be
worn. Thus, split Jainism
into two sects:
 Swetambaras: White-clad;
Northerners
 Digambaras: Sky-clad
(naked); Southerners
Jain Councils
• First council
 Held at Pataliputra in the 3rd century BC.
 Presided by Sthulabahu.
• Second Council
 Held at Vallabhi in Gujarat in the 5th century BC.
 Presided by Devardhigani.
 12 Angas were compiled here
Royal patrons of Jainism
• South India
 Kadamba dynasty
 Ganga dynasty
 Amoghavarsha (Rashtrakuta)
 Kumarapala (Chalukya dynasty)
Royal patrons of Jainism
• North India
 Bimbisara
 Ajatasatru
 Chandragupta Maurya
 Bindusara
 Kharavela
Chalukyans / Solankis are the last great patrons of Jainism.
Royal Patrons of Jainism
• Asoka’s Grandson Samprati
• King Kharvela of Orissa: set up jain rock cut cave
(Hathigumpha, Baghagumpha, Udaigiri and Khandagiri caves)
• Gangs, Kadambs, Chalukyas, Rastrakutas had patronized
Jainism.
• King Amoghavarsha of Rastrakuta dynasty became a Jain
Monk.
Royal Patrons of Jainism
• The Chalukyan period rock cut caves at badami/KTK and
aihole/KTK have the figures of Jain Tirthankaras.
• Samatabhadra in Kanchi/TN preached this religion.
• The Dilwara Jain temples (Vimalavashi, Tejpala temples) at
Mount Abu/Rajasthan were built by Chalukya Dynasty kings
• Statue of Gometeshwara/ Bahubali- Sharavanvelgola
(Karnataka) belongs to Jains
Contribution of Jainism
• 1
st serious attempt to mitigate evil of varna system &
ritualistic vedic system
• Adoption of Prakrit by Jainas helped in its growth & many
regional languages grew out of Prakrit especially Shauraseni,
out of which Marathi grew.
• Jainism religious literature is written in “Ardhamagadhi” & text
were finally compiled at Valabhi (Gujrat)
Jain Texts
• Jain texts are known as Aagham.
• In this 12 angas, 12 upangas, 10 prakiranan, 6
chedsutra, 4 mulasutra included.
• Jain Texts were written in ArdhMagdhi language.
• Premya-Kamatarand by PrabhaChandra
• Kalpasutras in Sanskrit by Bhadrabahu
• Parishishta Parvan by HemaChandra

Karst Landforms
By Dr Vipan
Goyal

Karst Landforms
• Karst topography is a landscape
formed from the dissolution of
soluble rocks such as limestone,
dolomite, and gypsum.
• It is characterized by underground
drainage systems
with sinkholes, caves etc..
• It is so named after a province
of Yugoslavia on the Adriatic
sea coast where such formations are
most noticeable.
Conditions for the formation of Karst Topography
• A region with a large stretch of watersoluble rocks such as limestone at the
surface or sub-surface level
• Limestones should not be porous
• These rocks should be dense, thinly
bedded and well jointed
• A perennial source of water and a low
water table to allow the formation of
conspicuous features.
• Moderate to abundant rainfall to cause
the solvent action of water i.e. solution
of rocks
Mechanism of erosion in Karst region
• In Karst regions, rocks are permeable, thinly bedded
and highly jointed and cracked.
• Thus there is the general absence of surface
drainage as the surface water has gone
underground
• After vertically going down to some depth, the
water under the ground flows horizontally through
the bedding planes, joints or through the materials
themselves.
• Rocks are eroded due to this downward and
horizontal movement of water.
• It is through the chemical process of solution and
precipitation deposition by surface water and
groundwater, varieties of landforms are developed
in rocks like limestones or dolomites rich in calcium
carbonate.
Erosional Landforms
• Caves
• This is an underground cave formed by water
action by various methods in a limestone or
chalk area.
• Cave formation is prominent in areas where
there are alternating beds of rocks (sandstone,
shale, quartzite) with limestone or dolomite in
between or in areas where limestones are
dense, massive and occurring as thick beds.
• Water percolates down either through the
materials or through cracks and joints and
moves horizontally along bedding planes.
• Gradually, the limestone dissolves along these
bedding planes resulting in the creation of long
and narrow gaps called caves.
Arch/Natural Bridge
When a part of the cavern
collapses the portion
which keeps standing
forms an arch.
Sink Hole/Swallow Hole
• These holes are developed by enlargement of the cracks found in such
rocks, as a result of continuous solvent action of the rainwater.
• The surface streams which sink disappear underground through swallow
holes.
• Small to medium-sized round to sub-rounded shallow depressions called
swallow holes form on the surface of limestones through solution where
rainwater sinks into the limestone at a point of weakness
• They are also known as sinkholes
• Sinkholes are a common feature in limestone/karst areas.
• A sinkhole is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped
towards the bottom
• There is a great variation in sizes of Sinkholes with areas from a few sq. m
to a hectare and with depth from a less than half a metre to thirty metres
or more.
• These holes grow in size through continuous solvent action
• They are also referred to as solution sinks
Karst Window
• When a number of adjoining sink holes
collapse, they form an open, broad area
called a karst window.
Sinking Creeks/Bogas
• In a valley, the water often
gets lost through cracks and
fissures in the bed.
• These are called sinking
creeks, and if their tops are
open, they are called bogas.
Doline
• They are also referred to as Collapse
sinks .
• They are less common than sinkholes
• They might start as solution forms first,
and if the bottom of a sinkhole forms
the roof of a void or cave underground,
it might collapse leaving a large hole
opening into a cave or a void below
Uvalas
• They are long, narrow to wide
trenches, also referred to as Valley
sinks .
• Several sinkholes and dolines may
merge together as a result of
subsidence to form a large
depression called an Uvala.
Polje
• A polje is a very large, flat-floored depression in
the karst region.
• They are often formed by merging of several
uvalas or partly due to faulting
• They are commonly found in subtropical and
tropical latitudes
• If the streams lose themselves in these valleys,
then these are called blind valleys.
• During the rainy season, parts of the floor which
are at or near the water table may become
temporary lakes
• Drier areas are fertile. Usually covered with thick
sediments, they are used extensively for
agricultural purposes
Ponor
• A ponor is a natural surface
opening in the karst regions.
• They are found directly
underneath the sinkholes.
• A ponor is kind of a portal where
a surface stream or lake flows
either partially or completely
underground into a karst
groundwater system.
Limestone Pavements
• A limestone pavement is a natural
karst landform consisting of a flat,
incised surface of exposed limestone
that resembles an artificial
pavement.
• These are formed by the solvent
action of underground water in the
limestones, causing progressive
widening and enlargement of joints
and cracks in the trenches.
• The enlarged joints are called grikes
and the isolated, rectangular blocks
are termed as clints.
Landforms due to depositions
• Depositional landforms in karst region are developed due to
the deposition of calcium carbonate.
• The calcium carbonate dissolved during the erosional process
starts to precipitate when the water evaporates.
• Stalactites, Stalagmites and Pillars are the most spectacular
underground features, found in the limestone caves.
Stalactites
• Stalactites are the sharp, slender,
downward-growing structures of
different diameters that hang from
the cave roofs.
• Stalactites have a variety of forms
• Their bases are normally broad
which taper towards the free ends
• The water carries calcium in
solution and when this limecharged water evaporates, it leaves
behind the solidified crystalline
calcium carbonate.
Stalagmites
• Stalagmites form due to dripping
water from the surface or through
the thin pipe, of the stalactite,
immediately below it
• Moisture dripping from the roof
trickles down the stalactite and
drops to the floor where
stalagmites are formed due to
deposition of calcium
• Stalagmites may take the shape of
a column, a disc, with either a
smooth, rounded bulging end or a
miniature crater-like depression.
Stalactite and Stalagmite
Pillars
• Over a long period, the stalactite
is eventually merged with the
stalagmite
• Thus, the pillars or columns of
different diameters are formed.

Kinematics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Kinematics
Kinematics is branch of mechanics
which deals with the study of
motion of the objects without
taking into account the cause of
their motion.
Rest and Motion
• An object is said to be at rest if it does not change its position which
respect to its surroundings with time and said to be in motion if it
changes its position with respect to its surrounding with time.
• Rectilinear or Translatory motion : When a body moves along a
straight path e.g. moving car on horizontal road, motion under
gravity etc.
• Angular motion such as particle going on a circle, projectile motion,
rotation of machine shaft etc.
Rest and Motion
• Rotational motion or circular motion such as motion of a fan.
• Circular motion : When a body moves in a circular path.
• Rotatory motion : When a body spins about its own axis.
• It an object travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, then it
is said to be in uniform motion.
• It an object travels unequal distances in equal intervals of time,
then it is said to be in non-uniform motion.
• Oscillatory and vibratory motion :When a body moves to and
fro or back and forth repeatedly a fixed point in a definite
interval of time, it is said to be in oscillatory motion.
• Amplitude : The extent to which the body moves on either
side of a fixed point.
• Vibratory motion : The oscillatory motion, where the
amplitude is very small.
One, Two and Three Dimensional Motion
• 1-D Motion (motion in a line) : when position of an object
changes only along one axis.
• 2-D Motion (Motion in a plane) : When position of an object
changes along any two axis. e.g. motion of a planet around a
sun.
• 3-D Motion (Motion in a space) : When position of an object
changes in all 3 axes.
Speed
• The distance covered by a moving body in a unit time interval is called its
speed.
• Speed = Distance travelled/ Time taken
• When a body travels equal distances with speed 𝑣1 and 𝑣2, then average
speed is the harmonic mean of the two speeds.
2/v = 1/v1 + 1/v2 = v = 2v1v2 / v1+v2
• When a body travels for equal times with speeds 𝑣1 and 𝑣2, then average
speed is the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.
v= v1+v2/ 2
Velocity
• The time rate of change of displacement of a body is called its
velocity.
• Velocity = Displacement/ Time
• An object is said to be moving with uniform velocity if it undergoes
equal displacements in equal intervals of time.
• An object is said to be moving with non-uniform or variable
velocity if it undergoes unequal displacement in equal intervals of
time.
• Average velocity = Time displacement / Total time taken
• Average velocity : Vavg = (u+v)/2
• Relative velocity :
• = Va + Vb ( if two bodies a and b travel in opposite direction)
• = Va - Vb ( if two bodies a and b travel in same direction)
Acceleration
• The time rate of change of velocity of a body is called its acceleration.
• Acceleration = Change in velocity / Time taken
• It is a vector quantity and its SI unit is 𝑚𝑠−2.
• Acceleration at an instant of time is known as instantaneous acceleration.
• When the velocity of a body increases with time, then its acceleration is
positive and if velocity decreases with time, then its acceleration is
negative called deceleration or retardation.
• If acceleration does not change with time, it is said to be constant
acceleration.
Equations of Motions
• If a body started its motion with initial velocity u and attains final velocity
v in the interval t. The acceleration assumed to be uniform in motion is a
and the distance travelled is s, then equations of motion:
𝑣 = 𝑢 + 𝑎𝑡
𝑠 = 𝑢𝑡 + ½ 𝑎𝑡2
𝑣2 = 𝑢2 + 2𝑎𝑠
• If any body is falling freely under gravity, then a is replaced by g in above
equations.
• If an object is thrown vertically upward, then in above equations of motion
a is replaced by (–g).
• A time period (denoted by 'T' ) is
the time taken for one complete cycle of
vibration to pass a given point.
• As the frequency of a wave increases,
the time period of the wave decreases.
The unit for time period is 'seconds‘.
• Frequency is the number of occurrences
of a repeating event per unit of time.
• Angular displacement : The angular
displacement is defined as the angle through
which an object moves on a circular path.
• It is the angle, in radians, between the initial
and final positions. (θf
- θi
)
• = angular displacement. θ = s/r.
• SI unit is radian.
• Angular velocity : rate of change of angular
position of a rotating body.
• ω = dθ / dt
• Angular acceleration, also called rotational acceleration, is a
quantitative expression of the change in angular velocity that
a spinning object undergoes per unit time.
• SI unit is radian/sec2
Projectile Motion
• When a body is thrown from horizontal making an angle (θ) except
90°
, then its motion under gravity is a curved parabolic path, called
trajectory and its motion is called projectile motion.
• Examples:
 The motion of a bullet shot from the gun
 The motion of a rocket after burn-out
 The motion of a bomb dropped from a aeroplane etc.
Projectile Motion
• Properties of Projectile Motion
• If we drop a ball from a height and at the same time thrown
another ball in a horizontal direction, then both the balls would
strike the earth simultaneously at different places.



Circular Motion
• The motion of an object along a circular path is called circular motion.
• Circular motion with a constant speed is called uniform circular motion.
• The direction of motion at any point in circular motion is given by the
tangent to the circle at that point.
• In uniform circular motion, the velocity and acceleration both changes.
• In case of non-uniform circular motion, the speed changes from point to
point on the circular track.
• Centripetal Acceleration
 During circular motion an acceleration acts on the body towards the
centre, called centripetal acceleration. The direction of centripetal
acceleration is always towards the centre of the circular path.
• Force
 It is an external push or pull with can change or tries to change the
state of rest or of uniform motion. SI unit is newton (N) and CGS unit is
dyne. 1 N = 105 dyne.
 If sum of all the forces acting on a body is zero, then body is said to be
in equilibrium.
• Centripetal Force
 During circular motion a force always acts on the body towards
the centre of the circular path, called centripetal force.
 F=mv2/r=mω2r.
• Centrifugal Force
 In circular motion we experience that a force is acting on us in
opposite to the direction of centripetal force called centrifugal
force. This is an apparent force or imaginary force and also
called a pseudo force.
Applications of centripetal and centrifugal forces
• Cyclist inclined itself from vertical to obtain required centripetal
force. To take a safe turn cyclist slower down his speed and moves
on a path of larger radius.
• Roads are banked at turns to provide required centripetal force for
taking a turn.
• For taking turn on a curved road, the frictional force is acting
between the tyres of the vehicle and the road acts as centripetal
force.
Applications of centripetal and centrifugal forces
• If a bucket containing water is revolved fast in a vertical plane, the
water may not fall even when bucket is completely inverted
because a centrifugal force equal or greater than the weight of
water pushes the water to the bottom of the bucket.
• For orbital motion of electrons around the nucleus electrostatic
force of attraction is acting between the electrons and the nucleus
as centripetal force.
Applications of centripetal and centrifugal forces
• Cream is separated from milk when it is rotated in a vessel about
the same axis. During rotation lighter particles of cream experience
a lesser force than the heavier particles of milk.
• For revolution of the earth around the sun, gravitational force of
attraction between the earth and the sun acts as centripetal force.

Lakes of the World
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Lakes
• A lake is a body of water of considerable size, localized in a basin, that is
surrounded by land apart from a river or other outlet that serves to feed
or drain the lake.
• Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and
areas with ongoing glaciation.
• Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or
stream, which maintain a lake’s average level by allowing the drainage of
excess water
• Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by
evaporation or underground seepage or both. They are termed endorheic
lakes.
• The majority of lakes on Earth are fresh water, and most lie in the
Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes. Canada, Finland and Siberia
contain most of the fresh water lakes
Classification of Lakes
• Temporary lakes
 Lakes may exist temporarily filling up the small depressions of undulating ground
after a heavy shower.
 In this kind of lakes, Evaporation is greater than Precipitation. Example: Small lakes
of deserts.
• Permanent lakes
 In this kind of lakes, precipitation is greater than evaporation.
 Example: Great Lakes of North America, East African Rift Lakes.
• Fresh water lakes
 Most of the lakes in the world are fresh-water lakes fed by rivers and without
flowing streams e.g. Great Lakes of North America.
Classification of Lakes
• Saline lakes
 Salt lakes is an inland body of water situated in an arid or
semiarid region, having no outlet to the sea, and containing a
high concentration of dissolved salt.
 These lakes exist in regions of low precipitation and intense
evaporation. Because of intense evaporation, the concentration
of salts increases in the water body, turning them saline.
Example - Great Salt Lake of Utah, USA, Dead Sea etc.
Lakes Formed by Earth Movement
• Tectonic lakes
 Due to the warping (simple deformation),
subsidence (sliding downwards), bending
and fracturing (splitting) of the earth’s
crust, tectonic depressions occur.
 Such depressions give rise to lakes of
immense sizes and depths.
 They include Lake Titicaca, and
the Caspian Sea.
Lakes Formed by Earth Movement
• Rift valley lakes
• A rift valley is formed when two blocks of earth move
apart letting the ‘in between’ block slide downwards.
Or, it’s a sunken land between two parallel faults.
• These lakes include some of the oldest, deepest and
largest lakes around the globe.
• Due to faulting, a rift valley is formed by the sinking of
the land between two parallel faults, deep, narrow and
elongated in character.
• Water is collected in these troughs
• Often their floors are below sea level.
• The best example of this is the East African Rift Valley
which includes such lakes as Lake Tanganyika and the
Dead Sea etc.
Lakes Formed by Glaciation
• Cirque lakes or tarns
• A glacier on its way down the valley leaves behind
circular hollows.
• These circular hollows, in the heads of the valley up in
the mountain, are called cirques.
• Cirque is a hollow basin cut into a mountain ridge. It
has steep sided slope on three sides, an open end on
one side and a flat bottom.
• When the ice melts, the cirque may develop into a tarn
lake.
• They are also called as Ribbon lakes
• Example Red tarn in the English Lake District and
Chandra Taal (Himachal Pradesh) in India
Lakes Formed by Glaciation
• Rock-hollow lakes
• These lakes are formed by ice scouring when valley glaciers or ice sheets
scoop out hollows or depressions on the surface
• Such lakes are abundant in Finland
• Two more types of a glacial lake are formed due to damming up of valleys
by morainic debris deposited by valley glaciers and deposition of glacial
drifts in glaciated lowlands .
Lakes Formed by Volcanic Activity
• Crater and Caldera Lakes
• A natural hollow called a crater is formed by blowing off
of the top of the cone during a volcanic explosion.
• Crater may be widened and enlarged by further
subsidence into a caldera.
• In dormant or extinct volcanoes, due to rainfall straight
into these depressions which have no superficial outlet,
a crater or caldera lake is formed.
• Examples Lonar crater lake in Maharashtra, India, Crater
Lake in Oregon, USA and Lake Toba in Sumatra etc.
Lakes Formed by Volcanic Activity
• Lava-blocked Lakes
• In volcanic regions, it is common to find a stream
of lava that flows across a valley
• This stream of lava may occasionally become
solidified and block the valley thus forming a lake
basin
• This basin may get filled up due damming up of the
river due to solidified lava.
• Example The Sea of Galilee which is an inland lake
was created due to blocking of the Jordan valley by
lava flow
Lakes Formed by Erosion
• Karst lakes
• Karst lakes are formed in
depressions, carved out by solvent
action of rainwater on water-soluble
rocks such as limestone, gypsum and
dolomite.
• The collapse of limestone roofs of
underground caves may result in the
exposure of long, narrow lakes that
were once underground.
Lakes Formed by Erosion
• Wind-deflated lakes
 The winds in deserts creates hollows.
 These may reach ground water which seeps out forming small, shallow lakes.
 Excessive evaporation causes these to become salt lakes and playas.
 Example: Great Basin of Utah, U.S.A.
Lakes Formed by Deposition
• Lakes due to river deposits
 During a flood, a river may shorten its course by cutting across its meandering
loops, leaving behind a horse-shoe shaped channel as an ox-bow lake
 e.g. those that occur on the flood-plains of Lower Mississippi, Lower Ganges, USA
and Rio Grande (Mexico), Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary in Bihar, etc..
• Lakes due to Marine deposits
 Also called Lagoons. (shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water
by barrier islands or reefs. )
 Example: Lake Chilka
Lakes Formed by Deposition
• Lakes due to damming of water
 Lakes formed by these processes are also known as barrier lakes.
Landslides, avalanches may block valleys so that rivers are dammed.
Such lakes are short-lived.
 Example: Lakes that are formed in Shiwaliks (Outer Himalayas).
Dehradun (all Duns) were lakes few centuries ago.
Man-made lakes
• Artificial lakes
• Besides natural lakes, man has now
created artificial lakes
• Artificial lakes are created by erecting a
concrete dam across a river valley
• These dams help in creating a reservoir
by impounding river water
• Guru Gobind Sagar Lake which supports
the Bhakra Nangal Hydel Project is an
example of an artificial lake in India

Introduction
• Land under settlements (i.e. rural and urban), infrastructure (i.e. roads,
canals, industries, shops, etc.) are kept under the category of NonAgricultural Land.
• Barren hilly terrains, desert lands, ravines, etc. normally are not suitable
for cultivation, hence, they are known as Barren and Wastelands.
• Any land, which is left fallow (uncultivated) for more than five years is
categorized as Cultivable land.
Introduction
• The land, which is left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural
year is known as Current Fallow.
• The physical extent of the land on which crops are sown and harvested is
known as Net Sown Area.
• Land use pattern changes with time and the nature of economic activities
carried out in that region. As a result of increase in population, change in
income levels, available technology, and associated factors, pressure on land
increases and marginal lands come under use.
Introduction
• When secondary and tertiary sectors grow much faster than primary
sector, then agricultural land changes into non-agricultural land.
• Because of the changing structure of the Indian economy, the rate of
increase of non-agricultural land is very fast.
Grouping of Minerals
On the basis of chemical and physical properties,
minerals are grouped as:
Metallic minerals
Non-metallic minerals
• Metallic minerals are further sub-divided as ferrous and nonferrous metallic minerals
• The minerals containing iron is known as ferrous and without iron
is known as non-ferrous (copper, bauxite etc)
• Depending upon the origination, non-metallic minerals are either
organic (such as fossil fuels also known as mineral fuels, which are
derived from the buried animal and plant)
• Minerals are unevenly distributed on the earth’s surface
• All minerals are exhaustible in nature

• This Ammonia (NH3
) can be used for making nitrogen based
fertilizers e.g. Urea
• Similarly, Neptha (obtained from crude oil) is also used in
production of nitrogen based fertilizers, hence proximity to oil
refinery is also considered a favourable factor.

Problems in Middle east
Wastage of energy resources
Electricity in India
Thermal
Hydro Wind
Nuclear
Thermal Energy
• 67 % of total energy production
• Generated by using fossil fuels (Coal, Petroleum, Natural gas)
• No Geological conditions required
• Limited reserves, Rising demands (cost) & non – ecofriendly
• Largest Producer → Maharashtra
• To boost Thermal power production gov. has promoted Ultra
Mega Power Projects (4000 MW & above)
Hydroelectricity
• 18 % of total energy production
• Eco-friendly, Clean & Renewable
• Small hydel power projects < 25 MW are counted under New
renewable energy sources
• Largest Producer → Andhra Pradesh
Nuclear Energy
• 26 % of total energy production

the Singbhum Copper belt.
• Other important uranium reserve regions are also found in Udaipur, Alwar,
and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan; Durg district of Chhattisgarh;
Bhandara district of Maharashtra; and Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh.
Nuclear Energy
• Palakkad and Kollam districts of Kerala have the world’s largest monazite
deposits
• Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1948 and the Atomic
Energy Institute at Trombay was founded in 1954.
• However, the Atomic Energy Institute at Trombay was renamed as Bhabha
Atomic Research Centre in 1967.
• The important nuclear power projects are located at Tarapur
(Maharashtra); Rawatbhata near Kota (Rajasthan); Kalpakkam (Tamil
Nadu); Narora (Uttar Pradesh); Kaiga (Karnataka); and Kakarapara
(Gujarat).
Wind Energy
Non-conventional Renewable source of energy
Largest Producer → Tamil Nadu
High cost as compared to the efficiency of power generated
Nagercoil (TN) and Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) are well known for
effective use of wind energy in the country
Solar Energy
• Non-conventional Renewable source of energy
• Thermal + Photovoltaic → Sunlight to energy
• High cost as compared to the efficiency of power generated
• India plans to generate 100GW of solar energy by 2022
• The largest solar plant of India is located at Madhavpur, near
Bhuj, where solar energy is used to sterilise milk cans.
Solar Energy
• The western part of India has greater potential for the
development of solar energy.
• The Ministry of Non-conventional Sources of Energy is
responsible for the development of wind energy in
India as the major source of renewable energy.
Bio Energy
• Bio-energy is the energy derived usually from the biological
products, such as agricultural residues and other bio-waste.
• Bio-energy can be converted into electrical energy, heat
energy, and gas for cooking.
• Okhla in Delhi presents a good example by producing bio
energy from municipal waste.
Bio Gas
• Converted into energy by direct combustion or by conversion of
such wastages into alcohol, methane, or other storage fuels
• Provides pollution-free energy
• Cheaper than most of the common fuels
• The residue can be used as manure
• Has higher thermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene, cow dung,
coal and charcoal
Tidal Energy
• Non-conventional Renewable source of energy
• Oceanic tides can be used to generate electricity.
• In India, the Gulf of Kutch, provides ideal conditions for utilising
tidal energy.
• Ocean currents are the store-house of infinite energy. Hence, India
has great potential for the development of tidal energy.
Geo Thermal Energy
• Refers to the heat and electricity produced by using the heat from the interior
of the Earth
• Exists because, the Earth grows progressively hotter with increasing depth
• Groundwater in such areas absorbs heat from the rocks and becomes hot.
• It is so hot that when it rises to the earth’s surface, it turns into steam.
• This steam is used to drive turbines and generate electricity.
• Parvati valley near Manikarn in Himachal Pradesh and Puga Valley, Ladakh

(Industries,Nuclear Reactors
and MPPs)
By Dr Vipan
Goyal
India: Industry
Primary Industries
Use natural raw material
Examples → Hunting-gathering, pastoral activities, fishing,
forestry, agriculture, mining and quarrying
Secondary Industries
• Make complex products using the material obtained from
primary industry
• Secondary Industry can be sub classified into
• Heavy Industries → Engineering, metal goods, heavy
chemicals, shipbuilding, locomotives
• Light industries → Electronics, plastic, textile, cosmetic etc.
Tertiary Industries
Not a branch of manufacturing but sells the product of primary and
secondary industries via transport, trading, wholesale & retailing
Basically include Service providers industry
Provides services such as tourism, education, entertainment,
advertisements, consultancy, Administration, healthcare etc.
Factors responsible for the location of Industries
Availability of Raw Material
Power Resources
Availability of water
Labor
Transportation
Availability of Market
Capital
Government Policies
Need for Industrialization in India
To reduce dependence on the other countries and become self sufficient
To maintain the balance of trade
To accelerate the economic growth
To solve the problem of unemployment
Industries polluting the environment
Emitting Harmful Effluents and Smoke into the Air
Discharging Large Quantities of Chemical Waste and Garbage
Degradation of fertile Land
Contamination of Underground Water
Solutions
• Use of Hydro-Electricity instead of thermal power
• Use of Higher Quality Coal for Thermal Plants emitting less smoke
• Shifting of Factories out of Municipal Limits
• Discharging dirty water & smoke only after treatment
• Recycling of industrial Water
• Enacting Stringent Laws for checking Pollution and Degradation of
the Environment
• Planting of Trees and Creating Mini-Forest Areas by Industry owners
Timber industry
Near raw material
Dependent on bamboo, softwood
E.g. South Gujarat, Odisha, MP
Near market
Kolkata → Raw material brought from North Eastern
States, cheap labor, coal, water available
Fishing in India
In India, fishing is more developed along western coast than in
Eastern coast because
• Continental shelf in Western Coast are wider so they
have more plankton and results in more fishes
• Commercial varieties like Prawns are mostly confined along
western coast.
Cotton and Textile Industry
location :
• nearness to market
• nearness to water body (for dyeing, bleaching)
• Energy to run power looms and textile machines
• cheap labour supply & availability of capital/finance
Climate as factor for cotton factories
• In dry climate, the cotton-threads will break quickly during spinning.
• In humid climate, thread will rarely break.
• So, cotton textiles were setup near coastal areas.
• Today we have humidifiers that can artificially increase the airmoisture in factory/work-shed so we can setup factory anywhere,
run it efficiently, irrespective of climate outside.
Cotton Industry locations in India
• Tamil Nadu has the largest number of cotton
textiles in India
Maharashtra (Mumbai – Cottonopolish of India)
Ahmadabad (Gujarat)
Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) Manchester of South India
Silk Industry
• India grows all important varieties of silk viz. Mulberry, Tasar, Oak Tasar, Eri
and Muga
• But demand is greater than production, so even we have to import from
china (particularly mulberry silk)
• Mulberry silk concentrated Mainly in Southern states (Karnataka, Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh) + WB + J & K
• Non – Mulberry states Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha + North East
• Location of silk Industry is governed by 2 factors- prevalence of sericulture
practices and availability of skilled labour.
• Karnataka is leading producer followed by West Bengal and Bihar.
Geographical Factors
• Raw material (Mulberry plants) can be grown in any type of
soil even in forest fringes, hill slopes
• Works well in non-green revolution, non-irrigated areas of
East and NE India
• In Eastern States, Farmers earlier used to grow Jute but Jute
demand declined so they shifted to Sericulture
Woolen Industry
• Market
 Winter in North India → brutally cold hence good demand
 ~75% of industries concentrated in Northern States
because of market factor
 Parallel to wool-market factor, you can see that Cotton
textile industry is profound in southern half of India
because warm-humid climate hence more demand for
Cotton garments in south India than woolen
Indian woolen textile regions
Jute Industry
• India manufactures the largest quantity of jute
goods in the world.
• Mainly located in West Bengal followed by
Andra Pradesh, Bihar, UP and MP.
• After independence most of the jute-producing areas went to
Bangladesh resulting in acute shortage of raw jute (raw material
required for Jute production)
• Indian Jute industry is facing very stiff competition from other jute
producing countries viz. Bangladesh, Philippines, Japan and Brazil
Viticulture
• winegrowing (wine growing) is the cultivation
and harvesting of grapes.
• Himachal, Nashik and Bangalore.
Rubber Plantations
• Natural Rubber is obtained from latex of
rubber trees
• Latex is white milky liquid, collected by
making cut on rubber tree bark
• Latex contains 30-40% rubber

Land Revenue Systems
Before British Rule
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Land Revenue Systems Before British Rule
• Tax from the land was a major source of revenue for the kings and
emperors from ancient times.
• But the ownership pattern of land had witnessed changes over
centuries.
• During Kingship, land was divided into Jagirs, Jagirs were alloted
to Jagirdars, these Jagirdars split the land they got and allocated to
sub-ordinate Zamindars.
• Zamindars made peasants cultivate the land, in-return collected
part of their revenue as tax.
Land Revenue Systems in British India
• Three major systems of land revenue collection existed in
India.
• They were
1. Zaminidari,
2. Ryotwari and
3. Mahalwari.
Permanent Settlement/Zamindari System
• It was initiated by Governor General Lord Cornwallis on the
recommendations of John Shore.
• It was implemented in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Banaras of
UP and North Karnataka
• It was implemented in 19% of the British areas.
• Cornwallis termed zamindars as the real owners of the land
• It was started only for a temporary period of 10 years in 1790, however
this system was made permanent in 1793
Permanent Settlement/Zamindari System
• The realized amount would be divided into 11 parts.
• 1/11 of the share belongs to Zamindars and 10/11 of the share belongs to
East India Company.
• The condition was that if a zamindar was not able to pay some part, he
was deprived of his Zamindari.
• At the same time, the zamindar had to pay his revenue rigidly on the due
date even if the crop had failed for some reason; otherwise his lands were
to be sold.
Benefits of Permanent Settlement
• Stability of income to britishers.
• Enabled the Company to maximize its income as land revenue
was now fixed higher than it had ever been in the past.
• Collection of revenue through a small number of zamindars
seemed to be much simpler and cheaper than the process of
dealing with lakhs of cultivators.
Ryotwari
• It was started in 1792 by Col. Charles Reed
• Thomas Munroe improvised this system in 1820
• Major areas of introduction include Madras, Bombay, parts of Assam
and Coorgh provinces of British India.
• Major fault in this system was the excessive land tax.
• Peasants were the owners of their land
• Peasants were directly responsible to give revenue
• It was implemented in 51% of the British areas
• The revenue rates of Ryotwari System were 50% where the lands were
dry and 60% in irrigated land.
Impact of Ryotwari system
• Even while the position of cultivator became more secure, but the rigid
system of revenue collection forced ryots into the hands of moneylender.
• Since the government itself became a big zamindar, it had right to
enhance revenue at will.
• The cultivator was left at the mercy of the collecting officers.
Mahalwari
• It was started by Holt Mckenzie
• Mahalwari system was introduced in 1833 during the period of William Bentick.
• It was introduced in Central Province, North-West Frontier, Agra, Punjab, Gangetic Valley,
etc of British India.
• Unit of land tax was known as ‘Mahal’. Under this ‘Mahal’, one or more villages could
join
• It was implemented on 30% area.
• The rate of land under this system was very high
• Only cash was accepted under this system and Ownership rights were vested with the
peasants.
• The villages committee was held responsible for collection of the taxes.
Impact of Mahalwari System
• Since the government revised the revenue periodically, the
peasants had not much benefit of elimination of middlemen
between the government and the village.
• This brought about some improvement in irrigation facilities,
though major benefits of the system were largely enjoyed by
the government.
Impact of Land Revenue System:
Land Tenure System
• These land settlements introduced a market economy and removed customary
rights.
• With cash payments of revenue, there was increased money-lending activity.
• The Land tenure system sharpened social differentiation.
• While rich had access to the courts to defend their properties, the poor didn’t
have any resources.
• The peasants were forced to grow commercial crops which led them to buy
food grains at higher prices and sell the cash crops at low prices.
• The land revenue system of British in India shook the stability of Indian villages
where majority of the people depended on agriculture and related activities.
They became miserable if crop failed in any given year.

Laws of Motion
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Newton’s Laws of Motion
• Newton’s First Law
 A body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a
straight line unless an external force acts on it. It is based on law
of inertia.
 Inertia is the property of a body by virtue of which is opposes
any change in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight
line.
Newton’s First Law
• Inertia of Rest
 When a bus or train at rest starts, to move suddenly, the
passengers sitting in it jerk in backward direction due to their
inertia of rest.
 The dust particles come out from a carpet when it is beaten
with a stick due to their inertia of rest.
 A passenger jumping out from a rapidly moving bus or train is
advised to jump in forward direction and run forward for a short
mile due to inertia of rest.
Newton’s First Law
• Inertia of Motion
 When a running bus or train stops suddenly, the passengers
sitting in it jerk in forward direction due to inertia of motion
• Momentum
 The momentum of a moving body is equal to the product of its
mass and its velocity.
Newton’s First Law
• Conservation of Linear Momentum
 The linear momentum of a system of particles remains
conserved if the external force acting on the system is zero.
 Rocket propulsion and engine of jet aeroplane works on
principle of conservation of linear momentum.
 In rocket, ejecting gas exerts a forward force which helps in
accelerating the rocket upward.
Newton’s Second Law
• The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional
to the force applied on it and change in momentum takes place in
the direction of applied force.
Newton’s Third Law
• For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction and both
act on two interacting objects.
• Rocket is propelled by the principle of Newton’s third law of
motion.
Impulse
• A large force which acts on a body for a very short interval of time
and produces a large change in its momentum is called an impulsive
force.
• Its unit is newton-second.
• A fielder lowers its hand when catching a cricket ball because by
lowering his hands, he increases the time of contact for stopping
the ball and therefore fielder has to apply lesser force to stop the
ball. The ball will also exert lesser force on the hands of the fielder
and the fielder will not get hurt.
• Wagons of a train are provided with the buffers to increase the time
of impact during jerks and therefore, decreases the damage.
• The vehicles like scooter, car, bus, truck etc. are provided with
shockers.
Friction
• Friction is a force which opposes the relative motion of the two
bodies when one body actually moves or tries to move over the
surface of another body.
• The cause of friction is the strong atomic or molecular forces of
attraction acting on the two surfaces at the point of actual contact.
Uses of Friction
• A ball bearing is a type of rolling-element that uses balls to
maintain the separation between the bearing races. The purpose of
a ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and to support loads
(weight).
• Friction can be decreases by polishing the surfaces by using
lubricants or by using ball bearings.
• Tyres are made of synthetic rubber because its coefficient or
friction with road is larger and therefore, large force of friction acts
on it, which stops sliding at turns.
Uses of Friction
• The tyres are threading which also increases the friction between
the tyres and the road.
• When pedal is applied to a bicycle, the force of friction on rear
wheel is in forward direction and on front wheel is in the backward
direction.
Loses due to Friction
• Too much Loss of Energy in machines and then ultimately the
machines are damaged.
Machine
• Lever - It is a simple machine in which a straight or inclined rod is
made to turn or rotate at a point freely or independently. There are
three points related to lever namely load, effort and fulcrum.
• Load - The weight carried by the lever is called load.
• Effort - To operate lever, the force applied externally is called effort.
• Fulcrum - The fixed point about which the rod of lever moves
independently is called fulcrum.

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
By Dr Vipan Goyal

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
 Human digestive system
 The Alimentary Canal
 The Esophagus
 Stomach
 Enzymes in Stomach
 Small Intestine
 Large Intestine
HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Definition : The process of reducing food
into smaller molecules that can be
absorbed into the body is called digestion.
Major Organs
 Mouth
 Esophagus
 Stomach
 Small Intestine
 Large Intestine.
Accessory Organs:
 Liver
 Gallbladder
 Pancreas.


THE ALIMENTARY CANAL
The Alimentary Canal
 Ingestion: The process of taking substances into
the body through the mouth.
 Digestion: The breakdown of large, insoluble
food molecules into small water soluble
molecules using mechanical and chemical
processes.
 Absorption: The movement of digestive food
molecules through the wall of the intestine into
the blood or lymph.
 Assimilation: The movement of digestive food
molecules into the cells of the body where they
are used, becoming part of the cells.
 Egestion: The passing out of the food that has
not been digested, as passes , through the anus
THE MOUTH
The Mouth: The first part of the
digestive system. The Entry point of
food.
Structures in the mouth that aids digestion are
• Teeth (cut, tear, crush and grind food)
• Salivary glands–Produce and secrete saliva into the
oral cavity.
Saliva:
It moistens the food, contains enzymes
(ptyalin or salivary amylase). The beginning of
digestion of starch into smaller polysaccharides.
Function:
 Mechanical digestion.
 Increasing surface area for faster chemical
digestion
THE ESOPHAGUS
Esophageal sphincter:
Bolus reaches the stomach must pass
through a muscular ringed valve called the
esophageal sphincter(Cardiac Sphincter).
Function: Prevent stomach acids from back
flowing into the esophagus.
The Esophagus:
A tube connecting the mouth to the stomach,
running through the thoracic cavities. It lies
behind wind pipe (trachea).
The trachea has as an epiglottis, preventing
food from entering the wind pipe, moving the
food to the esophagus while swallowing food
travels down the esophagus, through a series of
involuntary rhythmic contractions (wave-like)
called peristalsis.
Function:
The lining of the esophagus secretes mucus,
lubricating to support the movement of food.
STOMACH
Stomach : J- shaped muscular
sac, has inner folds (rugae),
increasing surface area of the
stomach.
Function:
Stomach performs mechanical
digestion, by churning the bolus
and mixing it with the gastric
juices, secreted by the lining of
the stomach.
Gastric juices:
It contains HCl, salts, enzymes, water and
mucus. HCl helps breakdown of food and kills
bacteria that come along with the food. The
bolus is now called chyme.
ENZYMES IN STOMACH
Enzymes in stomach (acidic environment):
HCl secreation, kill any microbes that are found in the
bolus, creating a pH of 2. Mucus prevents the stomach
from digesting itself.
Pepsin secreation
It is responsible for initiating the breakdown of proteins in
food, hydrolyzes proteins to yield polypeptides (peptones).
Proteins to peptones
At pH 2, the enzyme from the salivary glands stops
breaking down carbohydrates.
Pyloric sphincter:
Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. It
passes through a muscular ringed sphincter called the
pyloricsphincter.
How stomach does not digest itself?
Three protective mechanisms:-
First the stomach only secretes small
amounts of gastric juices until food is
present.
Second the secretion of mucus coats the
lining of the stomach protecting it from
the gastric juices.
The third mechanism is the digestive
enzyme pepsin is secreted in an inactive
protein called pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is
converted to pepsin in the increased
presence of hydrochloric acid (Ph1).
SMALL INTESTINE
Small Intestine
It is responsible for the complete digestion of all macro molecules, and the
absorption of their component molecules. It contains a finger like projection
villi which increases the surface area of small intestine. Food can stay 4 to 8
hours in the small intestine.
Parts of small Intestine
The small intestine is made up of
three parts :
 Duodenum
 Jejunum (no digestion)
 Ileum (no digestion)
DUODENUM
1.Duodenum
The first part is the
duodenum, u-shaped
organ, approximately 30
cm in length. This area
completes most of the
digestion processes.
Enzymes are secreted in to
the duodenum form the
pancreas, gall bladder and
intestinal juice. It is located
between the stomach and
the middle part of the
small intestine, or jejunum.
Pancreas :
It is located behind stomach and produces insulin
and glucagon. These two hormones maintains the
glucose level in the blood through feedback
mechanism. It secretes pancreatic juice containing
proteases, pancreatic amylase and lipase.
Proteases (pepsin, trypsin
and chymotrypsin) Converts
proteins into peptides into
amino acids.
Pancreatic amylase Converts
starch to amylase Lipase
Converts fats into fatty acid
and glycerol.
DUODENUM
Bile juice :
It is produced by liver, stored in the
gall bladder. The bile salts emulsify
fats and break them into smaller
globules which are easily digestible
by lipase.
Liver :
It is a factory for antibodies and
bile, helps in breaking down of fats,
emulsification of fats. It stores
vitamins and sugars until your body
needs them.
Gallbladder :
The storage tank for bile (a greenish- yellow
liquid that helps your body break down and use
fats), located in liver and shaped like a pear
DUODENUM
Intestinal juice :
The epithelial cells of the villi
produce enzymes which complete
the breakdown of:
Maltose to glucose
Peptides to amino acids
Fats to fatty acid and glycerol
2 Jejunum
The jejunum is approximately 2.5 m long.
Although some digestion is completed
here, it has more villi and microvilli; its role
is absorption of nutrients.
3 Ileum
The ileum, is approximately 3m long,has
fewer villi and microvilli than the other
two parts. Although absorption also occurs
here, it is responsible for pushing the
waste materials into the large intestine.
LARGE INTESTINE
Components of large Intestine
The large intestine contains water with
undigested matter, cellulose and fibre
that digested partly by bacteria. It is
composed of several distinctive parts:
Cecum:
Contains beta cellulose enzyme, absent
in human body.
Colon:
The colon consists off our parts:
ascending colon, transverse colon,
descending colon, sigmoid colon. It
contains coliform group of bacterias and
this type of bacterias are useful to check
the water contamination.
Glucose:
It is stored in the form of glycogen in liver and
muscles in animals while in plants, it is stored in
starch.

Nutrition
By Dr Vipan Goyal

NUTRITION
• The process of digestion and absorption of foods and
the body’s use of it for growth and replacement of
cells.
• SIX BASIC NUTRIENTS
• 1. Carbohydrates 2. Proteins 3. Fats 4. Vitamins 5.
Minerals 6. Water
• CARBOHYDRATES: made up of C,H,O in the ratio 1:2:1
• Types of carbohydrates:
• 1. Simple sugars – monosaccharide-single sugar.
a. Glucose – blood sugar sugars are a poor source
b. Fructose – mostly fruits, berries of energy.
c. Galactose – does not occur free in and cause an insulin nature, it is always bonded
to something else
2. Compound sugars – disaccharide – two sugar units
a. Sucrose – sugar cane and sugar beets
b. Maltose – germinating seeds
c. Lactose – milk sugar
• 3. Complex carbohydrate (starch) – polysaccharide – many sugar units
• a. Whole grains
• b. Fruits
• c. Vegetables
• Carbohydrates as energy:
• 1. Glucose is the blood sugar.
• 2. Excess glucose is stored in the body as glycogen.
• a. Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles.
• b. The body can store about ½ day supply of glycogen for energy.

Proteins
• It contains C, H, O, N
• They are made up of amino acids. So amino acids are called building blocks of Protein.
• Functions of Protein
• Proteins play multiple functions in the body and its structure gives it its functionality. Some prominent
functions are:-
• Digestion – Digestion is carried out by the digestive enzymes which are basically proteinaceous in nature.
• Movement – Myosin is a protein found in muscles which enables the contraction of muscles making
movement possible.
• Structure and Support – Keratin is the structural protein which makes our hair, nails, and horns in animals.
• Cellular communication – Cells communicate with other cells and the external environment via receptors
present on the surface of cells. These receptors are made of proteins.
• Act as a messenger – These proteins function as the chemical messengers, which help in the
communication between the cells, tissues, and organs.
Protein
Structure

FATS
• Made up of C,H,O ( oxygen is less than the carbohydrates)
• Fats contain about 9 calories per gram twice as many carbohydrates or
protein.
• Function: (add flavor and help satisfy hunger).
• 1.Body’s storage form for food energy eaten in excess of need.
• 2.Insulates the body.
• 3.Cushions vital body organs.
• 4.Transports fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).
• Types of fats
• 1.Saturated fats – solid or semisolid at room temperature. A fatty acid carrying the maximum
possible number of hydrogen atoms.
• Source – mostly from animal products – meats, poultry, fish, milk, cheese and eggs.
• 1.Vegetable oils high in saturated fats
• a.Palm oil – 50% saturated
• b.Palm kernel oil
• c.Coconut oil – 92% saturated
• Raise cholesterol levels in the blood as well as LDL (bad cholesterol). They add texture and
are more chemically stable to heat.
• 2.Polyunsaturated fats – liquid at room temperature. A fatty acid that has two or more
hydrogen bonds missing. Source – mostly from plants.
• Lowers cholesterol, but also slightly lowers HDL (good cholesterol). They supply essential
fatty acids.
• Monounsaturated fats – liquid at room temperature
• Source – mostly from plants (olive oil & peanut oil)
• Canola oil had both polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.
• Fish Oils – Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that come from fish. They don’t
have much effect on cholesterol.They lower the total amount of fat in the blood
(reduce triglycerides). They help prevent blood clots.
• Trans fatty acids – the process of adding hydrogen to unsaturated fats to make it
more solid and resistant to chemical change.
• Causes it to lose its polyunsaturated character and health benefits.
• Example: Butter – Margarine (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil).
• Two types of cholesterol
• a.Low – Density Lipoproteins – LDL – bad cholesterol
• 1. Fat in the blood stream that is on its way to cell for storage. (including
the cells that line the artery walls)
• 2. Saturated fat causes the body to produce LDL.
• b.High – Density Lipoproteins – HDL – good cholesterol
• 1. Fat in the bloodstream that is in route to the liver where it is processed
and excreted from the body.
• 2. HDL works to minimize the harmful effects of LDL by causing it to be
removed from the bloodstream and excreted.
VITAMINS
Main functions:-
Vitamins are essential to the body:
 To maintain health
 To help prevent deficiency diseases such as
beriberi (weakened muscles, heart, nerves
and digestive system) and rickets (softening
of the bones)
 To regulate the repair of body cells to help
combat the ageing process
 To help to process carbohydrates and release
energy in the body.
Vitamins are of two types:
 Water soluble vitamins- B, C
 Fat soluble vitamins – A, D, E, K
Vitamins are made up of carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen. Vitamins are called micronutrients
because they are needed in only very small
quantities Vitamins are made up of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen. Vitamins are called
micronutrients because they are needed in only
very small quantities.
VITAMINS
Water soluble
 Cannot be stored in body, regular
supply needed.
 Excess is excreted in urine – no
danger of toxic levels
 Unstable to heat and light, leach
into cooking liquids.
Fat soluble
 Can be stored in body – regular
supply not needed
 Can accumulate to toxic levels if
large amounts ingested.
 Fairly stable at normal cooking
temperature.

MINERALS
Minerals : Our body requires mineral elements for a variety of functions. They are also known
as micronutrients. Unlike vitamins, which are organic substances minerals are inorganic and
are found in rocks and soil. Vegetables absorb minerals as they grow, while animals digest it
through their diet. Minerals can be divided into two groups – those needed in larger
quantities (major minerals) and those only required in tiny amounts(trace elements).
1. Trace minerals – are iron, zinc and iodine.
2. Major minerals – are sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorous. Minerals have four
major functions: Body building : Teeth and bones
Control of body processes, especially the nervous system.
Essential part of body fluids and cells.( Potassium in intracellular fluid and Sodium in
extracellular fluid)
Form part of body fluids and cells.
Form part of enzymes and other proteins necessary for the release of energy.
MINERALS
SODIUM
Functions: Maintains water
balance in the body and
controls body temperature,
helps you sweat when body
temperature rises.
Sources: Cheese, bacon,
smoked meats, fish,
processed foods, table salt.
Government advice says an
average you should be
eating no more than 6g of
salt a day.
IRON

Nuts
Deficiency:
Dry skin, acne, Muscle
spasm
GOITRE
 The most common cause of goitre is Iodine
deficiency. It is one of the leading causes of
hypothyroidism.
 Hyperthyroidism (Overactive thyroid gland):
Goitre can develop if the thyroid gland becomes
overactive (hyperthyroidism), leading to too much
thyroid hormones being produced. Increased
hormone production will over-stimulate the thyroid
gland and causes it to enlarge. The leading cause of
hyperthyroidism is Graves’ disease. Graves’ disease
causes immune system (the body’s natural defense
system) to send antibodies (proteins that fight
infections) to the thyroid gland. The antibodies
stimulate the thyroid gland, causing an increased
amount of thyroid hormones to be released.
 Hyporthyroidism (Underactive
thyroid gland): Goitre can also
develop if the thyroid gland becomes
underactive (hypothyroidism).
Underactive thyroid gland does not
produce enough thyroid hormones,
the body will stimulate it to produce
more. This can cause the thyroid
gland to enlarge. Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease
causing hypothyroidism.

Excretory System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Organs that play role in excretion:
Lungs
Skin
Liver
Kidney
The Lungs
• It helps in gaseous exchage.
• Inhale of O2 and exhale of Co2
Excretion through skin
• Sweat, which is excreted through the skin, contains
water, salts and some urea. As the water in the sweat is
excreted, heat is lost and the body is cooled.
• Sweat is a form of excretion as it rids the body of waste,
as well as a form of secretion as it maintains the body
temperature through sebaceous glands or sweat
glands.
• The Excretory systems maintain homeostasis with
respect to water, salt and metabolite concentrations
within the blood.
The liver
• The liver removes metabolic wastes.
• Makes ureas from N2 to NH3 and then Urea
through ornithine cycle.
Excretion through kidney
• When proteins are broken down in humans, a compound called ammonia (NH3) is
formed. Ammonia is highly toxic, so it is converted into urea by the liver, and this
urea is the primary nitrogenous waste found in urine.
• Other waste products excreted in the urine include Uric acid (from breakdown of
DNA and RNA) and Creatinine (from muscle action).
Excretion through kidney
The following substances are made in the liver and excreted by the
kidneys:
• Urea, the main nitrogenous waste compound secreted. It is formed
by the breakdown of excess amino acids in the process of
deamination.
• Uric acid, the nitrogenous end product of nucleic acid metabolism.
Creatinine is formed from creatinine phosphate, found in the muscle
cells.
• Non- nitrogenous waste, Eg: CO2
, Excess water, ions, harmones,
poisons and drugs.
The Urinary System
The main function of the urinary system is
to maintain homeostatis by regulating
the volume and concentration of body
fluids.
It filters and reabsorbs certain materials
from the blood.
The urinary system is made up of the
following parts:
Kidneys: Two organs that filter blood to
remove waste (which is excreted
inurine) and adjusts the concentration
of salts in the blood.
Ureters: Either of a pair of ducts
that carry urine from the
kidneys to the bladder.
Urinary bladder: Stores urine until
it can be excreted.
Urethra: The tube through which
urine exits the bladder.
Nephron
The functional unit of the kidney is the Nephron.
Each kidney contains about 1 million or so
Nephrons.
The Parts of the Nephron
• Glomerulus
• Bowman’s Capsule
• Proximal Tubule
• Loop of Henle
• Distal Tubule
• Collecting Duct
• Glomerulus: The blood vessel inside the
Bowman’s capsule from which water, salts,
nutrient molecules, and waste molecules
leave the blood to be filtered by the kidney.
• Bowman’s capsule: The receiving end of a
renal (kidney) tubule at which water and
small solutes from the blood enter the
proximal tubule from the glomerulus.
• Proximal tubule: The tube between the
Bowman’s capsule and the loop of Henle.
Reabsorption of important nutrients like
water, glucose, and amino acids begins here.
• loop of Henle: The long loop of the nephron
that extends into the medulla of the kidney
between the proximal tubule and the distal
tubule. The main function of the loop of
Henle is to remove water from the filtrate.
• Distal tubule: The tube that connects the
loop of Henle to the collecting duct. The
main job of the distal tubule is to secrete
material like hydrogen ions, creatinine,and
drugs out of the blood into the filtrate.
• Collecting ducts: Carries urine to renal
pelvis.
• WATER and OTHER COMPONENTS IN URINE
• About 96% of urine is water, 1.5% is salts, mainly sodium chloride, urea makes up to
2%. Small quantities of drugs, harmones and preservatives. About 1.5 litres of urine is
produced daily.
• The amount of water found in urine depends on the permeability of the distal tubule
and the collecting duct. This permeability is controlled by a hormone (chemical
messenger) called anti- diuretic hormone (ADH). ADH increases permeability, which
allows the body to reabsorb water so it doesn’t go out in urine.
• If you drink a lot of fluid, ADH is not produced so the kidneys do not reabsorb the
water. As well, certain drugs like alcohol and caffeine blockthe release of ADH and
increase urine volume.
• Chemicals in urine precipitate and form crystals, mostly calcium oxalate.
ANIMALS AND EXCRETORY PARTS
• Unicellular Animals / Ameoba – by diffusion through surface of the body.
• Platyhelminthes/ Flatworms – by Flame cells
• Round worms/Earthworms – by Nephridia
• Arthropods/ Cockroaches – by Malphigian tubules
• Crustaceans / Prawns - Antennal glands / Green Glands
• Vertebrates –kidney
• Kidney stone
• More common in men than women.
• Factors that cause stones include urinary tract infections,
insufficient water intake, low. activity level, and/or too much
vitamin C or D.
• Symptoms include severe pain, blood in the urine, nausea.
Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)
• Kidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted blood
flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of poisonous
wastes in the body, which can even lead to death.
• In case of kidney failure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to
remove nitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.
• Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended in a
tank filled with dialysing fluid. This fluid has the same osmotic pressure as blood, except that
it is devoid of nitrogenous wastes. The patient’s blood is passed through these tubes.
• During this passage, the waste products from the blood pass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.
The purified blood is pumped back into the patient. This is similar to the function of the
kidney, but it is different since there is no reabsorption involved.
• Normally, in a healthy adult, the initial filtrate in the kidneys is about 180 L daily. However,
the volume actually excreted is only a litre or two a day, because the remaining filtrate is
reabsorbed in the kidney tubules.
Thank You
LIGHT
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Light
• Light is a form of energy, which is propagated as electromagnetic wave. (The waves of
energy are called electromagnetic (EM) because they have oscillating electric and
magnetic fields.)
• Light has a dual nature. It behaves as wave and particle both.
• Acc. to wave theory: light consist of electromagnetic waves, which do not require
material medium to travel.
• Acc. to particle theory: light is composed of particles which travels in a straight line at a
very high speed.
• For e.g: The phenomenon of diffraction, interference and polarization of light can only be
explained if light is considered to be of wave nature. The particle theory of light cannot
explain this phenomenon.
• The phenomenon of reflection and refraction of light, and casting of shadows of objects
by the light can be explained only if it is thought to be made up of particles. Wave theory
of light cannot explain this phenomenon.
Light
• Speed of light was first measured by Roemer.
• It is the radiation which make our eyes able to 'see the object.
Its speed is 3 x 108 m/s. It is the form of energy. It is a
transverse wave.
• It takes 8 min 19s to reach on the earth from the sun and the
light reflected from moon takes 1.28s to reach earth.
• Primary Colours- Blue, Red, Green
• Secondary Colours- The coloured produced my mixing any
two primary colors. E.g. Yellow, Magenta and Cyan(Peacock
Blue)
• Complementary Colours- Any two colours when added
produce white light. Red+ Cyan= White, Blue+Yellow=White
• PRISM: VIBGYOR
• Phenomenon of 7 colors through prism is called
Dispersion of Light.
• Wavelength of violet colour is minimum and red
colour is maximum.
• Deviation of light in prism depends on
wavelength and its refractive index.
• Violet colour shows maximum deviation on
passing white light through prism.
• Red Colour has longest wavelength and low
frequency and low refractive index.
Human Eye
• Eye forms the real image of the objects on the retina.
• Ciliary muscles change the focal length of eye lens. This power of eye is called
Accommodation of eye.
• Least distance of distinct vision is 25 cm.
• Myopia or short sightedness- far objects cannot see clear. Concave lens are used.
• Hyperopia or hypermetropia or Long-sightedness- Near objects cannot see clear.
Convex lens are used.
• Presbyopia- in elder person, both far and near cannot see clear. To correct this
defect, a person is prescribed bifocal lens.
• Astigmatism- Person cannot focus on horizontal and vertical lines at the same
distance at the same time. Cylinderical lens are used.
• Cataract- White membrane is developed on cornea due to which a person loses
power of vision partially or completely. Cured by Surgery.
Light
• Light is a form of energy which helps us to see objects.
• When light falls on objects, it reflects the light and when the reflected
light reaches our eyes then we see the objects.
• Light travels in straight line.
• The common phenomenon of light are formation of shadows formation of
images by mirrors and lenses, bending of light by a medium, twinkling of
stars, formation of rainbow etc.
• Speed of light in vacuum is 3x108 m/s but different in different media.
• Value of speed of light is high in air > water > Glass
• Luminous Objects : Those objects which emit its own light called luminous
objects. E.g. Sun, Stars etc.
• Non-Luminous Objects : Those objects which do not emit its own light but
become visible due to reflection of light falling on them are called non
luminous objects. E.g. Moon, Table.
Reflection of Light
• When light falls on a highly polished surface like a mirror, most of the light
is sent back into the same medium. This process is called reflection of
light.
• (i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and
• (ii) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence and
the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.
• These laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces
including spherical surfaces.
Reflection of Light
Properties of image formed by a plain mirror
• Image formed by a plain mirror is always virtual and erect.
• The size of the image is equal to that of the object.
• The image formed is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it.
• The image is laterally inverted.
• If an object moves towards a plain mirror with speed v, relative to the
object the moves towards it with a speed 2v.
• To see his full image in a plane mirror, a person required a mirror of at
least half of his height.
Properties of image formed by a plain mirror
• When two plane mirrors are kept
facing each other at an angle theta
and an object is placed between
then :
SPHERICAL MIRRORS
• A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is,
faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror. A
spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a
convex mirror.
Concave mirror
• It is a spherical mirror whose reflecting
surface is curved inwards. Rays of light are
parallel to the principal axis after reflection
from a concave mirror, meet at a point
(converge) on the principal axis.
• Also called converging mirror.
• Image formed by a concave mirror is
generally real and inverted.
Convex mirror
• A spherical mirror whose reflecting
surface is curved outwards. Rays of light
parallel to the principal axis after
reflection from a convex mirror get
diverged and appear to come from a
point behind the mirror.
• Also called diverging mirror.
• Image formed by a convex mirror is
always virtual, erect and diminished.
• Mirror’s Formula
• 1/u + 1/v = 1/f
• Where f= focal length of mirror, u= distance of object from mirror, v=
distance of image from mirror
• Magnification (m) = Image distance (v)/ Object distance (u)
Uses of Concave Mirrors
• Concave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and vehicles
headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light.
• They are often used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face.
The dentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of
patients. Large concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to
produce heat in solar furnaces.
 (i) As a shaving mirror
 (ii) As a reflector for the head lights of a vehicle, search light
 (iii) In ophthalmoscope to examine eye, ear, nose by doctors.
 (iv) In solar cookers.
Uses of Convex Mirrors
• Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in vehicles.
• These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the driver to
see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex mirrors are
preferred because they always give an erect, though diminished, image.
• Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved outwards. Thus,
convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger area than would be
possible with a plane mirror.
 (i) As a rear-view mirror in vehicle because it provides the maximum
rear field of view and image formed is always erect.
 (ii) In sodium reflector lamp.
• The height of the object is taken to be positive as the object is
usually placed above the principal axis.
• The height of the image should be taken as positive for virtual
images.
• It is to be taken as negative for real images, a negative sign in the
value of the magnification indicates that the image is real.
• A positive sign in the value of the magnification indicates that the
image is virtual.
Terminology in study of spherical mirrors
• Center of curvature: It is the centre of the
sphere of which the mirror is a part(C).
• Radius of curvature(R): It is the radius of the
sphere of which the mirror is a part.
• Pole: Is the centre of the spherical mirror.
• Principal axis: It is the straight line passing
through the centre of curvature and the pole.
• Focal length: It is the distance between the
pole and principal focus(f). in a spherical
mirror, the radius of curvature is twice the
focal length.
• R=2f or f=R/2
Image Formation by a Concave and Convex
Mirror for Different Positions Of the Object
REFRACTION OF LIGHT
• When light travels obliquely from one
transparent medium into another it
gets bent. This bending of light is called
refraction of light.
• When light travels from a rarer medium
to a denser medium, it bends towards
the normal.
• When light travels from a denser
medium to a rarer medium, it bends
away from the normal.
• The cause of refraction is that the speed
of light is different in different media.
REFRACTION OF LIGHT
• In Refraction, speed of light and its wavelength change but its frequency
remains unchanged, when light travels from one transparent medium to
another.
• Examples :
 when a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters
appear raised when viewed through the glass slab the bottom of a
tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised seen a pencil
partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler. It appears to be displaced
at the interface of air and water
 A lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its
actual size, when viewed from the sides.
Laws of Refraction
• 1. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of
incidence all three lie in the same plane.
• 2. The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction
remains constant for a pair of media i.e. sin i/sin r = constant
• This is called snell’s law and also called refractive index of second medium
with respect of first medium.
• Refractive index = The ratio of speed of light in vacuum ( c ) to the speed
of light in any medium (v)
• A coin appears at lesser depth in water.
ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION
• The air just above the fire becomes hotter than the air further up. The
hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler air above it, and has a
refractive index slightly less than that of the cooler air.
• Since the physical conditions of the refracting medium (air) are not
stationary, the apparent position of the object, as seen through the hot
air, fluctuate.
• This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction of
light by the earth’s atmosphere).
REFRACTIVE INDEX
• The absolute refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed
light in air or vacuum to the speed of light in medium.
• Refractive index = speed of light in air or vacuum/speed of light in
the medium
Twinkling of stars
• The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight.
• The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction
continuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction
occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index.
• Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent
position of the star is slightly different from its actual position.
• As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly,
the starlight entering the eye flickers – the star sometimes appears
brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.
Advance sunrise and delayed sunset
• The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise, and
about 2 minutes after the actual sunset because of atmospheric
refraction.
• The time difference between actual sunset and the apparent sunset is
about 2 minutes.
Examples of Refraction
• Bending of a linear object when it is partially dipped in a liquid inclined to
the surface of the liquid.
• Oval shape of the sun in the morning and evening.
• A fish in a pond when viewed from air appears to be at a smaller depth
them actual depth.
• A coin at the base of a vessel filled with water appears raised.
Dispersion of white light by a glass prism
• The prism has probably split the incident white light into a band of
colours. The sequence of colours VIBGYOR.
• The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion.
• Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the
incident ray, as they pass through a prism.
• The red light bends the least while the violet the most.
• Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus
become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a
spectrum.
• The dispersion of light is due to different velocities of light of different
colours in a medium. As a result, the refractive index of a medium is
different for different colours of light.
• The velocity of light in a medium is maximum for that colour for which
refractive index is minimum. Clearly, the velocity of violet colour or light is
minimum in a medium and refractive index of that medium in a maximum
for violet colour.
• Similarly, the velocity of light in a medium is maximum for red colour and
refractive index of that medium in a minimum for red colour.
Rainbow
• A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower. It
is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the
atmosphere.
• A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun.
• The water droplets act like small prisms. They refract and disperse the
incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when
it comes out of the raindrop.
• Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours
reach the observer’s eye.
Theory of Colours
• Colour is the sensation perceived by the rods in the eye due to light.
• Primary Colours : The spectral colours blue, red and green are called
primary colours because all the colours can be produced by mixing these
in proper proportion.
 Blue + Red + Green = White
• Secondary Colours : The colour produced by mixing any two primary
colours is called secondary colour. There are 3 secondary colours yellow,
magenta and cyan as
• Green + Red = Yellow Red + Blue = Magenta Blue + Green = Cyan
Complementary Colours
• The complementary primary–secondary
combinations are red–cyan, green–magenta,
and blue–yellow. In the RGB color model,
the light of two complementary colors, such
as red and cyan, combined at full intensity,
will make white light, since
two complementary colors contain light
with the full range of the spectrum.
• In coloured television, the three primary
colours are used.
• Red + Cyan = White ; Blue + Yellow = White
etc.
Coloured Television
• Light coming from the scene to be televised is split up in red, blue and
green primary colour components with the help of dichromatic mirrors
fitted in TV camera.
• Now, light of different colours are incident on three separate camera tubes
which converts them into electrical signals.
• These signals are transmitted to distant places. At the receiving end, these
signals are received and the picture tube of a TV set produces the same
scene on the screen.
Mixed coloured Pigments
• The pigments in common use are of impure colours. Therefore, on mixing
paints of different colours the resultant colour of the paint is not obtained
as given by colour triangle.
• When blue and yellow mixed together, they produce green inspite of
white paint.
Colour of Bodies
• The colour of a body is the colour of light which it reflects or transmits. An
object is white, if it reflects all the components of white light and it is
black if it absorbs all the light incident over it.
• This is why red rose appears red when viewed in a white or red light but
appears black when viewed in blue or green light.
SCATTERING OF LIGHT
• When light passes through a medium in which
particles are suspended whose sizes are of the
order of wavelength of light, then light on striking
these particles, deviated in different directions.
This is called scattering of light.
• According to lord Rayleigh, the intensity of
scattered light is fourth power of wavelength.
Therefore, red colour of light is scattered least and
violet colour of light is scattered most.
• The blue colour of the sky, colour of water in deep
sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the
sunset.
Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?
• The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light.
Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in
air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red.
The scattered blue light enters our eyes.
• If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any
scattering.
• Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers
flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights.
• Danger signals are of red colours because red colours light scatters least
and therefore these signals can be seen from far away.
• Sun appears reddish at the time of sunrise or sunset, because the sun is
near horizon and sunlight travels maximum distance in earth’s
atmosphere.
• Clouds appear white because clouds are consists of large size of droplets
of water and dust particles which scatter all colours of light equally. The
mixture of all seven colours of sunlight is white.
• Sky appears black to astronauts from space because there is no
atmosphere in space and therefore, no scattering of light take place.
Critical angle
• Critical angle : The angle of incidence in a denser
medium for which the angle of refraction in rarer
medium becomes 90 degree, is called Critical
Angle (C).
• Refractive index of denser medium =
 1/sin Critical Angle
Total Internal Reflection
• When a light ray travelling from a denser medium towards a rarer medium
is incident at an angle of incidence greater than critical angle, then light
rays reflected back into denser medium. This phenomenon is called TIR.
• For total internal reflection,
• A) Light must be propagating from denser to rarer medium.
• B) Angle of incidence must exceeds the critical angle.
• Examples :
• a) mirage – Desert e.g. Hotter air is less dense, and has smaller refractive
index than the cooler air. On hot summer days, the air near the ground
becomes hotter than the air at higher levels noticed that while moving in a
bus or a car during a hot summer day, a distant patch of road, especially
on a highway, appears to be wet. This is also due to mirage.
• b) Diamonds - Their brilliance is mainly due to the total internal reflection
of light inside them.
• c) Optical fibers too make use of the phenomenon of total internal
reflection. Light undergoes repeated total internal reflections along the
length of the fiber there is no appreciable loss in the intensity of the light
signal.
• Optical Fibers are used in Endoscopy, in decorative table lamps, in
telecommunications and networking.
• Sparkling of diamond, mirage and looming, shinning of air bubble in water
and optical Fiber are examples of total internal reflection.
• Shining of a smoked ball or a metal ball on which lamp soot is deposited
when dipped in a water.
Interference of light
• Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new
wave pattern.
• It refers to the interference of waves which are correlated or coherent
with each other, either because they come from the same source or
because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.
• Two non-monochromatic waves are only fully coherent with each other if
they both have exactly the same range of wavelengths and the same
phase differences at each of the constituent wavelengths.
• The modification in the intensity of light in the region of superposition is
called interference of light.
• Constructive Interference: If the crest of one
wave falls on the crest of another wave, then
the amplitude and resultant intensity is
maximum. This is constructive interference.
Here both the waves have the same
displacement and the waves are in phase.
• Destructive interference: If the crest of one
wave falls on the trough of another wave,
then the amplitude and resultant intensity is
minimum. This is destructive interference.
Here the waves do not have the same
displacement and the waves are out of phase.
Diffraction
• It is the bending of light around the corner of an
obstacle. Reflected light produces fridges of light,
dark or colored bands.
• The spreading of light energy beyond the limit
prescribed by rectilinear propagation of light is
called diffraction of light.
• At times diffraction of sunlight in clouds
produces a multitude of colors.
• Example of diffraction in nature is diamond rays
in the solar eclipse.
Examples
• A soap bubble of oil film on water appears coloured in a white light due to
interference of light reflected from upper and lower surfaces of soap
bubble or oil film.
• In interference patterns of all bright and dark fringes are of same width
but in the diffraction the central fringe is brightest an widest, and
remaining are of gradually decreasing intensities.
• The difference between interference and diffraction is that the
interference is superposition of light coming from two different sources
and in the diffraction it is the superposition between the waves coming
from single wavefront.
Polarisation
• It is the only phenomenon which proves that light is a transverse wave.
• Natural sunlight and most forms of artificial illumination transmit light
waves whose electric field vectors vibrate in all perpendicular planes with
respect to the direction of propagation.
• The visible effect of light is only due to electric field vector.
• Polarisation can take place only in the transverse waves.
• Polarised are used for the polarisation of light.
• Application of Polaroid :
• Used in sun glasses and protect the eye from the glare.
• The wind shield of automobile is made up of polaroid. They protect the
eyes of the driver of automobile from dazzling light of vehicle.
• Used in window panes of train and especially of a aeroplane.
• The picture taken by stereoscopic camera, when seen with the help of
polaroid spectacles, create three dimensional effect.
Tyndall Effect
• Tyndall effect is the scattering of light as a light beam passes through a
colloid. The individual suspension particles scatter and reflect light,
making the beam visible. The amount of scattering depends on the
frequency of the light and density of the particles.
• The earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles
like smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust and molecules
of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine particles, the path of the
beam becomes visible.
• When a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small
hole. Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through a
canopy of a dense forest.
• The color of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering
particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of
larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.
Image Formation by Lenses
• Lens is a transparent medium which is formed by joining two pieces of
spherical glass. There are two types of lenses.
 (i) Convex Lens or Convergent Lens : It is a lens which is thicker at the
centre and thinner at the edges.
 (ii) Concave Lens or Divergent Lens : It is a lens which is thinner at the
centre and thicker at the edges.
Terms Related to a Lens
• Optical Centre of Lens : It is the
centre of the lens through which
light can pass without any deviation
• Principal Axis : It is the line passing
through optical centre and is
perpendicular to the line joining its
edges.
• Principal Focus : It is a point on the
principal axis where all light rays
which are parallel to principal axis
either converge or appear to
diverge from, after refraction.

 Used in spy holes on
doors to check the
visitors.
 Used to correct the
vision of short-sighted
persons

Real images
• Real Image is an image which can be
projected onto a screen.
• Real images are always located in front
of the mirror and behind the lens.
• Real images are always inverted and
never upright.
• Concave lenses, Convex mirrors and
plane mirrors always form virtual
images and can never form real
images.
Virtual images
• Virtual Image is an image which cannot be projected onto a screen.
• Virtual images are always located in behind the mirror and in front
of the lens.
• Virtual images are always upright and never inverted.
Lens formula for spherical lenses
• The lens formula for spherical lenses is the relationship between
the object distance(u), image distance(v) and focal length (f).
Magnification by lens
• Magnification for spherical lens is the ratio of the height of the
image to the height of the object.
• Magnification = Height of the image/ Height of the object
• The magnification is also related to the object distance and image
distance. It can be expressed as:
Power of Lens
• The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length (in metres).
• The SI unit of power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre is one
dioptre. The power of a convex lens is positive (+ve) and the power
of a concave lens is negative (-ve).
Camera ( f-number)
• The f-number represents the size of aperture,
• f-number = Focal length of the lens/ Diameter of the lens (D)
• Generally 2,2.8,4,5.6 ,8,11,22,32 are f-numbers.
• The amount of Light (L) entering the camera is directly proportional to the
area (A) of the aperture
• i.e. L ∝ A ∝ D2
• Brightness of image ∝ D2/F2
• Exposure time is the time for which light is incident on the photographic
film.
Simple Microscope
• This is simply a convex lens of small focal
length. The object to be enlarged is
placed within the focus of lens.
• Magnifying power = M= 1 + D/f
• Where D= 25cm, f = focal length of lens
• When final image is formed at infinity,
then M = D/f
• Objective lens is a convex lens of large
aperture and large focal length while eye
piece is a convex lens of small aperture
and small focal length.
Compound Microscope
• It consists of two convex lenses coaxially
fitted in a hollow tube. The lens facing the
object is called objective and the lens
towards the eye is called eye piece.
• The aperture of objective is smaller than
that of eye piece.
• Both the lenses are of smaller focal
lengths. This increases the magnifying
power of instrument.
Telescope
• They are used to view distant objects which
are not visible to naked eye.
• Astronomical Telescope consists of two convex
lenses placed coaxially in a hollow tube. The
lens facing the object is called objective lens
and lens towards the eye is called eye piece.
• The objective has large aperture so that the
rays from the object can be easily collected.
• The focal length of objective is larger than that
of eye piece.

Magnetism
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Magnetism
• The earth behaves as a magnet
with the magnetic field pointing
approximately from the
geographic south to the north.
• When a bar magnet is freely
suspended, it points in the northsouth direction. The tip which
points to the geographic north is
called the North Pole and the tip
which points to the geographic
south is called the south pole of
the magnet.
Magnetism
• There is a repulsive force when north
poles (or south poles) of two magnets
are brought close together.
• Conversely, there is an attractive force
between the north pole of one magnet
and the south pole of the other.
• We cannot isolate the north or South
Pole of a magnet.
• If a bar magnet is broken into two
halves, we get two similar bar
magnets with somewhat weaker
properties.
• Unlike electric charges, isolated
magnetic north and south poles
known as magnetic monopoles do
not exist.
• It is possible to make magnets out
of iron and its alloys.
Earth’s Magnetism
• The strength of the earth's magnetic
field varies from place to place on the
earth's surface; its value being of the
order of 10−5 T.
• The magnetic field is now thought to
arise due to electrical currents produced
by convective motion of metallic fluids
(consisting mostly of molten iron and
nickel) in the outer core of the earth.
This is known as the dynamo effect.
• The magnetic field lines of the earth
resemble that of a (hypothetical)
magnetic dipole located at the centre
of the earth.
• The axis of the dipole does not
coincide with the axis of rotation of
the earth but is presently titled by
approximately 11.3 degree with
respect to the later.
• If one looks at the magnetic field lines
of the earth, one sees that unlike in
the case of a bar magnet, the field
lines go into the earth at the north
magnetic pole (Nm) and come out
from the south magnetic pole (Sm).
• The convention arose because the
magnetic north was the direction to which
the north pole of a magnetic needle
pointed; the north pole of a magnet was
so named as it was the north seeking pole.
• Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole
behaves like the south pole of a bar
magnet inside the earth and vice versa.
• The earth's core is very hot and molten,
and the ions of iron and nickel are
responsible for earth's magnetism. This
hypothesis seems very probable.
FACTS
• Moon, which has no molten core, has no magnetic field,
• Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a weaker magnetic field,
while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has
a fairly strong magnetic field.
• However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and the
energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood.
Earth’s Magnetism
• Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and
beyond, in a stream called the solar wind.
• Their motion is affected by the earth's magnetic field, and in turn,
they affect the pattern of the earth's magnetic field.
• The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is quite different from
that in other regions of the earth.
Magnet
• A magnet is a material which can attract iron objects.
• A natural magnet is an ore of iron (𝐹𝑒3𝑂4) called magnetite or lodestone.
• A magnet which is prepared artificially is called an artificial magnet.
• A freely suspended magnet always aligns itself into North-South direction.
Like magnetic poles repel and unlike magnetic poles attract each other.
• A current-carrying coil containing a soft iron core is called an
electromagnet.
• An electromagnet is utilised in electric bell, telegraph, receiver, telephone
diaphragm, transformer, dynamo etc.
• Permanent magnets are made of steel and temporary magnet or
electromagnets are made of soft iron because steel cannot magnetised
easily but when it is magnetised one time, cannot be demagnetised easily.
The soft iron can be magnetised or demagnetised easily.
Properties of Magnet
• Attractive property A magnet can attract
small pieces of magnetic substances like
iron, steel, cobalt, nickel etc. The attraction
is maximum at poles.
• Unlike poles attract and like poles repel.
• Directive property A magnet, when
suspended freely, aligns itself
approximately along geographical N-S line.
• Magnetic poles exist in pairs If a magnet is
cut into two equal parts transverse to its
length, then N and S-poles of the magnet
do not get separated.
Magnetic Field
• The space in the surrounding of a magnet or
a current carrying conductor, in which its
magnetic effect can be experienced, is called
magnetic field.
• Magnetic lines of force is an imaginary line
drawn in magnetic field at which a magnetic
North pole will move, if it is free to do so.
• A tangent drawn at any point of a magnetic
line of force represents the direction of
magnetic field at that point.
• The magnetic flux linked with a
surface is equal to the total
number of magnetic lines of force
passing through that surface
normally.
• Its unit is weber.
Earth’s Magnetism
• The earth has its own magnetic field. The pole near the geographic North
of the earth is called the magnetic North pole.
• Similarly, the pole near the geographic South pole is called the magnetic
South pole.
• Magnetic compass A magnetic needle which always direct in North-South
(N-S) direction.
• The Earth's magnetic field diverts charged particle coming from space
towards its poles and saves living beings from being severely harmed.
Magnetic storm
• Local disturbances in the earth’s magnetic
field which can damage
telecommunication which are probably
caused by lump of charged particles
emanating from the sun are known as
magnetic storm.
• Example: In the Arctic Circle, they are
known as aurora borealis or the northern
lights, while in the Antarctic Circle they
are called aurora australis or the southern
lights.
• Moving Coil Galvanometer
• A moving coil galvanometer is used to detect the
presence of current and the direction of current
in any circuit. It can measure current up to 10-6
ampere.
• Shunt : It is a wire of very small resistance.
Ammeter
• An ammeter is an instrument used to measure
electric current. It is always connected in series.
• The resistance of an ideal ammeter is zero.
• A galvanometer can be converted into an
ammeter by connecting a low resistance/shunt in
parallel.
Voltmeter
• A voltmeter is a device used to measure
potential difference between two points in
an electric circuit.
• The resistance of an ideal voltmeter is
infinity. It is always connected in parallel.
• A galvanometer can be converted into a
voltmeter by connecting a high resistance
in series.
• A small resistance connected in parallel
with the load resistance to reduce amount
of electric current through resistor is called
shunt.
Magnetic Substances
There are three types of magnetic substances
• Paramagnetic
• Diamagnetic
• Ferromagnetic.
Paramagnetic Substances
• Those substances which are feebly magnetised in the direction of
magnetic field when placed in strong magnetic field are called
paramagnetic substances.
• For examples—Aluminium, platinum, chromium, manganese, solutions of
salts of iron, nickel, oxygen etc.
• These substances are attracted towards strong magnetic field in a nonuniform magnetic field.
• The magnetism of these substances decreases with increase in
temperature.
Diamagnetic Substances
• Those substances which are feebly magnetised in the opposite direction of
magnetic field when placed in strong magnetic field are called
diamagnetic substances.
• For examples— Gold, silver, zinc, copper, mercury, water, alcohol, air,
hydrogen etc.
• These substances are attracted towards weak magnetic field in a nonuniform magnetic field.
• The magnetism produced in these substances does not change with
increase or decrease in temperature.
Ferromagnetic Substances
• Those substances which are strongly magnetised in the direction of
magnetic field when placed in it, are called ferromagnetic substances.
• For examples —Iron, nickel, cobalt etc.
Curie Temperature
• The magnetism produced in these substances decreases with increase in
temperature and at a particular temperature, called Curie temperature.
• At the Curie temperature, a paramagnetic substance becomes
diamagnetic.
• Curie temperature for iron is 770°C and for nickel is 358°C.
• Permanent magnets are made up of steel, cobalt, steel, ticonal, alcomax
and alnico.
Facts
• Isogonic lines are lines on the
Earth's surface along which the
declination has the same
constant value, and
• lines along which the declination
is zero are called agonic lines.
• Isoclinic lines are imaginary lines on
the earth's surface connecting points
where the earth's magnetic field has
the same angle.
• The aclinic line is the magnetic
equator, where the magnetic field is
inclined neither north or south, so it's
a special case of an isoclinic line.
• Isodynamic line- A line on a map
connecting points of equal strength of
the earth's magnetic field.
Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)
• Whenever the magnetic flux linked with
an electric circuit changes, an emf is
induced in the circuit. This phenomenon
is called electromagnetic induction.
Faraday’s Laws of EMI
• Whenever the magnetic flux linked with
a circuit changes, an induced emf is
produced in it.
• The induced emf loses as long as the
change in magnetic flux continues.
Lenz’s Law
• The direction of induced emf
or induced current is always
in such a way that it opposes
the cause due to which it is
produced.
Eddy Current
• If a piece of metal is placed in a varying
magnetic field or rotated with high speed
in a uniform magnetic field, then induced
current set up in the piece is like whirlpool
of air, called eddy current, also known as
foucault’s current.
Uses
• Eddy currents are used in dead beat
galvanometer, induction furnaces,
induction motor, speedometers of
automobiles etc.
• Eddy currents are used in diathermy for
deep heat treatment of the human body.
Self and Mutual Induction
• The phenomenon of production of
induced emf in a circuit due to change in
current flowing in its own, is called self
induction.
• The unit of self induction is Henry (H).
• The phenomenon of production of
induced emf in a circuit due to change in
magnetic flux in its neighbouring circuit, is
called mutual induction.
• Its unit is Henry (H).
Alternating Current
• An electric current whose magnitude and direction
changes continuously is called alternating current.
• The frequency of alternating current in India is 50 Hz
i.e. a 50Hz electrical system means that it completes
50 cycles per second
• Mean or average value of AC is zero for one
complete cycle. Since the positive and negative
half cycles are equal, therefore the charge
transferred due to these two halves will be equal but
in opposite direction.
• Therefore, net charge transferred across any point of
circuit in one time period of sinusoidal AC current
is zero. Hence, its average value is zero.
 Root mean square value of AC is given by
𝐼𝑟𝑚𝑠 = 𝐼0/√2
 An AC ammeter and AC voltmeter read root mean square value of
alternating current and alternating voltage respectively.
• AC Generator or Dynamo
 It is a device which Inverts mechanical energy into alternating current.
 Its working is based on electromagnetic induction.
• DC Motor
 It is a device which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
 Its working is based on the fact that when a current carrying coil is
placed in uniform magnetic field, a torque acts on it.
Microphone
 It converts sound into electrical energy and works on the principle of
EMI.
Transformer
• It is a device which can change a low voltage current into a high voltage
current and vice-versa. Its working is based on mutual induction and can
be used in case of alternating current.
• Step-up Transformer
 It converts a low voltage current into a high voltage current.
 The main energy losses in a transformer are given below
 Iron loss —Flux loss
• Step–down Transformer
 It converts a high voltage current into a low voltage current.
• The current generated in the power stations are alternating current
having voltage 22000 volt or more.
• In grid substations, with the help of transformer, their voltage is
increased up to 132000 volt to minimise loss of energy in long
distance transmission.
Electricity
• Flow of Electrons is called Electricity
• The electricity produced by friction between
two appropriate bodies, is called static
electricity, it is also called frictional electricity.
• Coulomb’s law:-
 The electrostatic force of interaction acting
between two stationary point charges is
directly proportional to the product of
magnitude of charges and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
F=(Kq1-q2)/r2
Electric Field
• The space in the surrounding of any
charge in which its influence can be
experience by other charge, is called
electric field.
• Electric field intensity (E) at any point is
defined as the electrostatic force (F) acting
per unit positive test charge (q) at the
point.
• 𝑬 = 𝑭/ 𝑞
• Its unit is newton/coulomb.
• Therefore, electric field intensity is
inversely proportional to the square of the
distance r from the point charge.
Electric Field
• Electric Field Lines
 An electric field line is an
imaginary line, so that its tangent
at any point is in the direction of
the electric field vector at that
point.
 Two lines can never intersect.
Electric field lines always begin
on a positive charge and end on a
negative charge and do not start
or stop in mid space.
Electric Potential
• Electric potential at a point in an
electric field is equal to the work done
per unit charge in carrying a test charge
from infinity to that point. Its unit is
joule/coulomb.
• Electric potential, V = 𝑊/𝑞
• Potential difference is that physical
quantity which decides the direction of
flow of charge between two points in
electric field.
• Positive charge always tends to move
from higher potential towards lower
potential.
Electric Dipole and Capacitor
• An electric dipole consists of two
equal and opposite point charges
separated by a very small distance.
• Electric dipole moment of the dipole
is product of charge and the
separation between the charges.
• A capacitor or condenser is a device
over which a large amount of charge
can be stored without changing its
dimensions.
• The capacitance of a conductor is equal to the ratio of the charge
(q) given to the conductor to change in its potential (V) is given by C
=𝑞/𝑉
• Its unit is coulomb/volt or farad. Farad (F) is a large unit of
capacitance. Its practical unit is microfarad (𝜇𝐹).
1𝜇𝐹 = 10−6𝐹
Important Facts
• A comb run through one's dry hair attracts small bits of paper. Why?
What happens if the hair is wet or if it is a rainy day?
• (Remember, a paper does not conduct electricity). This is because the
comb gets charged by friction.
• The molecules in the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting
in a net force of attraction.
• If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction between hair and the comb
reduces. The comb does not get charged and thus it will not attract small
bits of paper.
Important Facts
• Ordinary rubber is an insulator. But special rubber tyres of aircraft are
made slightly conducting. Why is this necessary?
• To enable them to conduct charge (produced by friction) to the ground; as
too much of static electricity accumulated may result in spark and result in
fire.
Important Facts
• A bird perches on a bare high power line, and nothing happens to the bird.
A man standing on the ground touches the same line and gets a fatal
shock. Why?
• When a bird is perched on a bare high power line , the circuit does
not get completed between the earth and the bird , therefore nothing
happens to the bird .
• When a man standing on ground touches the same line, the circuit
between the man and the earth gets completed. As a result, he gets a fatal
shock.
• Current passes only when there is difference in potential.
• Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow. Currents
do not obey the law of vector addition. That current is a scalar also follows
from it's definition.
• Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a
negative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form closed
loops.

Mahajanpadas
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Mahajanapadas & Rise of Magadha
• In the 8th century BC, India could be broadly
understood in terms of five large regions viz.
• Madhyadesa (the middle country),
• Pratichya (western lands),
• Prachya (Eastern region),
• Uttarpatha (the land in the north of Vindhyas)
• and Dakshinpatha (the land south of Vindhyas).
• Panini in the 4
th century BC mentions as many as 22
different Janpadas, but also mentions 3 most
important viz. Magadha, Kosala and Vatsa.
Mahajanapadas
• Budhhist literature Angutara Nikaya,
Mahavastu and Jain literature
(Bhagvati Sutta) gives a list of 16 great
kingdoms or Mahajanapadas in the
begining of 6
thcentury B.C
• Major reason of the formation of
Janapadas was use of Iron tools for
agricultural & military purposes
Evolution of Mahajanapadas
• The society in Vedic period was rural, where
smallest political unit was a Vis.
• However, some later Vedic texts detail about the
Janpadas such as Kuru, Panchala, Matysa, Kunti,
Kikata, Jayminia, Kashi, Magadha, Anga,
Kamboja etc.
• The rise of Janpadas is mainly attributed to the
establishment of settled agriculture
communities.
• The development of an agriculture based
economy led to increase in crops and cattle
wealth coupled with use of iron in technology.
Evolution of Mahajanapadas
• The society was now totally divided into 4
Varna Based upon occupation, new labour
class and landed classes emerged. The
landed class was known as Gahapatis.
• The trade flourished and the towns, which
were either located on trade routes such
as Mathura or located, near the banks of
rivers such as Magadha developed.
• This transition also saw an emergence of
taxing, standing army, territorial powers
etc.
Anga
• Capital: Champa

and West Bengal.
Magadha
• Capital: Girivraja/ Rajagriha
• Modern location: Gaya and Patna
• Magadha finds mention in the Atharva
Veda which conveys that Magadha
was semi-Brahmanical habitation.
• It was located in present day Bihar
close to Anga, divided by river
Champa.
• Later, Magadha became a center of
Jainism and the first Buddhist Council
was held in Rajagriha.
Kasi

Rise of Magadha
• Magadhan Empire:
 The Magadha Empire ruled in
India from 684 BC- 320 BC.
 It is also mentioned in the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana.
 It was the most powerful amongst
the sixteen mahajanapadas.
 The empire was established by
king Brihadratha.
Magadhan Empire
• Rajgaha (or Rajgir) was the capital
of Magadha but was later shifted
to Pataliputra in the fourth century
BCE.
• Iron was used to manufacture tools
and weapons.
• The elephants found in its forests
were used in the army.
• The riverine route of Ganga and its
tributaries made communication
cheap and convenient.
Magadhan Empire
• The implementation of policies by the
efficient bureaucracy of ruthless and
ambitious kings like Bimbisara, Ajatasattu
and Mahapadma Nanda made Magadha
prosperous.
• The first king of Magadha was Bimbisara
and he belonged to the Haryanka dynasty.
• Avanti was Magadha’s main rival but later
entered into an alliance.
• Marriages helped in building political
alliances and king Bimbisara married a lot
of princesses from nearby kingdoms.
The Haryanka Dynasty
• It was the second dynasty to rule over Magadha after
the Brihadratha dynasty.
• The dynasty was founded by king Bhattiya, the father
of Bimbisara.
• The dynasty ruled over Magadha from 6th century
BCE to 413 BCE.
• It was succeeded by the Shishunga dynasty.
The Haryanka Dynasty
• The kings of Haryanka dynasty are:
 Bhattiya
 Bimbisara
 Ajatasattu
 Udayabhadra
 Anuruddha
 Munda
 Nagadasaka
Bimbisara (546 – 494 BC)
• Contemporary of both Buddhism & jainism
• Set up his capital at Rajgir (Known as
Girivraja)
• Strengthened his position by marriage
alliances (Kosala, lichhavi (Vaishali) & madra
clan (Punjab))
• Acquired Anga under the viceroyality of
Ajatashatru.
• Fought with Pradyota of Avanti but later
became friends and sent a physician Jivaka
to Ujjain when he was attacked by Jaundice.
Bimbisara (546 – 494 BC)
• His religion is not very clear. While Buddhist
texts mention him as a disciple of Buddha, Jain
scriptures describe him as the follower of
Mahavir and refer to him as King Shrenika of
Rajgir.
• Known as Seniya. He was the ist king who had a
regular and standing army.
• Bimbisara was later imprisoned by his son
Ajatasattu who annexed the throne of
Magadha. Bimbisara later died during
imprisonment.
Ajatashatru
• Killed his father & succeeded to the throne
• Fought with Kosala & Vaishali (Lichhavis –
destroyed it in 16 years) & won both war
and expanded the kingdom of Magadha
• He fortified the capital city Rajgir.
• As it was surrounded by five hills, it
became almost impregnable.
• Embraced buddhism & led the foundation
for 1
st Budhhist council at Rajgir
Udayin
• Succesor of Ajatashatru + Founded new capital at Pataliputra (on the
confluence of the Son and the Ganges and shifted the capital from
Rajgriha to Pataliputra)
• His death marked the end of Haryanka dynasty
• Udayin was succeeded by the Shishunagas.
Shishunagas
• Temporary shifted the capital to Vaishali
• Defeated Avanti and it was the most important achievement of him &
bought end to 100 year old rivalry.
• Transferred capital from Vaishali to Patliputra.
• Shishunaga was succedded by Kalasoka (Kalavarna).
• He led the foundation of 2
nd Buddhist council.
• They were later succeeded by the Nanda dynasty
The Nanda Dynasty
• The dynasty lasted from 345 BCE321 BCE.
• Mahapadma Nanda, the first king
of the Nanda dynasty, added
Kalinga to the Magadhan Empire.
• He was considered to be so
powerful and ruthless that even
Alexander did not wish to fight
against him.
The Nanda Dynasty
• The Nanda dynasty became
immensely wealthy.
• They started irrigation projects and
standardized trade measures
across their kingdom.
• Harsh and inflexible taxation
system, however, made the
Nandas unpopular.
• The last Nanda king, Dhana Nanda,
was overthrown by Chandragupta
Maurya.
Mahapadmananda
• Known as Sarvakshatrantak i.e. uprooter of all
the Kshatriyas (Puranas) and Ugrasena i.e.
owner of huge army (Pali texts).
• Known as Ekarat (sole king who destroy
others).
• He is often described as ‘the first empire
builder of Indian History’.
• Conquered Kalinga & bought image of Jina as
trophy
• Hathigumpha inscription of kharavela King
(Kalinga) refers to conquest of Kalinga by
Nandas.
Dhanananda
• Last ruler of Nanda dynasty
• During his reign, Alexander
invaded India but did not
move ahead to east (Nanda’s
Power)
• Chandragupta Maurya &
Kautilya overthrew him as
oppressive way of tax
collection was already
resented by people
Cause of Magadha’s Success
• Among them Magadha, Vatsa, Avanti and
Kosala were the most prominent ones.
Out of these four, Magadha emerged as
the most powerful kingdom.
• The causes of Magadha’s success were as
following:
• Magadha was located on the upper and
lower parts of the Gangetic valley.
• It was located on the main land route
between west and east India.
• The area had fertile soil. It also received
enough rainfall.
• Magadha was encircled by rivers on three
sides, the Ganga, Son and Champa making
the region impregnable to enemies.
• Capitals: Rajgir (Surrounded by 5 hills),
• Patliputra (Surrounded by Ganga,
Gandhak, Son & Ghagra rivers
• Both Rajgir and Pataliputra were located in
strategic positions.
Economic factors
• Magadha had huge copper and iron deposits.
• Because of its location, it could easily control trade.
• Had a large population which could be used for agriculture, mining, building
cities and in the army.
• General prosperity of the people and the rulers.
• The mastery over Ganga meant economic hegemony. Ganga was important for
trade in North India.
• With the annexation of Anga by Bimbisara, river Champa was added to the
Magadha Empire. Champa was important in the trade with South-East Asia, Sri
Lanka and South India.
Cultural factors
• Magadhan society had an unorthodox character.
• It had a good mix of Aryan and non-Aryan peoples.
• Emergence of Jainism and Buddhism led to a revolution in terms of
philosophy and thought. They enhanced liberal traditions.
• Society was not so much dominated by the Brahmanas and many kings of
Magadha were ‘low’ in origins.
Political factors
• Magadha was lucky to have many powerful and ambitious rulers.
• They had strong standing armies.
• Availability of iron enabled them to develop advanced weaponry.
• They were also the first kings to use elephants in the army.
• The major kings also developed a good administrative system.

Making of the
Constitution
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

• It was in 1934 that the idea of a Constituent Assembly for India was put
forward for the first time by M. N. Roy, a pioneer of communist
movement in India and an advocate of radical democratism.
• In 1935, the Indian National Congress (INC), for the first time, officially
demanded a Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution of India.
• In 1938, Jawaharlal Nehru, on behalf the INC declared that ‘the
Constitution of free India must be framed, without outside interference,
by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise’.
• The demand was finally accepted in principle by the British Government
in what is known as the ‘August Offer’ of 1940.
Demand for a Constituent Assembly
• In 1942, Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the cabinet, came to India with a
draft proposal of the British Government on the framing of an
independent Constitution to be adopted after the World War II. The
Cripps Proposals were rejected by the Muslim League which wanted India
to be divided into two autonomous states with two separate Constituent
Assemblies.
• Finally, a Cabinet Mission was sent to India
 The Cabinet Mission consisting of three members (Lord Pethick Lawrence,
Sir Stafford Cripps and A V Alexander) arrived in India on March 24, 1946
and published its plan on May 16, 1946.
While it rejected the idea of two Constituent Assemblies, it put forth a
scheme for the Constituent Assembly which more or less satisfied the
Muslim League.
On December 13, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru moved the historic ‘Objectives
Resolution’ in the Assembly. It laid down the fundamentals and
philosophy of the constitutional structure.
Later it’s name changed to Preamble in the Constitution. ( Idea borrowed
from USA )
Objectives Resolution
• The Constituent Assembly was constituted in November 1946 under
the scheme formulated by the Cabinet Mission Plan. The features of
the scheme were:

Drafting Committee
• The motion on Draft Constitution was declared as passed on
November 26, 1949, and received the signatures of the members and
the president. This is also the date mentioned in the Preamble as the
date on which the people of India in the Constituent Assembly
adopted, enacted and gave to themselves this Constitution.
• The Constitution as adopted on November 26, 1949, contained a
Preamble, 395 Articles and 8 Schedules.
Enactment of the Constitution
• The major provisions of the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950.
This day is referred to in the Constitution as the ‘date of its commencement’,
and celebrated as the Republic Day.
• January 26 was specifically chosen as the ‘date of commencement’ of the
Constitution because of its historical importance. It was on this day in 1930
that Purna Swaraj day was celebrated, following the resolution of the Lahore
Session (December 1929) of the INC.
Enforcement of the Constitution
In addition to the making of the Constitution and enacting of ordinary laws,
the Constituent Assembly also performed the following functions:
1. It ratified the India’s membership of the Commonwealth in May 1949.
2. It adopted the national flag on July 22, 1947.
3. It adopted the national anthem on January 24, 1950.
4. It adopted the national song on January 24, 1950.
5. It elected Dr Rajendra Prasad as the first President of India on January
24, 1950.
Other Functions Performed by the
Constituent Assembly
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the then Law Minister, piloted the Draft Constitution in the
Assembly. He took a very prominent part in the deliberations of the Assembly. He
was known for his logical, forceful and persuasive arguments on the floor of the
Assembly. He is recognized as the ‘Father of the Constitution of India’.

Marine Coastline
Landforms
By Dr Vipan
Goyal

Marine Coastline Landforms
• The most powerful agents of marine erosion are waves. Their origin is due to the
sweeping of winds over the water surface.
• Sea waves, aided by winds, currents, tides and storms carry on the erosional and
depositional processes.
• The erosive work of the sea depends upon size and strength of waves, slope, height of
the shore between low and high tides, shape of the coast, composition of rocks, depth of
water, human activity etc.
• The wave pressure compresses the air trapped inside rock fissures, joints, faults, etc.
forcing it to expand and rupture the rocks along weak points.
• This is how rocks undergo weathering under wave action.
Marine Coastline Landforms
• Waves also use rock debris as instruments of erosion (glaciers are quite good at
this).
• These rock fragments carried by waves themselves get worn down by striking
against the coast or against one another.
• The solvent or chemical action of waves is another mode of erosion, but it is
pronounced only in case of soluble rocks like limestone and chalk.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Capes and Bays:
• On exposed coasts, the continual action of
waves on rocks of varying resistance causes
the coastline to be eroded irregularly.
• E.g. The softer rocks are worn back into
inlets, cover or bays and the harder ones
persist as headlands or capes.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Wave-Cut Platform
 When the sea waves strike against a cliff,
the cliff gets eroded (lateral erosion)
gradually.
 The waves level out the shore region to
carve out a horizontal plane or a wave-cut
platform.
 The bottom of the cliff suffers the
maximum intensive erosion by waves and,
as a result, a notch appears at this position.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Sea Cliff
• The most widespread landforms of erosional
coasts are sea cliffs.
• Generally, any very steep rock face adjoining the
coast forms a cliff from a few m to 30 m or even
more.
• Their steep nature is the result of wave-induced
erosion near sea level and the subsequent
collapse of rocks at a higher elevation.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Sea Caves
• Prolonged attack of waves against the
base of the cliff and the rock debris that
gets smashed against the cliff along with
lashing waves create holes in regions of
weakness and get further widened and
deepened to form sea caves.
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Sea Arches
• When two caves approach one another
from either side of a headland and unite,
they form a bridge like structure, known as
arch
• These archways may have an arcuate or
rectangular shape, with the opening
extending below water level and can be up
to tens of metres above sea level.
• It formed when the waves attack a rockform from two opposite sides, the
differential erosion
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Stacks/Skarries/Chimney Rock
 When a portion of the sea arch
collapses, the remaining column-like
structure is called a stack, skarry or
chimney rock.
 The seaward portion of headland will
remain as an isolated pillar of rock
known as stack
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Stump
• The stack is gradually eroded,
leaving behind only the stump
• Stumps are only just visible
above the sea level
Marine Erosional Landforms
• Blow Holes or Spouting Horns
 The burst of water through a small hole on a sea cave
due to the compression of air in the cave by strong
waves. They make a peculiar noise.
• Geos
• The enlargement of blow-holes and
the continued action of waves weaken
the cave roof.
• When the roof collapses a long,
narrow inlet or creek develops.
• Such long and deep clefts are called
Geos

Marine Depositional Landforms
• Beach
• This is the temporary covering of rock debris on or
along a wave-cut platform.
• Beaches are characteristic of shorelines that are
dominated by deposition but may occur as patches
along even the rugged shores.
• Sands and gravels loosened from the land are
moved by waves to be deposited along the shore as
beaches
• Beaches called shingle beaches contain excessively
small pebbles and even cobbles.
Marine Depositional Landforms
• Bar
• Currents and tidal currents deposit rock
debris and sand along the coast at a
distance from the shoreline.
• The resultant landforms which remain
submerged are called bars.
• The off-shore bars and barriers commonly
form across the mouth of a river or at the
entrance of a bay.
• Bars are submerged features and when bars
show up above water, they are called
barrier bars.
• Generally, bars are approximately parallel to
the coast
Marine Depositional Landforms
• Barrier
• It is the overwater counterpart of a bar
• An off-shore bar which is exposed due
to further addition of sand is termed a
barrier bar and are commonly form
across the mouth of a river or at the
entrance of a bay.
• They usually occur in chains
• They are subject to change during
storms and other action, but absorb
energy and protect the coastlines
Marine Depositional Landforms
• Spit and Hook
 A spit is a projected deposition joined at
one end to the headland, with the other
end free in the sea.
 The mode of formation is similar to a bar
or barrier.
 A shorter spit with one end curved
towards the land is called a Hook
Marine Depositional Landforms
• Tombolos
• Sometimes, islands are
connected to each other by a bar
called tombolo.
• The tombolo is a deposition
landform in which an island is
attached to the mainland by a
narrow piece of lands such as a
spit or bar.
• A tombolo is a sandy isthmus.
Coastlines
• The boundary between the coast (the part of the land adjoining or near
the sea) and the shore (the land along the edge of a sea) is known as the
coastline.
• Coastline are modified either due to rise or fall in sea levels or upliftment
or subsidence of land, or both.
Coastlines
• Coastline of Emergence
• Coastline of Submergence
• Neutral coastline
Coastlines can be divided into the following classes:
Coastlines of Emergence
• Faulting and earth movement may
thrust up coastal plateau so that the
whole region is raised, with consequent
emergent features.
• Bars, spits, lagoons, salt marshes,
beaches, sea cliffs and arches are the
typical features.
• The east coast of India, especially its
south-eastern part (Tamil Nadu coast)
and Malabar coast (Kerala) appears to
be a coast of emergence.
Coastlines of Submergence
• A submerged coast is produced
either by subsidence of land or by
a rise in sea level.
• Konkan coast/ Maharashtra and
Goa Coast are the examples of
Coastline of submergence
• Ria, fjord, Dalmatian and drowned
lowlands are its typical features.
Ria Coast
• When a region is dissected by
streams into a system of valleys and
divides, submergence produces a
highly irregular shoreline called ria
coastline.
• A Ria coast is typical of the Atlantic
type of coast like those of north-west
France, north-west Spain, south-west
Ireland.
Fjord Coast
• These coasts have long and narrow inlets
with very steep sides.
• They mark the paths of glaciers that
plunged down from the highlands.
• Due to the greater intensity of ice erosion
fiords are deep for distances.
• E.g. Norway, Alaska, British Columbia,
southern Chile and the South Island of New
Zealand.
Dalmatian
• The Dalmatian coasts result by
submergence of mountain ridges
with alternating crests and troughs
which run parallel to the sea coast.
• This is the longitudinal coast where
mountains run parallel or
concordant to the coast.
• The Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia
is a typical example.
Drowned lowland
• A drowned lowland is formed by the
submergence of a low-lying area.
• It is characterized by a series of bars
running parallel to the coast, enclosing
lagoons.
• The Baltic coast of eastern Germany is an
example of this type of coastline.
Neutral Coastlines
• These are coastlines formed as a
result of new materials being built
out into the water.
• The word ‘neutral’ implies that
there need be no relative change
between the level of sea and the
coastal region of the continent.

Matter
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Matter
• Matter is considered as any thing which has weight and occupies
space.
• It exists in three states: Solid, liquid and gas.
• In solid, molecules vibrate about fixed positions.
• In liquid, molecules also vibrate but simultaneously they move
freely throughout the material.
• In gas, the molecules are much farther apart than in solids and
liquids and move at high velocities.
Inter-atomic Forces
• The electrostatic force of interaction acting between the two or
more atoms is called inter-atomic forces.
• The range of inter-atomic forces is equal to the order of atomic size,
i.e. 10−10 m.
• A force which changes the configuration of a body is called a
deforming force.
Solid
• It is that, state of matter which has definite shape and definite
volume. In this state molecules are very closely packed.
• Properties of Solids
 Elasticity
o The property of a body by virtue of which it regain its
original configuration after the removal of deforming force,
is called elasticity.
o Quartz/silicon dioxide (SiO2
) and phosphor bronze are almost
perfectly elastic bodies.
Properties of Solids
• Plasticity
 The property of a body by virtue of which it doesn’t regain its original
configuration after the removal of deforming force, is called plasticity.
• Strain
 The fractionaI change in configuration i.e. length, volume and shape, is called
strain. Strain has no unit.
 On the basis of change in configuration, strain is of three types
 Longitudinal strain = Δ𝐼/ 𝐼
 Volume strain = Δ𝑉/𝑉
 Shearing strain = θ (ratio of relative displacement of any layer to its
perpendicular distance from fixed layer.)
• Stress
 The internal restoring force acting per unit area of crosssection of a deformed body is called stress. Its unit is
kg⋅m−1
⋅s
−2 and Dimension: M L
−1 T
−2
 Stress is of two types
 Normal stress : occurs when a member is loaded by an
axial force.
 Tangential stress : When the direction of the deforming
force or external force is parallel to the cross-sectional
area. This results in the change in the shape of the body.
 The maximum deforming force up-to which a body retains
its property of elasticity is called the limit of elasticity of
the material body.
 The minimum stress required to break a wire is called
breaking stress.
 Torque : A force that tends to cause rotation. it has units of Newtonmeters. Torque can be written as T = F * r * sin(theta),
 The torque required to produce a given twist in a hollow cylinder is
greater than that required to produce the same twist in a solid cylinder.
Therefore, hollow shaft is stronger than a solid shaft.
 Young's modulus of elasticity: Y=
longitudinal stress/ longitudinal strain
 Young's modulus describes
tensile elasticity, or the tendency of an
object to deform along an axis when
opposing forces are applied along that
axis; it is defined as the ratio of tensile
stress to tensile strain. It is often
referred to simply as the elastic
modulus. Its units are (N/m2
).
 Springs are made of steel, not of
copper as Young's modulus of elasticity
of steel is more than that of copper.
 Hook's law : states that the force needed to
compress or extend a spring is directly
proportional to the distance you stretch it.
 Represented as F = kx, where F is the force we
apply, k is the spring constant, and x is the
extension of the material (typically in meters).
 Its Sl unit is Nm-2 also called pascal.
 Under elastic limit, stress is proportional to
strain.
 stress x strain
 Stress = strain E (constant) E is called elastic
constant or modulus of elasticity. Its value is
different for different material.
 Bulk modulus of elasticity : It is
a modulus associated with a volume
strain, when a volume is compressed.
 Bulk modulus = ( pressure applied /
fractional change in volume).
 It is denoted with a symbol of K. It has
the dimension of force per unit area.
 The bulk modulus concept is mostly
applied in liquids.
 Bulk modulus is the measure of the
decrease in volume with an increase
in pressure.
• Rigidity modulus/ shear modulus : It is defined
as “the ratio of shear stress to the
displacement per unit sample length
(shear strain).
• It is defined as a material property with a value
equal to the shear stress divided by
the shear strain.
• Shear stress arises from the force vector
component parallel to the cross section of the
material.
• Shear strain is the ratio of the change
in deformation to its original length
perpendicular to the axes of the member due
to shear stress.
Properties of Solids
• Elastic Limit
 It is the limit of stress and strain upto which a wire remains elastic.
• Plastic Behaviour
 If the wire is stretched beyond the elastic limit, the strain increases
much more rapidly. If the stretching force is removed, the wire does
not come back to its natural length.
• Fracture Point
 If the deformation is increased further the plastic behaviour, the wire
breaks at a point known as fracture point.
Properties of Solids
• Ductile and Brittle Materials
 If large deformation takes place between the elastic limit and the fracture
point, the material is called ductile. (drawn out into a thin wire).
 If the wire breaks soon after the elastic limit is crossed, it is called brittle.
• Elastic Fatigue
 It is the property of an elastic body by virtue of which its behaviour
becomes less elastic under the action of repeated alternating deforming
force.
 Due to elastic fatigue, the bridges become less elastic after a use of long
time and therefore are declared unsafe.
Fluid
• A substance which begins to flow under an external force is called a fluid.
Liquids and gases are fluids.
• Fluid Density
 The ratio of mass to the volume of a body is called its density. (i.e.
mass present in its unit volume). It is a scalar quantity having SI unit
kg/𝑚3.
 The density of water is 1000 kg/𝑚3.
 The density of water is maximum at 4°C.
• Hydrometer It is an instrument used to measure density or relative
density of liquid. Its working is based on law of floatation.
Pressure
• Pressure is defined as the force applied per unit surface area. It is a scalar
quantity.
 Pressure= Force applied/Area of Surface
 The SI unit of Pressure is N/m2 which is called Pascal.
• Fluid Pressure
 Thrust (the normal force) exerted by a liquid per unit area of the
surface in contact at rest, is called fluid pressure.
 Fluid pressure (p) = 𝐹/ 𝐴
 Its unit is 𝑁𝑚−2 or Pascal (Pa).
Pressure
• Atmospheric Pressure
 The pressure exerted by the atmosphere, is called atmospheric pressure.
 Aneroid barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure and height of
a place.
 Units of atmospheric pressure are torr and bar.
 It is the pressure which is exerted by mercury column of 76 cm length at 00
C at 450 latitude at sea level. It is measured in bar.
 1 bar 105 N/m2 Atmospheric pressure 1 atm 1.01 bar 760 torr.
Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.
 That is why it is difficult to cook on the mountain and fountain pen of a
passenger leaks in aeroplane at height.
• Sudden fall in barometric reading is the indication of storm.
• Slow fall in barometric reading is indication of rain.
• Slow rise in barometric reading is indication of clear weather.
• Pressure in Fluids: Force exerted on unit area of wall or base of the
container by the molecules of liquid is the pressure of liquid.
• Pressure exerted by a liquid at depth h below the surface of liquid is P =hdg
where d is density of liquid.
• In a static liquid at same horizontal level, pressure is same at all points.
• Pascal’s Law
 The pressure exerted anywhere
at a point of confined fluid is
transmitted equally and
undiminished, in all directions
throughout the liquid.
 Hydraulic lift, hydraulic press,
hydraulic brakes works on the
basis of Pascal’s law.

Buoyancy
• When a body is partially or wholly
immersed in a liquid, an upward force
acts on it, which is called buoyant force or
upthrust and this property of fluids is
called buoyancy.
• Buoyant force is equal to the weight of
the liquid displaced by the submerged
part of the body.
• The buoyant force acts at the centre of
gravity of the liquid displaced by the
submerged part of the body, which is
called ‘centre of buoyancy’.
• Relative density is measured by Hydrometer.
• The density of sea water is more than that of normal water. This explains
why it is easier to swim in sea water.
• When ice floats in water, its 1/10 part remains outside the water. If ice
floating in water in a vessel melts, the level of water in the vessel does not
change.
• Purity of milk is measured by lactometer.
Archimedes Principle
• When a body is partially or
completely immersed in a
liquid, it loses some of its
weight.
• The loss in weight is equal to
the weight of the liquid
displaced by the submerged
part of the body.
Law of Floatation
• A body will float in a liquid if weight of the
body is equal weight of the liquid
displaced by the immersed part of the
body.
• In floating condition, the centre of gravity
(g) and the centre of buoyancy (B) of the
floating body must lie on the same straight
line.
• Ice and large icebergs float on water
surface as its density (0.92 g/cm3) is lesser
than the density of water.
• When a piece of ice floats on water, its
(11/ 12) 𝑡ℎ part submerged in water and
(1/12) th part is outside the water.
• In sea water, (8/ 9) th part of icebergs is submerged and (1/9) th part is
outside the water during floating.
• It is easier to swim in sea water than in a river as density of sea water is
greater than the density of river water. In sea water, buoyant force is
greater than that in river water.
• The density of human body is less than the density of water but the
density of human head is greater than the density of water. Therefore,
during swimming a person displaces the liquid with hands and legs and
total weight of displaced liquid becomes equal to the weight of the body.
• A ballon filled with a light gas, such as hydrogen rises because the average
density of the ballon and the gas is less than that of the air.
• A submarine has large ballast tank. When these tanks are filled with water,
the average density of the submarine becomes more than that of water
can dive easily.
• When the submarine is ready to come at surface, compressed air is forced
into the ballast tanks forcing the water out, thus reducing the density of
submarine which can then rise.
Surface Tension
• The property of a liquid by virtue of which it tries to minimise its free
surface area is called surface tension.
• The minimum surface area of a given amount of liquid is for spherical
shape. Therefore, rain drops are spherical.
• Surface tension of a liquid becomes zero at critical temperature. (Critical
temperature is the highest temperature at which a gas can be turned into
liquid using pressure.)
• Surface Tension = Force/Length
Surface Tension
• Factors Affecting Surface Tension
 Temperature : The surface tension of a liquid decreases with
increase in temperature because cohesive forces decrease
with an increase of molecular thermal activity.
 Soluble Impurities : If the impurities are less soluble in liquid,
then its surface tension decreases. If impurities are highly
soluble in liquid, then its surface tension increases.
Applications of Surface Tension
• When soap, detergent, dettol, phenyl etc., are mixed in water then its surface
tension decreases.
• When salt is added in water, its surface tension increases because addition of
solute into solvent may lead to an increase in surface tension, such
as salt in water and water in alcohol, due to solute depletion at the interface.
• When oil spreads over the surface of water, its surface tension decreases.
• When kerosene oil is sprinkled on water, its surface tension decreases. As a result,
the larva of mosquitoes floating on the surface of water dies due to sinking.
• Warm soup is tasty because at high temperature its surface tension is low and
consequently the soup spreads on all parts of the tongue.
Applications of Surface Tension
• Antiseptics like dettol have low surface tension and therefore it reaches in
the tiny cracks of the wound and cleans the germs and bacteria.
• The surface tension of soap solution in water is less than the surface
tension of pure water. Therefore, soap solution cleans greasy strains of
clothes better than pure water.
• Lubricating oil spread easily on all parts because of their low surface
tension.
• Dirt get removed when detergents are added while washing clothes
because surface tension of water is reduced.
Capillarity
• The phenomenon of rising or falling of liquid
column in a capillary tube (glass tube of very
fine bore) is called capillarity.
• Illustrations of capillarity
 1. A piece of blotting paper soaks ink
because the pores of the blotting paper
serve as capillary tubes.
 2. The oil in the wick of a lamp rises due
to capillary action of threads in the wick.
 3. The root hairs of plants draw water
from the soil through capillary action.
Capillarity
 4. To prevent loss of water due to capillary action, the soil is loosened
and split into pieces by the farmers.
 5. If a capillary tube is dipped in water in an artificial satellite, water
rises up to other end of tube because of its zero apparent weight, how
long the tube may be.
 6. Action of towel in soaking up water from the body is due to capillary
action of cotton in the towel.
 7. Melted wax, in a candle rises up to wick by capillary action.
Cohesive and Adhesive Forces
• Cohesive force: The intermolecular force of
attraction acting between the molecules of
same substance is called cohesive force.
 E.g., Intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of water,
mercury etc.
• Adhesive force: The intermolecular force of
attraction acting between the molecules of
different substance is called adhesive force.
 E.g., Intermolecular force of attraction
acting between the molecules of paper
and gum, paper and ink, etc.
Viscous force and Viscosity
• Viscous force: The force which opposes the relative motion between
different layers of liquid or gases is called viscous force.
• Viscosity: Viscosity is the property of a liquid by virtue of which it opposes
the relative motion between its different layers.
 Viscosity is the property of liquids and gases both.
 The viscosity of a liquid is due to cohesive force between its
molecules.
 The viscosity of a gas is due to diffusion of its molecules from one layer
to other layer.
Viscous force and Viscosity
 Viscosity of gases is much less than that of liquids. There is no viscosity
in solids.
 Viscosity of an ideal fluid is zero.
 With rise in temperature, viscosity of liquids decreases and that for
gases increases. (When temperature increases the energy level
of liquid molecules increases and the distance between the
molecule increases. It causes a decrease in intermolecular attraction
between them, which reduce viscosity.)
 Viscosity of a fluid is measured by its coefficient of viscosity. Its SI unit
is decapoise (kg/ms) or pascal second. It is generally denoted by η.
Stoke’s Law
• According to this law, the viscous force depends upon the coefficient of
viscosity, velocity of the moving object and its size. Or
• The force required to move a sphere through a given viscous fluid at a low
uniform velocity is directly proportional to the velocity and radius of the
sphere.
Terminal Velocity
• When a small spherical body falls through a long liquid column its velocity
increases gradually but later on it becomes constant, called terminal
velocity.
• The radius of spherical rain drops is very small therefore their terminal
velocity is also small, with which they strike the earth’s surface.
• When a liquid flow through a pipe, its speed is maximum near axis and
minimum near the walls of the pipe because fluid with in contact with
solid surface will resist the motion.
Equation of Continuity
• When a non-viscous liquid flows through a pipe of non-uniform crosssectional area in stream-lined flow, (i.e. velocity at every point in the fluid
remains constant) then at each section of the tube, the product of area of
cross-section of the pipe and velocity of liquid remains constant, i.e. A × v
= constant.
• Therefore speed (v) of fluid flow becomes faster in narrower pipe.
Bernoulli’s Theorem
• If a non-viscous and incompressible liquid
is flowing in stream-lined flow then total
energy, i.e., sum of pressure energy, kinetic
energy and potential energy, per unit
volume of the liquid remains constant.
• Venturi tube and aspirator pump works on
Bernoulli’s theorem.
• Venturi tube are used to measure the flow
speed of a fluid in a tube
• Aspirator pump is used to spray the liquid.
• According to Bernoulli's theorem, with
increase in velocity of liquid its pressure
decreases and vice-versa.
• Standing by the side of fast moving train is dangerous, due to the high velocity
of the train, pressure is low and there is flow of pressure (outside), from high
pressure to low pressure, and it can withdraw the man toward the high speed
train.
• Lift on an aircraft wing is based on Bernouli’s principle.
• During storms or cyclones, the roofs of the huts or tinned roofs blown off
because wind blows with very high speed over the top of the roof and
therefore pressure of air decreases.
• Due to the pressure difference of air above and below the roof, a lifting force
acts on the roof. If it is sufficient to balance the weight of the roof it starts to
fly off.
Magnus Effect
• Magnus Effect:
• The force exerted on a rapidly spinning
cylinder or sphere moving through air or
another fluid in a direction at an angle
to the axis of spin. This force is
responsible for the swerving of balls
when hit or thrown with spin.
• Motion of a Spinning Ball
• When swing bowlers deliver the ball,
the ball changes its plane of motion in
air.
Simple Harmonic Motion/ periodic motion:
• Any motion which repeats itself after regular interval of time is called
periodic or harmonic motion.
• Ex. Motion of hands of a clock, motion of earth around sun etc.
• Oscillatory motion: if a particle repeats its motion after a regular interval
of time about a fixed point, motion is said to be oscillatory or vibratory.
• Ex. Motion of a piston in engines.
• Time period: time taken in one complete oscillation.
• Frequency: number of oscillation completed by a body in unit interval of
time. Its SI unit is hertz. If n = frequency, T = time period, then n-1
• If a particle repeats its motion about a fixed point after regular interval of time in
such a way that at any moment the acceleration of the particle is directly
proportional to its displacement from the fixed point at that moment and is always
directed towards the fixed point.
• The fixed point is called mean point or equilibrium point.
• Characteristics : When a particle executing SHM passes through the mean position
• No force acts on the particle
• Acceleration of the particle is zero.
• Velocity is maximum.
• Kinetic energy is maximum .
• Potential energy is zero.
• When the particle executing SHM is at extreme end ,then
• 1. Acceleration is maximum
• 2. Restoring force acting on particle is maximum.
• 3. Velocity of particle is maximum.
• 4. Kinetic energy is zero.
• 5. Potential energy is maximum.
• Simple pendulum :
• Time period = T = 2π × √(L/g)
• Where l = length of pendulum.

Mauryas
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Rise of the Mauryas
• The last of the Nanda rulers, Dhana Nanda was highly
unpopular due to his oppressive tax regime.
• Also, post Alexander’s invasion of North-Western India, that
region faced a lot of unrest from foreign powers.
• Chandragupta, with the help of an intelligent and politically
astute Brahmin, Kautilya usurped the throne by defeating
Dhana Nanda in 321 BC.
Mauryan Empire
(321 – 184 BC)
• The Mauryan Empire
was spread from the
valley of the Oxus
(present Amu
River)/central asia to
the delta of Kaveri
Mauryan Empire (321 – 184 BC)
Chandragupta Maurya was the first ruler who unified entire India under one political
unit.
The detailed information about the administrative system of the Mauryan Empire is
mentioned in Arthashastra.
It is a book written by Kautilya. He was also known as Chanakya.
Kautilya was the Prime Minister of Chandragupta Maurya. He was considered as the
real architect of the Mauryan Empire.
Literary Sources

• Megasthene was a Greek ambassador in court
of Chandragupta maurya
• His book is survived in fragments & provides
detail about mauryan administration & military
organization, particularly of capital city
(Patliputra).
• He called Pataliputra as PolimBrotha. And it was
handled by six committees (each have 5
members).
Chandragupta Maurya
• The Hindu sources also say he was
a student of Kautilya of humble
birth (probably born to a Shudra
woman).
• Most Buddhist sources say he was
a Kshatriya.
• It is generally accepted that he was
an orphaned boy born into a
humble family who was trained by
Kautilya
Chandragupta Maurya
• The Buddhist literature, the ‘Mahavamsa’ and ‘Dipavamsa’ give a detail
account of Chandragupta Maurya.
• Chandragupta Maurya has been described as a descendant of the
Kshatriya clan of the Moriyas branch of Sakyas. They lived in Pipphalivana,
in eastern Uttar Pradesh.
• The ‘Mudrarakshasa’ is a play written by Vishakhadatta, referred
Chandragupta as ‘Vrishala’ and ‘Kulahina,’ which means a person of
humble origin.
Chandragupta Maurya
• Founded Mauryan Empire by
defeating Nandas with the help of
Kautilya
• In 305 BC, he marched against
Selucus Nikator (Alexanders
general controlling NW India) &
defeated him.
Chandragupta Maurya
• A treaty was signed, according to which, Selucus gave Chandragupta
eastern Afganisthan, Baluchistan & area west of Indus & in return
Chandragupta gifted 500 elephants to Selucus & married his daughter
Helen.
• Megasthenes was sent to Mauryan court as a Greek ambassador
• Greek writer Justin (Who wrote epitome) called Chandragupta
“Sandrocottus”
Chandragupta Maurya
• Chandragupta embraced Jainism towards the end of his life & stepped
down from the throne in favour of his son Bindusara & went to Mysore
along with Jain monks led by Bhadrabahu & starved himself to death.
• The Junagarh rock inscription describes that a dam for irrigation was
constructed on the Sudarshana Lake by Pushyagupta, a provincial
governor of Chandragupta Maurya.
• The Jain tradition confirms that in his old age, Chandragupta abdicated the
throne and retired to Shravanabelagola in Karnataka with his teacher
Bhadrabahu (a Jain ascetic).
Chandragupta Maurya
• Local inscriptions of the later
period mentioned that
Chandragupta gave up his life as a
Jaina devotee by fast unto death
at a hill, which later on called as
Chandragiri, seems to be named
after him.
Bindusara
• Was called “Amitragatha” i.e. Slayer of foes
by the Greeks.
• According to the Tibetan historian,
Taranath, Chanakya continued as a minister
of Bindusara after Chandragupta Maurya.

this fact.
• He opt the Ajivika sect ( founded by
Makkhali Gosala, major rival of Vedic,
Jainism and Buddhism)
• Conquered Deccan upto Mysore.
Bindusara
• Nikator’s successor Antiochus 1 replaced Megasthenes with Deimachus as
a Greek ambassador at mauryan court under Bindusara’s Patronage.
• Bindusara appointed his eldest son Sumana (or Susima) as his viceroy at
Taxila and Ashoka at Ujjain.
• It also mentions that when a revolt broke out at Taxila, Ashoka was sent to
restore peace as Susima fails to suppress it.
Ashoka
• According to the Buddhist tradition,
Janapada Kalyani or Subhadrangi was
his mother.
• He was appointed as a viceroy of Ujjain
and Taxila while he was a prince.
• Ashoka was very cruel in his early life
and captured the throne after killing his
99 brothers. But it appears an
exaggerated figure.
Ashoka
• At its zenith, Ashoka’s empire stretched
from Afghanistan in the west to
Bangladesh in the east. It covered
almost the whole Indian subcontinent
except present Kerala and Tamil Nadu,
and modern-day Sri Lanka.
• Ashoka built many edicts all over India
including in present-day Nepal and
Pakistan.
• His capital was at Pataliputra (Patna)
and had provincial capitals at Taxila and

Foreign invasions
Ashoka’s policies
Brahminical reaction
• Kalhana, author of the work Rajatarangini which is an account of Kashmir’s history says
that after Ashoka’s death, his son Jalauka ruled over Kashmir as an independent ruler.
This partition resulted in invasions from the northwest.
• Kalinga became independent.

were the Indo-Greeks, the Sakas and the Kushanas.
Mauryan Art
• No significant architectural remains have been found corresponding
to the period between the Harappans and the Mauryas.
• This is probably because buildings were not made of stone in this
period.

other natural calamities.

use of wood to stone.

th century BC, Mauryas established their power and by 3
rdcentury BC
Ashoka patronized Shraman tradition.

The period from 1905 to 1917 was known as the era of extremism in the
Indian National Movement.
The extremists or the aggressive nationalists believed that success could
be achieved through bold means.
The important extremist leaders were Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar
Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh.
 Bal Gangadhar Tilak is regarded as the real founder of the popular
 anti-British movement in India.
 He was known as ‘Lokmanya’.
 He attacked the British through his weeklies ‘The Mahratta’ and the ‘Kesari’.
 Started Akharas, Lathi clubs and anti – cow killing societies to built his rapport
 Build up anti-imperialist sentiments among the public through Ganapati festivals
(started in 1893), Shivaji festivals (started in 1896)
 He was jailed twice by the British for his nationalist activities and in 1908 deported
to Mandalay for six years.
 Books : The Arctic Home of Vedas & Gita Rahasya
 He set up the Home Rule League in 1916 at Poona and declared “Swaraj is my
birth-right and I will have it.”
Lala Lajpat Rai
 popularly known as the ‘Lion of Punjab’ and ‘Punjab Kesari’ (no Link to the newspaper)
 He played an important role in the Arya Samaj and the Swadeshi Movement
 He founded the Indian Home Rule League in the US in 1916
 Deported to Mandalay on the ground of sedition in 1907
 Founded the : Servants of the People Society and National College, at Lahore
 He received fatal injuries while leading a procession against the Simon
Commission and died on November 17, 1928.
Bipin Chandra Pal
He began his career as a moderate and turned an extremist.
Prolific writer on nationalistic issues
Aurobindo Ghosh was another extremist leader who actively
participated in the Swadeshi Movement. He was also imprisoned. After
his release he settled in the French territory of Pondicherry and
concentrated on spiritual activities
Causes for the Rise of Extremism
 Failure of the Moderates to win any notable success other than the
expansion of the legislative councils by the Indian Councils Act (1892)
 During the great famines of 1896-97 and 1899-1900, British did not
take any serious famine relief measures (or failed at them).
Approximately 90 lakh people died; moderates were unable to force
British to take any measures.
 Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 in which Japan defeated a great
European power Russia.
 This encouraged Indians to fight against the European nation, Britain.
 The economic conditions of the people became worse
 The ill-treatment of Indians in South Africa on the basis of colour of
skin
The immediate cause for the rise of extremism was the reactionary rule
of Lord Curzon:
 He passed the Calcutta Corporation Act, (1899) reducing the Indian
control of this local body.
 The Universities Act (1904) reduced the elected members in the
University bodies. It also reduced the autonomy of the universities and
made them government departments.
 The Sedition Act and the Official Secrets Act reduced the freedoms of
all people.
 His worst measure was the Partition of Bengal (1905).
Main Objective of Extremists :
Their main objective was to attain Swaraj (self – rule) and not just better
governance from British.
*the exact definition of Swaraj/degree of independence was still vague. Became clear only in
1929 with the ‘Purna Swaraj’ resolution
Methods of the Extremists
 The Extremists had no faith in the British sense of justice and fair play.
 They pointed out the forceful means by which the British had taken control
of India.
 They believed that political rights will have to be fought for.
 They had the spirit of self-reliance and self determination.
The methods used by the extremists were:
1. Not cooperating with the British Government by boycotting government
courts, schools and colleges.
2. Promotion of Swadeshi and boycott of foreign goods.(economic aspect)
3. Introduction and promotion of nationalistic education
*University of Calcutta = Ghulam khana
The achievements of extremists can be summed up as follows:
1.They were the first to demand Swaraj as a matter of birth right.
2.They involved the masses in the freedom struggle and broadened the social base
of the National Movement.
3.They were the first to organize an all-India political movement, viz. the
Swadeshi Movement.

Monetary System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Monetary Policy
• It is the Component of Economic Policy through Which Central Bank
regulates Money Supply in an Economy
• It is the method through which the Central Bank regulates money
supply in the market
Objectives of Monetary Policy
• To Stimulate Economic Growth
• To Control Inflation
• Controlled Expansion Of Bank Credit
• Promotion of Fixed Investment
• Restriction of Inventories : The main objective of this policy is to avoid over-stocking
and idle money in the organization which leads to sickness of the organization.
• Promotion of Exports and Food Procurement Operations
• Desired Distribution of Credit
• Equitable Distribution of Credit
• To Promote Efficiency
• RBI reviews its monetary policy every two months.
Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC)
• Decides policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target
• The Central Government has notified 4 percent Consumer Price
Index (CPI) inflation as the target for the period from August 5,
2016, to March 31, 2021, with the upper tolerance limit of 6
percent and the lower tolerance limit of 2 percent.
• 4 Mandatory Meetings,
• Quorum- 4 Members
• 1 Member= 1 Vote, in the event of an equality, the Governor has a
second or casting vote.
Instruments of Monetary Policy
• Also known as Credit Control measures or Monetary Policy Measure
• Broadly classified into two types:-
 Quantitative or General Measures
 Qualitative or Selective Measures
• Difference between Quantitative and Qualitative measures
 1. Quantitative measures regulate the quantity of money supply
 2. Qualitative measures are sector specific
Quantitative Measures
• 1. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
 Percentage of bank deposits which the bank has to keep with
RBI
• 2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
 Percentage of bank deposits which the bank has to keep with
itself
 Cash
 Government Securities
 Gold
Quantitative Measures
• 2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
 Objectives of SLR
o 1. To ensure that bank should maintain sufficient cash with
themselves
o 2. To Induce Banks to buy Government Securities
• 3. Bank Rate
 Rate of interest at which RBI provides rediscounting facilities to
Banks against Commercial Paper.
Quantitative Measures
• 4. Open Market Operations (OMO)
 It is done by buying and selling Government Securities
 This is done by an auction process
 Another component of OMO is Liquidity Adjustment Facility.
 This is used to regulate the money supply in the country
 LAF is done by – Repo and Reverse Repo Rate
Quantitative Measures
Repo Rate – RBI lends money to Banks by buying government
securities
 RBI only fixes Repo rate, Reverse Repo is automatically adjusted
to 1% point below the Repo rate.
E.g. – If Repo Rate is changed to 8% Reverse Repo Rate will be
automatically adjusted to 7%
o Reverse Repo Rate – At this rate banks buy government securities
from RBI
• When Repo and reverse Repo increases, Money Supply in the market
decreases and when Repo and reverses Repo decreases Money Supply in
the market increases.
Quantitative Measures
• Per cent v/s Per cent Point
 1 per cent point = 100 basis point
 i.e. 10% + 1% point = 10+1 = 11%
 whereas 10% + 1% = 10+0.1 = 10.1%
• Cash Management Bills (CMB) to suck excess liquidity.
• While the money thus collected is not part of Govt.’s borrowing, but
Govt. pays interest on it.
• This mechanism was enhanced during Demonetization to counter
excess liquidity and crashing of lending rates.
Quantitative Measures
• 5. Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)
 Banks can borrow loan up to 1% on their deposits.
 Interests will be 1% point above Repo Rate and it will be based
on day to day basis.
 This facility is created to facilitate borrowing from RBI by banks
who do not haven extra government securities and pledging the
existing securities will affect their SLR requirements of 23%.
 Objective was to overcome liquidity crunch with banks i.e.
shortage of funds.
Qualitative Measures
• 1. Credit Rationing
 Quota of credit, i.e. priority sector to get 40% of total credit.
 Priority sector includes:-
o Agricultural Sector (18% of total credit)
o Weaker Sections
o Small Scale Industry
 For Foreign banks priority sector cap is 32% of total credit
Qualitative Measures
 Priority sector includes Exports, Small Scale Industries, Housing
Sector, Education Loan
 M.V Nair committee in 2012 recommended that quota for
foreign banks should be increased to 40%
• 2. Margin Requirements
 Difference between the market value of a collateral security and
the maximum amount of loan sanctioned against that security
by a bank in a particular sector
Qualitative Measures
• 3. Differential Rate of Interest
 Different rate of interest for different sectors to increase the flow of
credit to those sectors like agriculture sector, small scale industries
• 4. Other Measures
 Moral Suasion - “Persuasion” without applying punitive measures. RBI
governor tries this tactic via conferences, informal meetings, letters,
seminars, convocation, panel discussion, memorial lectures. -
Example, Governor asking Banks to transmit rate cuts, open new
branches in rural areas, spread financial literacy, give loans to farmers
beyond PSL quota etc.
Qualitative Measures
• Similarly, Governor asking CM/FM to control fiscal deficit & subsidy
leakage to enhance the impact of RBI’s monetary policy.
 Direct Action like Penalty or Sanctions
• RBI can punish banks (and even non-banks) for not complying with
its directives under RBI Act 1934, Banking Regulation Act 1949,
Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 ,
• Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002, Foreign Exchange
Management Act (FEMA) 1999.
Types of Monetary System
1. Contractionary Monetary Policy or Dear Money Policy
• It is pursued to control Inflation  CRR is increased. Due to this increase
lending capacity of the banks decrease  SLR is also increased  Bank
rate is increased. This leads to RBI charging higher rate of interest on bank
lending due to which banks borrow less from RBI.  Repo Rate is
increased  Reverse Repo Rate is also increased. This leads to, RBI paying
more interest on Banks deposits. Thus Banks prefer to deposit extra
money with RBI instead of giving loans to public.  It is called Dear
Money Policy as loans get expensive for the public
Bank Rate and Repo Rate
• Difference between Bank Rate and Repo Rate
 Bank rate is that interest rate at which banks borrow from RBI
against First Class Securities, Securities of private companies and
re-discounting.
 Repo Rate is that rate at which Banks borrow from RBI against
Government Securities
Types of Monetary System
2. Expansionary Monetary Policy or Cheap Money Supply
• This policy is adopted to increase money supply in the economy in
order to stimulate economic growth.
• It is also pursued to overcome recession.
• CRR, SLR, Repo Rate, Re Repo Rate, Bank Rate should be reduced.
• It is called Cheap Money policy as interest rates are low thus
borrowing money becomes cheap. Since 2010 RBI has adopted
Contractionary Money Policy. In 2009 to stimulate economic growth
after global recession, RBI adopted Expansionary Monetary Policy.

Secretary of State for India - Edwin Montagu
Governor General and Viceroy - Lord Chelmsford
The most notable feature of the act was ‘end of benevolent despotism’ (तानाशाही)
and introduction of responsible government in India.
 On 20 August 1917, S.o.S. Montagu made a historic declaration in the House of
Commons in British Parliament which is called “Montagu declaration”.
 In November 1917, Montague had visited India to ascertain views from all
sections of polity
 A detailed report on Constitutional Reforms in India {Mont-Ford Report} was
published on 8th July, 1918. This report became the basis of Government of India
Act 1919.
* INC held a Special Session, with Syed Hasan Imam as president , in August 1918
– to discuss the report
 Key features of this report were as follows:
1. Increasing association of Indians in every branch of administration.
2. Gradual development of self governing institutions with a view to the
progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral
part of the British empire.
3. Progress towards responsible government in successive stages
Highlights of the 1919 Act
 India to remain as an integral part of British Empire.
 Gradual decentralization of authority with loosening the supreme hold of the
central government. (suggested for a decentralized, but unitary form of
government)
 The time and manner towards goal of responsible government will be decided
by the British Parliament.
 Partial responsibility in provinces to Indians , but no change in character of the
central government.
 1. Executive:
• Dyarchy was introduced, i.e., there were two classes of administrators – Executive
councillors and ministers.
• The Governor was the executive head of the province.
• The subjects were divided into two lists – reserved and transferred.
A. Reserved list
The governor was in charge of the reserved list along with his executive councillors.
The subjects under this list were law and order, irrigation, finance, land revenue, etc.
B. Transferred list
The ELECTED members of council were in charge of subjects under the transferred
list. The subjects included were education, local government, health, excise,
industry, public works, religious endowments, etc.
• The ministers were responsible to the people who elected them through the
legislature.
• These ministers were nominated from among the elected members of the
legislative council.
• The executive councillors were not responsible to the legislature unlike the
ministers.
• The Secretary of State and the Governor-General could interfere in matters under
the reserved list but this interference was restricted for the transferred list.
 2. Legislature:
• The size of the provincial legislative assemblies was increased. Now about 70% of
the members were elected.
• There were communal and class electorates.
• Direct elections of members (but restricted franchise)
• Some women could also vote.
• Legislators enjoyed Freedom of speech
• The governor’s assent was required to pass any bill. He also had veto power and
could issue ordinances also.
 1. Executive
• The chief executive authority was the Governor-General/Viceroy.
• There were two lists for administration – central and provincial.
• Provincial list was under the provinces while the centre took care of the central
list.
• Out of the 8 members of the Viceroy’s executive council, 3 were to be Indian
members.
• The governor-general could issue ordinances.
• He could also certify bills that were rejected by the central legislature.
• He retained the power to summon and dissolve the House
 2. Legislature
• A bicameral legislature was set up with two houses
 Legislative Assembly - Lower House (forerunner of the Lok Sabha)
 Council of State - Upper House (forerunner of the Rajya Sabha)
 The nominated members
were nominated by the
governor-general from
Anglo-Indians and Indian
Christians.
 The members had a tenure
of 3 years. (could be
extended by GG)
Members of the
Legislative Assembly
 Only male members
 Tenure of 5 years.(some
seats vacant every year)
 Members of the Council of
State:
Who could vote for these elections?
Franchise was restricted
Voters should have paid land revenue of 50 Rs annually
OR
have property worth 180 Rs. rental
OR
have been paying income tax (of Rs. 2000)
Further for council of state – only titleholders, ex members of council and Uni.
senate members were eligible
All this narrowed the number of people who could vote to an abysmal number.
For Lower House – 9 lakh
For Upper House – 17 Thousand
 The legislators could ask questions and also vote a part of the budget.
 Only 25% of the budget was subject to vote.
 Rest was non-votable.
 A bill had to passed in both houses before it became a law.
 There were three measures to resolve any deadlock between both the houses –
joint committees, joint conferences and join sittings.
Governor-General
• The governor-general’s assent was required for any bill to become a law even
if both houses have passed it.
• He could also enact a bill without the legislature’s consent.
• He could prevent a bill from becoming law if he deems it as detrimental to
the peace of the country.
• He could disallow any question, adjournment motion or debate in the house.
Indian Council
 There were to be at least 8 and a maximum of 12 members in the council.
 Half of the members should have ten years of experience in public service in
India.
 Indian members in the Council INCREASED from 2 to 3
 It also created an office of the High Commissioner for India (to act as the agent
of GG of India in London)
 The salary of S.o.S for India to be paid by Govt of Britain now.
Other salient features
 This act provided for the first time, the establishment of a public service
commission in India.
 The act also provided that after 10 years, a statutory commission would be set up
to study the working of the government. This resulted in the Simon Commission
of 1927.
 The GOI act 1919 marked the end of the policy of benevolent despotism, and
thus began the genesis of the responsible government in India.
 Dyarchy introduced the concept of responsible government.
 It introduced the concept of federal structure with a unitary bias.
 There was increased participation of Indians in the administration. They held
some portfolios like labour, health, etc.
 For the first time, elections were known to the people and it created a political
consciousness among the people.
 Some Indian women also had the right to vote for the first time.
 This act extended and consolidated communal representation.
 Franchise was very limited - Only those people who had property, taxable
income & paid high land revenue were entitled to vote
 The governor-general and the governors had a lot of power to undermine the
legislatures at the centre and the provinces respectively.
 Allocation of the seats for the central legislature was not based on population
but the ‘importance’ of the province in the eyes of the British.
NOTE - The Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919 which severely restricted press and
movement of people . Despite the unanimous opposition of Indian members of
the legislative council, the bills was passed. Several Indian members resigned in
protest.
 No specific time frame was given
 The Government alone was to decide the nature and the timing of advance
towards a responsible government
 The Indians were resentful that the British would decide what was good and
what was bad for Indians

Montesque Chelmsford
Reforms
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Montesque Chelmsford Reforms
• Montague-Chelmsford Report, which formed the basis of the Government of India Act
1919, was published on 8
th July 1918.
• This act embodied the reforms recommended in the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms and
covered a ten years period from 1919 to 1929.
• Edwin Montague was appointed the Secretary of State for India in 1917 and remained in
that office till 1922. He was critical of the manner in which India was governed.
• The Montagu declaration reads as:
• “Increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual
development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realization
of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire“.
• The key phrase “ultimate self-government” was removed but, still the another key
phrase “responsible government” in this statement gave the inference for the first time
that rulers are answerable to the public.
• The declaration made the moderates happy and they said “It is Magna Carta of India”. However
extremists expressed that it fell short for legitimate expectations of India. After all, total
independence was what they wanted.
• On 20th August 1917, Montague presented the historic Montague Declaration (August
Declaration) in the British Parliament. This declaration proposed the increased participation of
Indians in the administration and the development of self-governing institutions in India.
• In 1917, Montague visited India and held talks with the various representatives of Indian polity
including Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
• He, along with the Governor-General of India Lord Chelmsford, brought out a detailed report
titled Constitutional Reforms in India, also called the Montague-Chelmsford Report. This report
was published on 8
th July 1918.
• This report became the basis for the Government of India Act 1919 (alternatively called the
Montague-Chelmsford Reforms or Montford Reforms).
• The report was rejected by most Indian leaders. Annie Besant referred to it as ‘unworthy to be
offered by England or to be accepted by India’.
Principal provisions of the GOI Act 1919
 Diarchy was introduced in the form of two classes of administrators namely, the Executive
Councillors and the Ministers.
 The governor was the executive head of the provincial government.
 The subjects were classified into two lists – reserved and transferred. The reserved list was
under the governor and the councillors and the transferred list was under the ministers.
 The reserved list consisted of subjects like finance, law and order, irrigation, etc. and the
transferred list consisted of items like education, health, public works, religious endowments,
etc.
 The ministers were nominated from the elected members of the Legislative Council. They
were responsible to the legislature whereas the councillors were not answerable to the
legislature.
 The size of the legislative assemblies was expanded with about 70% of the members being
elected.
 At the central government level, the Governor-General was the chief executive authority.
 The governor had the veto power over the council. He could also issue ordinances.
 The communal representation was extended and Sikhs, Europeans and Anglo Indians were
included. The Franchise (Right of voting) was granted to the limited number of only those who paid
certain minimum “Tax” to the government. Even some women could vote
 This report introduced the bicameral legislature with 2 houses – Legislative Assembly (forerunner of
the Lok Sabha) and the Council of State (forerunner of the Rajya Sabha).
 The viceroy’s executive council had 6 members out of which 3 were to be Indians.
 The viceroy could issue ordinances and also certify bills that were rejected by the legislature.
 Even though elections were introduced, the franchise was partial in nature, not universal. Only
certain people who were propertied or had titles or held office could vote.
 The act provided for the establishment of a public service commission for the first time.
 It also produced an office of the High Commissioner for India in London.
• The report was important in that for the first time, concrete steps were taken to include more Indians in
the administration of their own country.

Mountains
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Mountains
• Endogenic forces and exogenic forces can create a lot of landforms.
• Examples include Mountains, Plateaus, and Plains.
• Orogeny (Geology) is a process in which a section of the earth’s
crust is folded and deformed by lateral compression to form a
mountain range.
• Orogenic movements are ‘Tectonic movements’ of the earth which
involve the folding of sediments, faulting and metamorphism
Mountains
• Nearly 27% of the world’s land surface is covered
by mountains.
• It is from the mountains that up to 80% of the
planet’s fresh surface water come from.
CLASSIFICATION OF MOUNTAINS
• The mountains, on the basis of their mode of
formation, can be classified as:
• Fold mountains
• Block mountains
• Volcanic mountains/Accumulated Mountains
• Residual Mountains/ Relict Mountains
Fold Mountains
• Fold Mountains
• Mountain ranges mainly consisting of uplifted folded
sedimentary rocks are called Fold Mountains.
• They are formed due to the force of
compression arising from the endogenic or internal
forces.
• Synclines (trough) and anticlines (crest) are part of Fold
Mountains.
• They are the loftiest (tall) mountains.
• Fold mountains can be divided into two broad types on the basis of the nature of folds.
 Simple fold mountains
 Complex fold mountains
• On the basis of period of origin, fold mountains are divided into
• very old fold mountains,
• old fold mountains and
• Alpine fold mountains.
• Simple fold mountains
 Simple fold mountains with open folds in which welldeveloped systems of synclines and anticlines are
found and folds are of wavy patterns.
• Complex fold mountains
 Complex fold mountains in which the rock strata are
intensely compressed to produce a complex structure
of folds.
 In the Himalayas, recumbent folds are often found
detached from their roots and carried few hundred
kilometres away by the tectonic forces.
Fold Mountains
Very Old Fold Mountains
• They are more than 500 million years old.
• Rounded features (due to denudation).
• Low elevation.
• The Appalachians in North America and
the Ural mountains in Russia.
Old Fold Mountains
• They are also called as Thickening relict
fold mountains because of lightly
rounded features and medium
elevation.
• Top layers worn out due to erosional
activity.
• Example: Aravali Range in India.
• The Aravali Range in India are
the oldest fold mountain systems in
India.
Alpine or young fold mountains
• Examples are the Rockies,
the Andes, the Alps, the
Himalayas, etc.
• Characteristics are:
• Rugged relief,
• Imposing height (lofty),
• High Conical Peaks.
Characteristics of Fold Mountains
• Fold mountains belong to the group of youngest mountains of the
earth.
• Fold mountains extend for great lengths whereas their width is
considerably small.
• Fold mountains are found along continental margins facing oceans.
• Recurrent seismicity is a common feature in folded mountain belts .
• They also contain rich mineral resources such as tin, copper, gold.
Block Mountains
• Block Mountains are also formed by the
internal or endogenic earth movements
which cause the force of tension and
faulting.
• The down-lifting or uplifting of land in
between two parallel faults results in the
formation of Block Mountains.
• A block mountain is also called
as Horst and the rift valley formed as a
result of faulting is called Graben.
• Examples : The Great African Rift Valley
(valley floor is graben), Rift valley in
satpura and vindyas mountains, Black
Forest Mountains in Germany.
Volcanic mountains
• Volcanoes which are built up from material
ejected from fissures in the earth’s crust.
• The mountains formed by the accumulation
of volcanic materials are called as Volcanic
Mountains or Mountains of accumulation.
• Examples:
• Mount Mauna Loa in Hawaii Island,
• Mount Popa in Myanmar,
• Fuji Yama in Japan etc are some examples.
• Kilimanjaro in Africa
Residual mountains or Relict Mountains
• Weathering acts upon the earth’s crust
constantly.
• So, in some cases, some portions of an
elevated area escape from the process of
weathering due to the hardness of the
materials it is made of.
• These portions remain unweathered while
its surrounding area gets eroded constantly.
This results in the formation of Residual or
Relict Mountains.
• Examples: Hills like Nilgiri, Palkonda,
Parasnath and Rajmahal and Mountains like
the Aravalli, the Vindhya, and the Satpura
are some of the examples of Relict
Mountains in India.
Important mountain ranges

lakes in the world.
Alps
• The mountains were formed over tens of
millions of years as the African and
Eurasian tectonic plates collided.
• Extreme shortening caused by the event
resulted in marine sedimentary rocks
rising by thrusting and folding into high
mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and
the Matterhorn.

Atlee’s Declaration – February 20, 1947
 The Prime Minister of Britain, Clement Atlee declared on February 20, 1947
in the House of Commons that the British would quit India after transferring
power into the responsible hand not later than June 1948.
 The idea was that the Indians should settle their issues before that.
 He also announced the appointment of Lord Mountbatten as Viceroy in
place of Lord Wavell.
Plan Balkan/Dickie Bird Plan
 Between March and May of 1947, Mountbatten decided that the Cabinet Mission
Plan had become untenable and formulated an alternative plan.
 This plan envisaged the transfer of power to separate provinces
 Punjab and Bengal were given the option to vote for partition of their provinces.
 The various units thus formed along with the princely states would have the option
of joining India or Pakistan or remaining separate.
 The plan was quickly abandoned after Nehru reacted violently to it.
Mountbatten Plan/3 June Plan (June 1947)
 Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan appeared inevitable to
Mountbatten.
 Prime Minister Atlee announced the Partition Plan or June 3 Plan in the House of
Commons.
 The plan laid down the following provisions.
 India to be divided into India and Pakistan.
 Bengal and Punjab will be partitioned - The provincial legislative Assemblies of
Bengal and Punjab would meet in two parts separately, one representing Muslim
majority districts and another representing the Hindu Majority districts to decide
by the vote on partition.
 In case of Sind and Baluchistan, the provincial assemblies would take the
decision.
 In case of NWFP, the decision had to be taken on the base of referendum.
 A referendum was to be organized in Sylhet region of Assam which was
Muslim majority.
 There would be a separate constituent assembly for Pakistan to frame its
constitution.
 The Princely states would enjoy the liberty to join either India or Pakistan or
ever remain independent.
 August 15, 1947, was date fixed for handling over power to India and Pakistan.
 The Congress and the Muslim League ultimately approved the Mountbatten
Plan.
Indian Independence Act 1947
 British Government accorded formal approval to the Mountbatten Plan by enacting
the Indian Independence Act on 18 July 1947.
 The salient features of this Act were –
 Partition of the country into India and Pakistan would come into effect from 15
August 1947.
 British Government would transfer all powers to these two Dominions.
 A Boundary Commission would demarcate the boundaries of the provinces of the
Punjab and Bengal.
 Act provided for the transfer of power to the Constituent Assemblies of the two
Dominions to frame their respective Constitutions.
 Radcliffe Boundary Commission drew the boundary line separating India and
Pakistan.
 On 15th August 1947 India, and on the 14th August Pakistan came into existence as
two independent states.
 Lord Mountbatten was made the first Governor General of Independent India.
 Mohammad Ali Jinnah became the first Governor General of Pakistan.(Head of
state – British Monarch till 1956)

 4 lakh people died in riots
 Millions displaced
 Greatest man made cause for migration
 Humanitarian crisis
 At the time of independence, there were 562 small and big princely states in
India except Jammu and Kashmir, Junagarh and Hyderabad
 Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the first home minister, used the iron hand in this
regard.
 By August 15, 1947, all the states, with few exceptions like Jammu & Kashmir,
Hyderabad and Junagarh had signed the Instruments of Accession.
**Goa was with the Portuguese and Pondicherry with the French.

 Birkenhead’s Challenge
On the protests and rejection of Simon Commission by Indian politicians,
Lord Birkenhead , the S.o.S. for India, challenged Indians to form their own
constitution or framework for India’s political reforms , based on consensus
from all communities (Hindus,Muslims,Sikhs ,etc) and political groups
Nehru Report 1928
 To answer to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, an All Parties Conference led
by INC met in February 1928
 They appointed a subcommittee under the chairmanship of Motilal
Nehru to draft a constitution. (J.N. Nehru was the secretary)
 This was the first major attempt by Indians to draft a constitutional
framework for the country.
 The report was finalised by August 1928.
Major Recommendations of Nehru Report
 Dominion status on lines of self-governing dominions. (within a year)
 There should be federal form of government with residuary powers vested in
the centre.
 Rejection of separate electorates which had been the basis of constitutional
reforms so far.
 Linguistic provinces
 Nineteen fundamental rights including equal rights for women, right to form
unions, and universal adult suffrage.
 Full responsible government at the centre along with Autonomy to the provinces
 A bicameral legislature at the centre
 Clear cut division of power between the centre and provinces
 Full protection to cultural and religious interests of Muslims & Complete
dissociation of state from religion
Response to Nehru Report
 Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha and the Sikh communalists were unhappy
about the Nehru Report
 The younger section of the Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash
Bose were also angry over dominion status
 Instead, they demanded that the Congress adopt Purna Swaraj or complete
independence as its goal.
 With few exceptions, Muslim League leaders rejected the Nehru proposals.
 In reaction, Mohammad Ali Jinnah drafted his Fourteen Points in 1929
which became the core demands the Muslim community put forward as the
price of their participating in an independent united India.
According to Mohammad Ali Jinnah, “The Committee has adopted a
narrow minded policy to ruin the political future of the Muslims.
I regret to declare that the report is extremely ambiguous and does not
deserve to be implemented.”
The inability of Congress to concede these points must be considered a
major factor in the eventual partition of India’’
 In the All parties meeting at Calcutta in December 1928, Jinnah moved
certain amendments to the Nehru Report. But these amendments were not
accepted by Congress. So Jinnah refused to participate further in the
conference.
 A few days later, there was a Muslim All Parties conference was held in Delhi,
in which the nationalist Muslims attended and formulated a series of
demands on behalf of the Muslims of the Country.

to minority or even equality.
4. In the Central legislature Muslim representation shall not be less than
one third.
5. Representation of the communal groups shall continue to be by separate
electorates provided that it shall be open to any community at any time to
abandon its separate electorate in favour of the joint electorates.

community in that particular body oppose it being injurious to that of the
community.
9. Sind should be separated from the Bombay Presidency.
10. Reforms should be made in the NWF Province and Baluchistan.
11. Provision should be made in the Constitution giving Muslims an adequate
share along with the other Indians in all the services of the State and Local
self Governing bodies having due regard to the requirements of efficiency.
12. The Constitution should embody adequate safeguards to the protection of
the Muslim Culture, education, language, religion, personal laws, and

Khilaafat Movement (1919–22)
 Chief cause → Defeat of Turkey in the First World War, Dethroning of the
Ottoman Emperor who was the Khalifa of Islamic world & harsh terms of the
Treaty of Sevres (1920)
 Treaty terms was felt by the Muslims as a great insult to them
 Whole movement was based on the Muslim belief that the Caliph (the Sultan
of Turkey) was the religious head of the Muslims all over the world.
Prominent leaders of this movement
 Maulana Mohd.Ali and Sahukat Ali Jauhar (Jauhar Brothers )
 Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
 Mukhtar Ansari
 Saifuddin Kitchlew
 Subsequently, the Khilaafat Movement merged with the Non-Cooperation
Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920.
 Ultimately ,Mustafa Kemal Ataturk abolished the office of Sultan/Caliph .
 He overthrew the Ottoman rule to establish a pro-Western, secular republic in
independent Turkey.
Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)
 Started by Gandhiji (NOT congress) on 1st August 1920
 Aim :
1. Swaraj
2. Justice for Jalianwalla Bagh massacre
3. Supporting Khilaafat Movement
 It was approved by the INC at the Nagpur session in December, 1920.
 *(Amendment in INC constitution)
Special Features of NCM
 Movement began with Mahatma Gandhi renouncing the medals given by the
British
 Surrender of titles and honorary positions along with resignation of membership
from the local bodies

British government in India.
 It was also planned that if the above steps did not bring results, people would
refuse to pay their taxes.
 The INC also demanded Swaraj or self-government.
 The non-cooperation movement was a decisive step in the independence
movement because for the first time, the INC was ready to forego
constitutional means to achieve self-rule.
 Gandhiji had assured that Swaraj would be achieved in a year if this movement
was continued to completion.
 On 5
th Feb. 1922 , in Chauri Chaura, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, a violent mob
set fire to a police station killing 22 policemen during a clash between the police
and protesters
 Gandhiji called off the movement on 12 February, 1922 in the wake of the Chauri
Chaura incident.
 Gandhiji said people were not ready for revolt against the government
through ahimsa.
 A lot of leaders like Motilal Nehru and C R Das were against the suspension of
the movement only due to sporadic incidents of violence.
*Gandhiji jailed for 2 years after the suspension
 Swaraj was not achieved in one year as Gandhiji had told.
 However, it was truly a mass movement where Lakhs of Indians
participated in the open protest against the government through peaceful
means.
 It shook the British government who were stunned by the extent of the
movement.
 It saw participation from both Hindus and Muslims thereby showcasing
communal harmony in the country.

Atomic and
Nuclear Physics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

ATOMIC PHYSICS
• Atom is the smallest part of matter which takes part in chemical reactions.
• Atoms consists of three particles electron, proton and neutron.
• All protons and neutrons are present in central core of atom called
nucleus.
• Electrons revolve around the nucleus.
• In an atom, electrons and protons are equal in number and have equal
and opposite charge. Hence, atom is neutral.
• Properties of fundamental particles:
• Particle Discoverer Mass (kg) Charge (coulomb)
• proton Rutherford 1.672 x 10-27 +1.6 x 10-19
• Neutron J Chadwick 1.675 x 10-27 0
• electron J.J Thomson 9.108 x 10-31 -1.6 x 1019
• Proton was discovered by Goldstein and named by Rutherford
• Subatomic Particles
• Positron: Antiparticle of electron, (+1.6*10-19 Coulomb) - discovered by
Anderson
• Neutrino: has 0 mass and 0 charge - discovered by pauli.
• Photon: mass 0 and charge 0 and velocity equal to that of light.
• Cathode Rays
• Cathode rays, discovered by Sir William Crooke.
• These are travel in straight lines.
• These produce fluorescence.(emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or
other electromagnetic radiation)
• These can produce through thin foils of metal and deflected by both electric and
magnetic fields.
• These have velocity ranging 1/30th to 1/10th of the velocity of light.
• Positive or Canal Rays
• Canal rays were discovered by Goldstein.
• These ray consists of positively charged particles.
• These travel in straight line.
• These rays are deflected by electric and magnetic fields.
• These ray can produce ionization in gases.
• X-Rays
• These are discovered by Roentgen.
• These are electromagnetic waves with wavelength range 0.1A-100A.
• These travel in straight line.
• Long exposures of X-rays injurious for human body.
• X-rays shows photoelectric effect. (electromagnetic radiation is made of a series of
particles called photons. When a photon hits an electron on a metal surface, the electron
can be emitted. The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons.)
• Uses of X-Rays
• In medical science these are used in surgery for detection of fracture, diseased
organs, foreign like bullet, stone etc. They are used in treatment of cancer and in
skin disease.
• In engineering, X-rays are used in detecting faults, cracks, flaws and gas pockets in
the finished metal products and in heavy metal sheets.
• In scientific work, X-rays are used in studying crystal structure and complex
molecules.
• In custom Department X-rays are used in custom department for detection of
banned materials which are kept hidden.
•
Radioactivity
• Radioactivity is the sending out of harmful radiation or particles, caused when atomic
nuclei breakup spontaneously.
• It was discovered by Henry Becquerel, Madame Curie and Pierre Curie for which they
jointly win noble prize.
• The nucleus having protons 83 or more are unstable.
• They emit alpha, Beta and gamma (y) particles and becomes stable.
• Robert Pierre and his wife Madame Curie discovered a new radioactive element radium.
• The Ray emitted by radioactive were first recognized by Rutherford.
• The end product of all the radioactive substance is lead.
• Madame Curie and Pierre Curie has discovered a new radioactive element is Radium.
• Radioactivity is detected by G.M. Counter.
• The time in which half nuclei of the element is decayed is fossils and
plants then it is called half life of the radioactive substance.
• Average life or mean life of a radioactive element is the ratio of total life of
all the atoms and total number of atoms present initially in the sample.
• Relation between half life and average life :
• Average life = 1.44 * half life
Applications of Radioactivity
• Radioactive Carbon-14 is used to measure the age of once living
organisms, such as plant or an animal and is called Radiocarbondating.
• Uranium dating: To find out the age of older but non living things like
rocks etc.
• In Agriculture : Using the tracer technique the fertilizer consumption of
plants can be measured. A radioisotopes is mixed with fertilizer before
application. When the plants start growing , their intake of fertilizer ca be
measured with the help of GM ounter,
• Gamma rays are used for sterilising foodstuffs and controlling insects
pests.
• Nuclear Fission
• Atom Bomb is based on nuclear fission. U-235 an P-239 are used for fissionable
material.
• Nuclear fission was first demonstrated by Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.
• Chain reaction
• When uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons, fission takes place. With
fission of each uranium nucleus, 3 neutrons and large amount of energy is
released. These neutrons cause further fission causing a chain reaction.
• Types of chained reaction:
• Uncontrolled chain reaction: In each fission reaction, three more neutrons are
produced.
• These 3 neutrons may cause the fission of three other U235 nuclei producing 9
neutrons and so on.
• The number of neutron goes on increasing till the whole fissionable material is
consumed.
• The energy proceeds very quickly and a huge amount of energy is liberated in a
short time.
• Atomic Bomb: Atomic bomb is based on nuclear fission. U235 and Pu239 are used
as fissionable material.
• The bomb was first used by USA against japan in second world war in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki on 6th august 1945 and 9 august 1945 with name little man and fat
man respectively
•
• Controlled Chain Reaction:
• A fission chain reaction which proceeds slowly without any explosion and in which
the energy released can be controlled.
• In this situation only one of the neutrons produced in each fission is able to cause
further fission.
• The rate of reaction remains constant.
• Nuclear reactors: Nuclear reactor is an arrangement in which controlled nuclear
fission takes place.
• First nuclear reactor was established in Chicago University under the supervision of
Prof. Fermi.
• Nuclear Fusion
• When two or more nuclei combine together to form heavier nucleus is
called as nuclear fusion.
• For nuclear fusion, a temperature of the order of 10^8K is required.
Hydrogen bomb was made by American Scientist in 1952. This is based on
nuclear fusion. It is 1000 times more powerful than atom bomb.
• The energy released by sun and other stars is by nuclear fusion.
• Mass energy relation:
• In 1905 Einstein established a relation between mass and energy on the
basis of theory of relativity.
• According to this relation, mass can be converted into energy and vice
versa.
• E= mc2.
• Here E is energy equivalent to mass m and c is the speed of light.
Nuclear Reactors
• Nuclear reactor is an arrangement, in which controlled nuclear fission
reaction takes place.
• First nuclear reactor was established in Chicago University under the
supervision of Prof Enrico Fermi.
• Heavy water, graphite and beryllium oxide are used to slow down the fast
moving neutrons. They are called moderate.

Uses of Nuclear Reactor
• (i) To produce electrical energy from the energy released during fission.
• (ii) To produce different isotopes, this can be used medical, physical and
agriculture science.
• A nuclear reactor is a device that contains and controls sustained nuclear chain
reactions.
• In nuclear reactors, the nuclear fission is controlled by controlling the number of
neutrons released during the fission.
• The energy liberated in a controlled manner is used to produce steam, which can
run turbines and produce electricity.
Fuel
• Fuel - (uranium 235, Plutonium-239)
• The fissionable material is used in the reactor along with a small
neutron source.
• The solid fuel is made into rods and is called fuel rods.
Role of extra neutron
• These neutrons in turn can initiate fission processes, producing still more
neutrons, and so on.
• This starts a chain reaction. Slow neutrons (thermal neutrons) are much more
likely to cause fission in U92 235 than fast neutrons.
• Fast neutrons liberated in fission would escape instead of causing another fission
reaction.
• If the chain reaction is uncontrolled, it leads to explosive energy output, as in a
nuclear bomb or Atom bomb.
• Each time an atom splits, it releases large amounts of energy in the form of heat.
• Moderators -(water, heavy water (D2O) and graphite) Light nuclei called
moderators are provided along with the fissionable nuclei for slowing down fast
neutrons.
• Core - The core of the reactor is the site of nuclear fission. It contains the fuel
elements in suitably fabricated form.
• Reflector-The core is surrounded by a reflector to reduce leakage. The energy
(heat) released in fission is continuously removed by a suitable coolant.
• Coolant - (water, heavy-water, liquid sodium, helium, Liquid oxygen). The coolant
transfers heat produced during fission to a working fluid which in turn may
produce steam. The steam drives turbines and generates electricity.
• Control rods- (cadmium, Boron). The reactor can be shut down by means of rods
(made of, for example, cadmium, Boron) that have high absorption of capacity of
neutrons. cadmium and boron can absorb neutrons to form the corresponding
isotopes, which are not radioactive.
• Shield - The whole assembly is shielded with heavy steel or concrete to check
harmful radiation from coming out.
• Use of Nuclear Reactor
• To produce electrical energy from the energy during fission.
• To produce different isotopes, this can be used medical, physical and
agriculture science
• Thermal Reactor :
• The nuclear reactor in which energy is produced by he fission of U-235 by
slow moving neutrons, are called Thermal reactors.
• Breeder Reactor:
• The nuclear reactor in which energy is produced by the fission of Pu239 or
U233 are called breeder reactors.
• Pu239 is produced from U238 and U233 is produced from Th235.
Some important facts
• Breath Analyzer:
• It is a device used by police to detect and catch people driving under the influence
of alcohal.
• Infrared radiation can pass through dry air but cannot pass through water vapour
and then transmission is altered.
• CT Scan (Computed Tomography)
• It is a medical imaging method employing tomography. This technique is used to
diagnostic studies of internal bodily structures such as tumours.
• X-rays beam are used.
• MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
• It is a medical test used by doctors to diagnose and treat diseases that cannot be
accurately diagnosed by X-rays, ultrasound or CT imaging.
• In MRI, a powerful magnetic field and radio frequency pulses are used.
• TV remote control : It is an electronic device containing an IC(integrated circuit)
and few other components. If a key on a remote control is pressed, it emits infra
red signals.
• Microwave oven : microwaves are used, they are not absorbed by air, glass, paper
etc. and hence do not heat up. Therefore cooking time is reduced.
• Metallic utensils block the microwaves, therefore cannot be used in the microwave
oven.
• Radar : Radio Detection and Ranging to find aeroplanes, ships and missiles etc.
• Maser : Microwave Amplication by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (used to
detect the actual position of artificial satellites, fighter planes, unwanted missiles
etc.
• In Ocean water, masers are utilized to communicated some important messages.

Oceanography
[Ocean Relief Features]
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Ocean Floor Division
Continental Self
Basically the seaward extension of the continent from the
shoreline to the continental edge approx. 200 m deep
Continental shelves may be formed by submersion of part of
continent due to increase in sea level or by wave erosion or
conversely by off-shore deposition
Continental Shelf of all oceans together cover 7.5% of the total
area of the oceans.
Gradient of continental is of 1° or even less.
Continental Self
The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope, called
the shelf break.
The continental shelves are covered with variable
thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers,
glaciers etc.
Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long
time by the continental shelves, become the source of
fossil fuels [Petroleum].
Continental Self
Continental Self
In some places, where the coasts are extremely
mountainous, such as at Rocky Mountains, the
continental shelf may be entirely absent
The shelf is formed mainly due to
• submergence of a part of a continent
• relative rise in sea level
• Sedimentary deposits brought down by
rivers
The average width of continental
shelves is between 70 – 80 km.
Exception : The shelves are almost absent or very narrow
along some of the margins like the coasts of Chile, the west
coast of Sumatra, etc.
The depth of the shelves also varies. It may be as shallow as 30
m in some areas while in some areas it is as deep as 600 m.
Importance of continent shelves
Sources of Marine food
They provide the richest fishing grounds;
They are potential sites for production of petroleum and gas because Continental
shelves shallowness enables sunlight to penetrate through the water, which
encourages the growth of minute plants & other microscopic organisms such as
planktons, on which millions of fishes & polyps survive.
Polymetallic nodules (manganese nodules; concentric layers of iron and manganese
hydroxides) etc. are good sources of various mineral ores like manganese, iron copper,
gold etc..]
Continental Slope
• At the southern edge of continental self,
seaward slope immediately becomes steep &
gradient to about 1 in 20 with average depth
200 – 3000m.
• Most of the canyons & trenches are observed in
this region
 The continental slope connects the continental
shelf and the ocean basins.
 It begins where the bottom of the continental
shelf sharply drops off into a steep slope.
Continental Slope
 The gradient of the slope region varies
between 2-5°.
 The seaward edge of the continental
slope loses gradient at this depth and
gives rise to continental rise.
 The continental slope boundary
indicates the end of the continents.
Continental Rise
The continental slope gradually loses its
steepness with depth.
When the slope reaches a level of
between 0.5° and 1°, it is referred to as
the continental rise.
With increasing depth the rise becomes
virtually flat and merges with the abyssal
plain.
Abysmal Plains
Where the continental rise end, deep sea plains begin covering
2/3rd of the ocean floor
Average depth is of 3000 – 6000 m
Flattest & smoothest surfaces of the world
These plains are covered with fine-grained sediments like clay and
silt.
Oceanic Deeps or Trenches
• The trenches are relatively steep sided, narrow
basins (Depressions). These areas are the deepest
parts of the oceans.
• They are of tectonic origin and are formed during
ocean – ocean convergence and ocean continent
convergence.
• They are some 3-5 km deeper than the
surrounding ocean floor.
• The trenches lie along the fringes of the deep-sea
plain at the bases of continental slopes and along
island arcs.
• The trenches run parallel to the bordering fold
mountains or the island chains.
Oceanic Deeps or Trenches
• Occurs at the base of continental slopes &
associated with active volcanos & strong
earthquakes
• Hence, Contrary to our expectations, most of
the deepest trenches are not located in the
midst of the oceans but found close to the
continents
• Deepest trench of the world → Marina trench
(11 km) of Guam islands (Pacific Ocean)
• Hence we can see that ocean trenches are
greater in magnitude than the highest
mountains on the land
Mid-Oceanic Ridges or Submarine Ridges
A mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two
chains of mountains separated by a large
depression. [Divergent Boundary]
The mountain ranges can have peaks as high
as 2,500 m and some even reach above the
ocean’s surface.
Running for a total length of 75,000 km, these
ridges form the largest mountain systems on
earth.

Mid-Oceanic Ridges or Submarine Ridges
These ridges are either broad, like a
plateau, gently sloping or in the form of
steep-sided narrow mountains.
These oceanic ridge systems are of tectonic
origin and provide evidence in support of
the theory of Plate Tectonics.
Iceland, a part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge, is
an example.
Abyssal Hills
Abyssal Hills
• Seamount: It is a mountain with pointed
summits, rising from the seafloor that does not
reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are
volcanic in origin. These can be 3,000-4,500 m
tall.
• The Emperor seamount, an extension of the
Hawaiian Islands [Hotspot] in the Pacific Ocean, is
a good example.
• Guyots: The flat topped mountains (seamounts)
are known as guyots.
• Seamounts and guyots are very common in the
Pacific Ocean where they are estimated to
number around 10,000.
Submarine Canyons
• CANYON: a deep gorge, especially one with a river flowing through
it
• GORGE: a steep, narrow valley or ravine
• VALLEY: a low area between hills or mountains or a depression,
typically with a river or stream flowing through it.
Submarine Canyons
These are deep valleys, some comparable to the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado river. (US)
They are sometimes found cutting across the continental shelves
and slopes, often extending from the mouths of large rivers.
The Hudson Canyon is the best known canyon in the world.
Atoll
These are low islands found
in the tropical oceans
consisting of coral reefs
surrounding a central
depression.
It may be a part of the sea
(lagoon), or sometimes form
enclosing a body of fresh,
brackish, or highly saline
water.
Atoll
Significance of Study of Oceanic Relief
Ocean relief controls the motion of sea water.
The oceanic movement in the form of currents, in turn, causes
many variations in both oceans and in atmosphere.
The bottom relief of oceans also influences navigation and
fishing
Difference between Straits & Isthmus
Straits Isthmus
Narrow channel of water connecting 2
large land bodies
Opposite of strait i.e. narrow channel of
land connecting 2 large water bodies
Strait of Gibraltar →Connects Atlantic
ocean & Mediterranean sea and
separates Spain (Europe) from Morocco
(Africa)
Panama Canal crosses Isthmus of Panama,
connecting the North Atlantic & Pacific
Oceans
Palk Strait → Separates India & Srilanka Isthmus of suez connects Mediterranean
sea and Red sea.

Hydrosphere – Water and Salinity
Part-2
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Water on Earth
• 71 % of earth surface constitutes water & only 29 %
constitutes land area of earth
• 97 % of water area constitutes Oceans & Seas & 2.5 % as fresh
water
• 75 % of fresh water in glaciers & ice caps
• 7 % of fresh water as groundwater
• Fresh Water comes from Glaciers > Ground water > Ice &
Snow > Lakes > soil moisture > atmosphere > Rivers
Salinity of the Ocean
• The proportion of dissolved salts to pure water is called Salinity
• Average salinity of sea water is 35 gm in 1 kg of water or 35% with
order of salts is as Nacl > Mgcl2 > MgSO4 > CaSO4 > KSO4 etc.
 sodium chloride — 77.7%
 magnesium chloride—10.9%
 magnesium sulphate —.4.7%
 calcium sulphate — 3.6%
 potassium sulphate — 2.5%
Salinity of the Ocean
Chlorine is the abundant element in Ocean.
It is usually expressed as parts per thousand or ppt.
Salinity of 24.7 has been considered as the upper limit to
demarcate ‘brackish water’.
Salinity of the Ocean
• The main source of Salinity is dissolution of the rocks of oceanic
crust which contains salts
• Highest salinity is found at Tropic of cancer & Tropic of Capricorn
due to active evaporation, owing to clear skies, high temp. &
steady trade winds
• Maximum salinity (37) is observed between 20° N and 30° N and
20° W – 60° W. It gradually decreases towards the north.
Salinity of the Ocean
• From the Tropics, salinity decreases.
• Equatorial region come second although they have
high temperatures, they have high rainfall also.
• Poles have minimum salinity because of addition of
fresh water in the for of icebergs and excessive
snowfall.
Salinity of the Ocean
• Salinity increases with depth of the sea.
• Top 3 Saline Water Bodies → Van Lake, Turkey (330) > Dead
Sea, Turkey (240) > Great Salt lake, US (220)
• Most saline sea is Red Sea.
• Isohalines : lines joining places having equal degree of
salinity.
Salinity of the Ocean
• Degree of salinity in various oceans & seas is
affected mainly by
 the rate of evaporation
 amount of fresh water added by precipitation
 streams & icebergs
 degree of water mixing by currents
Indian Ocean
• The average salinity of the Indian Ocean is 35.
• The low salinity trend is observed in the Bay of
Bengal due to influx of river water by the river
Ganga.
• On the contrary, the Arabian Sea shows higher
salinity due to high evaporation and low influx
of fresh water.
Temperature of Ocean Water
• Like land masses, ocean water varies in temperature
from place to place both at the surface & at great
depths
• Since water warms up & cools down much more
slowly than the land, the annual range of
temperature in any part of the ocean is very smaller
Miscellaneous points
• Isopleth: Lines drawn on the map along the value
of a particular phenomenon is uniform.
Examples are
 Isobars: Equal Pressure
 Isobaths: Equal depth in the sea
 Isobronts: Thunderstorm at the same time
 Isohaline: Same Salinity
Thermocline
 Isohels: Same Sunshine
 Isohypes: Same elevation above sea level
 Isonif: Same Snow
 Isotherms: Same Temperature
 Isoneph: Same cloudiness
 Isocline: Same slope

Waves and Ocean Currents
Part-3
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Ocean Waves
• Oscillatory movements in water manifested by alternate rise
& fall of sea surface
• Formed mainly by friction & pressure of wind on sea surface
• There is no upward movement of water in a wave. When a
Wave enters shallow water it breaks.
Ocean Waves
• Water from the breaking wave runs up the shore as swash
and back down the shores as backwash.
• The maximum height of the wave in most oceans is about
12m but they may be as high as 15m.
• Seismic waves or tsunamis are the waves caused by
earthquakes in volcanic eruptions in the sea bottom.
Ocean Currents
• Ocean currents are the large masses of surface water that
circulates in regular pattern around the oceans
• Only water in current moves forward while water on its sides
& below remains almost stationary
• Those that flow from equatorial region polewards have a
higher surface temperature & are warm currents
• Those that flow from Polar Regions equator ward have a
lower surface temperature & are cold currents

Major factors
• Prevailing winds, salinity differences of water, Density, Temp.
difference, Evaporation, Rotation & revolution of earth, Shape
of coasts, coriolis force, gravitational force
• Prevailing winds are the major factors as they blow
consistently in one direction & drag the surface water due to
force of friction
• Prevailing winds are Trade winds, Westerlies and Polar
Easterlies
Major factors
• There is much difference in the temp. of ocean water at
the equator & at the poles
• As warm water is lighter & rises, and cold water is denser
& sinks; warm equatorial water move slowly along the
surface pole-wards, while the heavier cold water of polar
regions creeps slowly along the bottom of the sea
equator-wards
Major factors
• Waters of high salinity is denser than the waters of low
salinity, hence the waters of low salinity flow on the surface of
water of high salinity and vice versa.
• Currents circulate in clockwise direction in Northern
Hemisphere and in anti-clockwise direction in Southern
Hemisphere.
Circulation of Pacific Ocean
• Deepest ,Largest, Triangular in
shape + 1/3
rd of Earth’s area
• The NE trade winds blow the
North equatorial current off the
coast of the Philippines &
Formosa into the East China Sea
as the Kuroshio or Japan
current.
• It moves poleward as North
Pacific drift, keeping the ports
of Alaskan coast ice free in
winters.
Circulation of Pacific Ocean
• The cold Bering current or Alaskan
current creeps southwards from the
narrow Bering strait & is joined by
Okhotsk current, to meet the warm
Japan current as cold Oyashio current.
• The cold water eventually sinks below
the warm water of North Pacific drift
& part of Oyashio moves eastward as
the cold Californian current along the
coast of western USA, which finally
coalesces with the North Equatorial
current to complete the clockwise
circulation.

Circulation of Pacific Ocean
• The South equatorial current,
driven by the SE trade winds,
flows southward along the
coast of Queensland as the
East Australian current.
• The current turns eastward
towards New Zealand under
the full effect of westerlies in
the Tasman Sea & merges
with south pacific current.
Circulation of Pacific Ocean
• Obstructed by the tip of
southern Chile, the
current turns northward
along the western coast
of South America as the
cold Humboldt Current or
Peruvian current.
• The Peruvian current
eventually links up with
the South Equatorial
current & completes the
cycle of currents in South
Pacific.
Phytoplankton and Fishing
• Mixing zones of Cold and Warm Ocean Currents
[Grand Banks] and cold water upwelling zones [Peru
coast] are the most productive fishing grounds on
earth.
• Phytoplankton are the primary producers in the
marine food chain and hence they are called the ‘grass
of the sea’.
• Phytoplankton are predominantly microscopic, single
celled organisms.
Circulation of Atlantic Ocean
• 1/6
th of the earth area
• The steady trade winds
constantly drift two streams
of water from east to west
as North equatorial current
& South equatorial current
• Between the west flowing
North & South Equatorial
currents is the east flowing
Equatorial counter current
North Atlantic Ocean Current Movement
• In the North Atlantic Ocean, the
Canaries current is joined &
reinforced by North equatorial current
• Heads north-westward as a large mass
of equatorial water into the Caribbean
Sea
• Part of the current enters the Gulf of
Mexico & emerges from the Florida
straight between Florida & Cuba as
Florida current
• The rest of the equatorial water flows
northwards, east of Antilles to join the
Gulf Stream off the SE USA
North Atlantic Ocean Current Movement
• Gulf Stream hugs the coast of America
as far as Cape Hartteras, where it get
deflected eastwards under the
combined effect of westerlies &
rotation of the earth; and reaches
Europe as North Atlantic drift
• From the North Atlantic, it fans out in
three directions viz. eastward to
Britain, northward to Arctic &
southward along the Iberian coast as
the cool Canaries current
North Atlantic Ocean Current Movement
• The canaries current flowing
southward eventually merges
with North equatorial current,
completing the clockwise
circuit in the North Atlantic
ocean
• Within this ring of currents, an
area in the middle of Atlantic
has no perceptible current
• A large amount of floating
seaweed gathers in here & the
area is called Sargasso Sea
North Atlantic Ocean Current Movement
• Apart from the clockwise circulation of
currents, there are also cold currents
that enter the North Atlantic from the
Arctic regions, which are blown south
by out-flowing polar winds.
• The East Greenland current flows
between Iceland & Greenland & cools
the North Atlantic drift at the point of
convergence
• The cold Labrador current drifts southeastwards between west Greenland &
Baffin island to meet the warm Gulf
stream off Newfoundland
Sargasso Sea
• The Sargasso Sea is a region in the gyre in the
middle of the North Atlantic Ocean.
• It is the only sea on Earth which has no coastline.
• It is bounded on the
• west by the Gulf Stream;
• north, by the North Atlantic Current;
• east, by the Canary Current; and
• south, by the North Atlantic Equatorial Current.
• This system of ocean currents forms the North
Atlantic Gyre.
• All the currents deposit the marine plants and
refuse they carry into this sea.
South Atlantic Ocean Current Movement
• At the shoulder of NE Brazil, the protruding
land mass splits the South equatorial current
into Guinea current which flows along the
Guiana coast and Brazilian current which
flows southwards along the coast of Brazil
• The South Atlantic Ocean follows the same
pattern but the major differences are the
circuit is anti-clockwise here & collection of
seaweed in mid-south Atlantic is not so
distinctive
• Where the South equatorial current is split (at
Cape Sao Roque), one branch turns south as
the warm Brazilian current
South Atlantic Ocean Current Movement
• At about 40*S, the influence of westerlies &
rotation of the earth, propels the current
eastward to merge with the cold South
Atlantic current
• On reaching the west coast of Africa, the
current is diverted northward as the cold
Benguela current
• Driven by the regular SE trade winds, the
Benguela current surges equatorwards to
join South equatorial current
• This completes the circulation of the
currents in South Atlantic
Indian Ocean Circulation
• The equatorial current, turning
southward past Madagascar as the
Agulhas or Mozambique current
merges with the South Pacific current
• Flowing eastward, it turns equatorward
as cold West Australian current
• In north Indian Ocean, there is
complete reversion of direction of
currents between summers & winters,
due to change of monsoon winds
Indian Ocean Circulation
• In summers, under the effect of SW
monsoon, it flows clockwise, & in winters
under the effect of NE monsoon, it flows
anti-clockwise
• Heating by solar rays’ causes expansion
of water that is why near the equator
ocean water is 8 cm higher in level
compared to mid latitudes

Coral Reefs
Part-4
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Coral Reefs
• In tropical seas, various kinds of coral animals
& marine organisms such as coral polyps,
calcareous algae, shell forming creatures &
lime secreting plants live in large colonies
• Though they are tiny creatures, their ability to
secrete calcium carbonate within their tiny
cells has given rise to a peculiar type of
marine landform
Coral Reefs
• Coral reefs are generally made of tiny animals
called “polyps” that stay fixed in one place
and are the main structure of a reef
• Polyps have a hard outer skeleton made of
calcium (similar to a snail’s shell)
• When they die, their limy skeletons are
cemented into coralline limestone
Coral Reefs
• The reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and moving
water
• However, they grow very slowly—anywhere from 0.3 cm to 10 cm
per year
Favorable conditions for Coral Reefs
• Found mainly in warmer tropical seas, with water temp. not
falling below 20*C approx. & does not flourish in cold
currents.
• Depth of the water should not exceed 180 feet or 30
fathom, because beyond this range sunlight is too faint for
photosynthesis to take place.
• Muddy or very saline water is injurious for their growth.
Favorable conditions for Coral Reefs
• Water should be saltish & free from sediments. Corals, thus, survive
best in moving ocean waters well away from the silty coasts & best
developed on the seaward sides of the reef.
• Coral reefs over a period of time transform or evolve into coral
islands (Lakshadweep).
• The corals occur in different forms and colours, depending upon
the nature of salts or constituents they are made of.
• Small marine plants (algae) also deposit calcium carbonate
contributing to coral growth.
Types of Coral Reefs
1. Fringing Reefs
2. Barrier Reefs
3. Atolls
Fringing Reefs (Shore Reefs)
• The most common type of reef is the
fringing reef.
• This type of reef grows seaward directly
from the shore.
• They form borders along the shoreline/
along the continental margins and
surrounding islands & may be separated
from the shore by narrow, shallow
lagoons.
Fringing Reefs (Shore Reefs)
The seaward slope is steep and vertical while the landward slope is gentle.
Sometimes there is a lagoon or shallow channel between the fringing reef and the land. Such
reefs are found near Rameshwaram in Gulf of Mannar.
Fringing Reefs (Shore Reefs)
• The fringing reef is by far the most
common of the three major types of coral
reefs, with numerous examples in all
major regions of coral reef development.
• A lagoon – refers to a comparatively wide
band of water that lies between the shore
and the main area of reef development,
and contains at least some deep portions.
• Most common reef in the Great
Caribbean and Red Sea
Fringing and Barrier Reefs
Barrier Reef
• They are the largest, most
extensive, highest and widest
reefs of all.
• Barrier reefs are similar to
fringing reefs as they also
border a shoreline & are
parallel the coastline but are
separated by much deeper &
wider lagoons.
Barrier Reef
• Barrier reef may be partially submerged
& where it lies above the water level,
sand can get accumulated & little
vegetation is possible.
• Barrier reefs have narrow gaps at
several places to allow water from the
enclosed lagoon to return to the open
surface.
• Such gaps are also useful for ships to
enter or leave the lagoon.
Barrier Reef
• It extends as a broken, irregular ring
around the coast or an island, running
almost parallel to it.
• Barrier reefs are far less common than
fringing reefs or atolls, although
examples can be found in the tropical
Atlantic as well as the Pacific.
• The 1200-mile long Great Barrier
Reef off the NE coast of Australia is the
world’s largest example of this reef
type.
Atolls
• When a fringing reef continues
to grow upward from a volcanic
island that has sunk entirely
below sea level, an atoll is
formed.
• Atolls are usually circular or
oval in shape, with an open
lagoon in the center.
Atolls
• A reef of narrow growing corals of
horse shoe shape and crowned with
palm trees is called an atoll.
• It is formed around an island or in
elliptical form on a submarine
platform.
• An atoll may have any one of the
following three forms-
Atolls
1. true atoll—a circular reef
enclosing a lagoon with no
island;
2. an atoll surrounding a lagoon
with an island;
3. a coral island or an atoll
island which is, in fact, an
atoll reef, built by the process
of erosion and deposition of
waves with island crowns
formed on them.
Atolls
• Atolls are far more common in
the Pacific than any other
ocean.
• The Fiji atoll and the Funafuti
atoll in the Ellice/Island are
well known examples of atolls.
A large ‘number of atolls also
occur in the Lakshadweep
Islands.

Coral Reefs Origin Theory
• Darwin’s Theory
• all coral reefs began as fringing reefs around an Island or topmost
portions of extinct volcanoes, which stood above the ocean bed.
• Over millions of years, the volcano sinks lower into the sea and the
sea level rises around the volcano due to subsidized down-warping
• The coral grows upwards to keep from getting too far from the
sunlight at the sea surface.
• The outward side of the coral reef grows fastest since ocean
currents bring in the plankton that the corals feed on.
Darwin’s Theory
Darwin’s Theory
• Water on the landward side of the reef is still
& there is less oceanic plankton
• Hence here the reef was unable to grow fast
enough to keep up with the rising sea level &
eventually drowned.
• A lagoon develops between the reef and the
land, resulting in the characteristic barrier
reef shape.
• Eventually, when the volcano land completely
submerged, only the outer rim of the reefs
was seen, forming an atoll.
• Thus, the atoll marks position of former
islands & lagoons it contains are generally
shallow.
Darwin’s Theory
Daly’s Glacial Control theory
• Daly noticed the close relationship between glaciation & development
of coral reefs.
• According to him, Pleistocene glaciation caused the subsidence of sea
level.
Daly’s Glacial Control theory
• Narrow platform supported fringing reefs; broad
platforms supported barrier reefs while isolated
platforms supported formation of Atolls.
Ideal Conditions for Coral Growth
• Stable climatic conditions: Corals are highly susceptible to
quick changes. They grow in regions where climate is
significantly stable for a long period of time.
• Perpetually warm waters: Corals thrive in tropical
waters [30°N and 30°S latitudes, The temperature of water
is around 20°C] where diurnal and annual temperature
ranges are very narrow.
Ideal Conditions for Coral Growth
• Shallow water: Coral require fairly good amount
of sunlight to survive. The ideal depths for coral
growth are 45 m to 55 m below sea surface, where
there is abundant sunlight available.
• Clear salt water: Clear salt water is suitable for coral
growth, while both fresh water and highly saline
water are harmful.
Ideal Conditions for Coral Growth
• Abundant Plankton: Adequate supply of oxygen and
microscopic marine food, called plankton
[phytoplankton], is essential for growth. As the plankton
is more abundant on the seaward side, corals grow
rapidly on the seaward side.
• Little or no pollution: Corals are highly fragile and are
vulnerable to climate change and pollution and even a
minute increase in marine pollution can be catastrophic.
Distribution of Coral Reefs
Corals and Zooxanthellae
• Many invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants live in close association
with corals, with tight resource coupling and recycling, allowing
coral reefs to have extremely high productivity and biodiversity,
such that they are referred to as ‘the Tropical Rainforests of the
Oceans’.
• Scleractinian corals build skeletons of calcium carbonate
sequestered from the water.
Corals and Zooxanthellae
• Scleractinian corals come under Phylum
Cnidaria, and they receive their nutrient and
energy resources in two ways.
1. They use the traditional cnidarian strategy of
capturing tiny planktonic organisms with their
tentacles
2. Having a symbiotic relationship with a single
cell algae known as ZOOXANTHELLAE.
Corals and Zooxanthellae
• Zooxanthellae are autorophic
[prepare their own food]
microalgaes belonging to various
taxa in the Phylum Dinoflagellata.
• Coral = Phylum Cnidaria.
• Zooxanthellae = Phylum
Dinoflagellata.
Symbiotic Relationship Between
Corals And Zooxanthellae
• Zooxanthellae live symbiotically within
the coral polyp tissues and assist the
coral in nutrient production through
its photosynthetic activities.
• The host coral polyp in return provides
its zooxanthellae with a protected
environment to live within, and
a steady supply of carbon dioxide for
its photosynthetic processes.
Symbiotic Relationship Between
Corals And Zooxanthellae
• The corals can feed by day
through photosynthesis and by
night through predation.
The tissues of corals themselves are
actually not the beautiful colors of
the coral reef, but are instead clear.
The corals receive their coloration
from the ZOOXANTHELLAE living
within their tissues.
Coral Bleaching or Coral Reef Bleaching
Coral Bleaching or Coral Reef Bleaching
• Disturbances affecting coral
reefs include anthropogenic
and natural events.
• Recent accelerated coral reef
decline is related mostly to
anthropogenic
impacts (overexploitation,
overfishing, increased
sedimentation and nutrient
overloading).
Coral Bleaching or Coral Reef Bleaching
• Natural disturbances which cause damage to coral reefs
include violent storms, flooding, high and low temperature
extremes, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, sub
aerial exposures, predatory outbreaks and epizootics.
• Coral reef bleaching is a common stress response of corals to
many of the various disturbances mentioned above.
Coral Bleaching or Coral Reef Bleaching
• Bleaching occurs when
1. the densities of zooxanthellae decline and/or
2. the concentration of photosynthetic pigments within the
zooxanthellae fall. [it is no more useful for the coral and the coral
will bleach it]
• When corals bleach they commonly lose 60-90% of their
zooxanthellae and each zooxanthellae may lose 50-80% of its
photosynthetic pigments.
Coral Bleaching or Coral Reef Bleaching
• If the stress-causing bleaching is not too severe and if it
decreases in time, the affected corals usually regain their
symbiotic algae within several weeks or a few months.
• If zooxanthellae loss is prolonged, i.e. if the stress continues
and depleted zooxanthellae populations do not recover, the
coral host eventually dies
Ecological Causes of Coral Bleaching
• Temperature
 Coral species live within a relatively narrow temperature margin,
and anomalously low and high sea temperatures [corals are
absent on the west coast of tropical temperate continents
because of the cold currents] can induce coral bleaching.
 Bleaching events occur during sudden temperature drops
accompanying intense upwelling episodes [El-Nino], seasonal
cold-air outbreaks.
Temperature
• Most reefs recovered, with low levels of coral deaths, but
damage has been severe at places.
• This is an instance of coral reefs’ susceptibility to increased
water temperatures combined with OCEAN ACIDIFICATION.
• While the rising temperatures have increased the
frequency and intensity of bleaching, acidification
has reduced corals calcifying ability.
Temperature
• Small temperature increase over many weeks or large increase
(3-4 °C) over a few days will result in coral dysfunction.
• Coral bleaching has occurred mostly during the summer seasons
or near the end of a protracted warming period.
• They are reported to have taken place during times of low wind
velocity, clear skies, calm seas and low turbidity.The conditions
favor localised heating and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
Temperature
• UV radiation readily penetrates clear sea waters. The corals
actually contain UV-absorbing compounds which can block
potentially damaging UV radiation. But rising temperatures
mean reduction in the concentration of these UV absorbing
compounds in corals.
Sub aerial Exposure
• Sudden exposure of reef flat corals to the atmosphere
during events such as extreme low tides, ENSO-related sea
level drops or tectonic uplift can potentially induce
bleaching.
• The consequent exposure to high or low temperatures,
increased solar radiation, desiccation, and sea water
dilution by heavy rains could all play a role in zooxanthellae
loss, but could also very well lead to coral death.
Fresh Water Dilution
• Rapid dilution of reef waters from storm-generated
precipitation and runoff has been demonstrated to
cause coral reef bleaching.
• Generally, such bleaching events are rare and
confined to relatively small, near shore areas.
Inorganic Nutrients
• Rather than causing coral reef bleaching, an increase in
ambient elemental nutrient concentrations (e.g. ammonia
and nitrate) actually increases zooxanthellae densities 2-3
times.
• Although eutrophication is not directly involved in
zooxanthellae loss, it could cause secondary adverse effects
such as lowering of coral resistance and greater susceptibility
to diseases.
Xenobiotics
• When corals are exposed to high concentrations of
chemical contaminants like copper, herbicides and
oil, coral bleaching happens.
Consequences of global coral bleaching
• Coral reef ecosystems are less than 0.1% of the ocean area
but provide food and shelter to 25% of all marine species.
• They support fish stocks on which some 500 million people
are dependent globally.
Mass bleaching can turn a coral dominated reef to an algae
dominated one in the space of a few months — a process that
can take decades or longer to reverse.

Bays, Straits, Isthmus and
Lakes of the world
Part-6
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Bays, Gulfs, Straits, Lakes
Bays, gulfs, and straits are types of water bodies that are
contained within a larger body of water near land.
Bays
A bay is a small body of water that is set off from a larger
body of water generally where the land curves inward.
Or a Bay is a water body surrounded on three sides by
land with the fourth side (mouth) wide open towards
oceans.
Examples of Bay
The Bay of Pigs (Cuba),
and Guantánamo Bay
Hudson Bay (Canada),
Bay of Bengal (Indian
Ocean)
Gulfs
• A gulf is a large body of water,
sometimes with a narrow mouth,
that is almost completely
surrounded by land (Bay with a
wide mouth)
• The world’s largest gulf is the Gulf
of Mexico.
Gulfs
Gulf of California Gulf of Aden (between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea)
Gulfs
Persian Gulf (between Saudi Arabia and Iran) Arabian Gulf
Gulfs
Gulf of St. Lawrence English channel separates Southern
England from northern France
Straits
• A strait is a narrow passageway of water, usually
between continents or islands, or between two
larger bodies of water.
Strait of Gibraltar
• The Strait of Gibraltar is
probably the world’s most
famous strait. It connects the
Atlantic Ocean on its west
with the Mediterranean Sea
on its east.
Strait of Bosporus
• Strait of Bosporus connects
the Black Sea (from the
north) and the Sea of
Marmara (from the south),
and splits northwestern
Turkey.

Choke Point
• When a body of water such as a
strait is capable of being blocked
or even closed in order to control
transportation routes, the body is
called a “choke point.”
• Historically, the Strait of Gibraltar
has been one of the world’s most
important choke points.
Choke Point
• The Strait of Hormuz has
become an important choke
point in recent years because
of increasing Middle East
tensions.

United Arab Emirates and
Oman (on one side) and Iran
(on the other side).
Isthmus
• Isthmus is a narrow strip of land
connecting two larger land masses.
• Example: Isthmus of Panama (the
Isthmus of Darien, is the narrow strip
of land that lies between the
Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean,
linking North and South America.)
Isthmus
• Isthmus of Suez (lies
between the Mediterranean
Sea and the Red Sea, and is

Oceanography
Ocean currents: Forces
Responsible For Ocean Currents
Part-7
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Ocean Movements
• The movements that occur in oceans are categorized
as: waves, tides and currents.
• Waves are formed due to friction between wind and
surface water layer.
• The stronger the wind, the bigger the wave.
Ocean Movements
• Horizontal currents arise mainly due to friction between
wind and water.
• Rotation of earth, Coriolis force and differences in water
level gradient also play a major role.
• Vertical currents arise mainly due to density differences
caused by temperature and salinity changes.
• Tsunami, storm surge and tides are tidal waves.
Ocean currents
• Ocean currents represent a regular volume of water in
a definite path and direction.
• Ocean currents are influenced by two types of forces namely:
1. primary forces
2. secondary forces
Ocean currents
• The primary forces that initiate the movement of water;
1. heating by solar energy;
2. wind;
3. gravity;
4. Coriolis force.
• The secondary forces that influence the currents to flow are:
1. Temperature difference;
2. Salinity difference
Primary Forces Responsible For Ocean Currents
• Influence of solar heat
 Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That
is why, near the equator the ocean water is higher in level
Influence of wind (atmospheric circulation)
• Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water
to move.
• Winds are responsible for both magnitude and direction.
Example: Monsoon winds are responsible for the seasonal
reversal of ocean currents in the Indian ocean.
Influence of wind (atmospheric circulation)
• The oceanic circulation pattern roughly
corresponds to the earth’s atmospheric
circulation pattern.
• The air circulation over the oceans in the
middle latitudes is mainly anticyclonic [Subtropical High Pressure Belt]
• At higher latitudes, where the wind flow is
mostly cyclonic [Sub-polar Low Pressure
Belt], the oceanic circulation follows this
pattern.
Influence of gravity
 Gravity tends to pull the water down to pile and
create gradient variation.
Influence of Coriolis force
• The Coriolis force intervenes and causes
the water to move to the right in the
northern hemisphere and to the left in
the southern hemisphere.
• These large accumulations of water and
the flow around them are called Gyres.
• Example : Sargasso Sea.
Secondary Forces Responsible For Ocean Currents
Temperature difference and salinity difference are the secondary forces.
Water with high salinity is denser than water with low salinity and in the same way
cold water is denser than warm water.
Denser water tends to sink, while relatively lighter water tends to rise.
Cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at the poles sinks and slowly
moves towards the equator.
Warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the surface, flowing towards
the poles to replace the sinking cold water.
Effects of Ocean Currents
• Ocean currents have a number of
direct and indirect influences on
human activities.
• Desert formation
 Cold ocean currents have a direct
effect on desert formation in west
coast regions of the tropical and
subtropical continents.
 There is fog and most of the areas
are arid due to loss of moisture.
Desert Formation and Ocean Currents
Major hot deserts are located between 20-30
degree latitudes and on the western side of
the continents.
Desert Formation and Ocean Currents
• The aridity of the hot deserts is mainly due to
the effects of off-shore Trade Winds, hence
they are also called Trade Wind Deserts.
Desert Formation and Ocean Currents
Desert Formation and Ocean Currents
• The hot deserts lie along the Horse
Latitudes or the Sub-Tropical High
Pressure Belts where the air is
descending, a condition least
favorable for precipitation of any
kind to take place.
Effects of Ocean Currents
• Rains
 Warm ocean currents bring rain to coastal areas
and even interiors. Example: Summer Rainfall
in British Type climate.
Effects of Ocean Currents
• Fishing
 Mixing of cold and warm ocean currents
bear richest fishing grounds in the world.
 It also creates some foggy conditions
 Example: Grand Banks around
Newfoundland, Canada and North-Eastern
Coast of Japan.
 Titantic Tragedy : Meeting of Cold
Labrador Current and Gulf Stream
• The mixing of warm and cold currents help to
replenish the oxygen and favor the growth
of planktons, the primary food for fish population.
The best fishing grounds of the world exist mainly in
these mixing zones.
Effects of Ocean Currents
• Tropical cyclones
 They pile up warm
waters in tropics and
this warm water is the
major force behind
tropical cyclones.
Effects of Ocean Currents
 Ships usually follow routes which are aided by
ocean currents and winds.
Some Facts about Oceans
• The Pacific Ocean
 Largest and deepest ocean.
 Covers about one-third of
the earth’s surface.
 Average depth is generally
around 7,300 metres.
 Its shape is
roughly triangular with its
apex in the north at
the Bering Strait.
Some Facts about Oceans
 Characterized by maximum depth and a
large number of deeps, trenches and
islands.
 Some well-known trenches
are Aleutian and Kuril. (North and
central)
 Mariana Trench and Mindanao
Trench are very deep with a depth of
more than 10,000 meters. (west and
south west )
 The Tonga and Atacama trenches are
prominent. (South east)
Some Facts about Oceans
• The Atlantic Ocean
 The Atlantic is the second
largest ocean after the Pacific.
 It is roughly half the size of the
Pacific Ocean.
 It’s shape resembles the letter
‘S’. In terms of trade, it is the
most significant of all oceans.
Some Facts about Oceans
• The Indian Ocean
 Indian Ocean is the third largest of
the world’s oceanic divisions.
 Smaller and less deep than the
Atlantic Ocean.
 Sunda Trench, which lies to the
south of the island of Java
and Diamantina Trench, west of
Australia.

Seas of the World
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Marginal Seas
• In oceanography, a marginal sea is a sea partially
enclosed by islands, archipelagos, or peninsulas.
• Some of the major marginal seas include the Arabian
Sea, Baltic Sea, Bay of Bengal, Bering Sea, Black Sea,
Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea,
Red Sea, and all four of the Siberian Seas (Barents,
Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian).
Marginal Seas
• The primary differences between marginal seas
and open oceans are associated with depth and
proximity to landmasses.
• Marginal seas, which are generally shallower than
open oceans, are more influenced by human
activities, river runoff, climate, and water
circulation.

conflict zone)
• Tasman Sea (between Australia and
New Zealand)
• Yellow Sea (by the Korean Peninsula)
Marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean
Seas in the Southern Ocean
Human Impact on marginal seas
• Marginal seas are more susceptible to pollution than open
ocean regions because of the high concentration of human
activities near coastlines and rivers.
• The greatest human impact on marginal seas is related to
the fisheries industry.
• Ninety percent of the world’s fisheries exist within coastal
waters that are located less than 200 kilometers (124 miles)
from the shoreline.
Human Impact on marginal seas
• Other human activities i.e.
• Industrial sewage disposal,
• Offshore oil drilling,
• Accidental releases of pollutants, including petroleum
products, radioactive waste, detergents, and plastics.
Phytoplankton Bloom (Algal Bloom)
in Marginal Seas
• The Mediterranean Sea and the
Black Sea are marginal seas
found in proximity to one
another.
• The color difference shown
here is due to a phytoplankton
bloom occurring in the Black
Sea.
Phytoplankton Bloom (Algal Bloom)
in Marginal Seas
• Phytoplankton are good as fish feed on them. But when they
proliferate indiscriminately, they consume too much oxygen
during nights, thus depriving other marine organisms of
oxygen.
• For example, the discharge of domestic sewage leads to
elevated nutrient concentrations (particularly phosphates)
which can result in harmful algal blooms.
Biomass Production and
Primary Productivity
• Marine biomass production originates with primary
productivity, which in turn is affected by the availability of
sunlight, carbon dioxide, nutrients such as nitrates and
phosphates, and trace elements.
• Marginal seas generally exhibit intermediate levels of primary
production, with the highest rates found in coastal upwelling
regions and the lowest primary production occurring in open
ocean regions.
Biomass Production and
Primary Productivity
• Hence, the highest biomass production rates occur in coastal
upwelling zones, the lowest in open oceans regions,
and intermediate rates in marginal seas.
• For near shore regions, the dominant processes influencing
primary productivity are river runoff, water column mixing,
and turbidity.
• River runoff and water column mixing introduce dissolved
nutrients, trace elements, and suspended particles into the
photic (light) zones of near shore regions.
Biomass Production and
Primary Productivity
• Although the addition of dissolved nutrients and trace
elements to coastal waters and marginal seas serves to
increase primary production, the addition of suspended
particles increases water turbidity, which results in reduced
sunlight penetration and decreased primary productivity.

Pallavas
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Origin of Pallavas
• There are no records about Pallavas in the vernacular legends.
• They were forgotten until a copper plate grant was found in 1840.
• There are several theories of origin around Pallavas.
• As per one theory, Pallavas were earlier feudatories of Satavahanas.
• Another theory says that they were offsprings of Chola and Naga
rulers of Ilam (Sri Lanka).
Origin of Pallavas
• The first Pallava kings ruled during the beginning of the 4th century AD.
• By the 7th century AD, there were three kingdoms in southern India vying
for supremacy namely the Chalukyas of Badami, the Pandyas of Madurai
and the Pallavas of Kanchipuram.
Extent
• The Pallava capital was Kanchipuram.
• Their territories at the height of their powers
extended from northern part of Andhra
Pradesh to River Kaveri in the South.
• During the seventh century, the Cholas were
reduced to a marginal state by the authority
of the Pallavas.
• Vatapi (Badami) was occupied by the Pallava
king Narasimhavarman who defeated the
Chalukyas.

Parliament 3 ( Types
of Bill )
By – Dr.Vipan Goyal

Legislative Procedure in Parliament
• The legislative procedure is identical in both the Houses of Parliament.
• Every bill has to pass through the same stages in each House.
• A bill is a proposal for legislation and it becomes an act or law when duly
enacted.
©StudyIQ Education
The bills introduced in the Parliament can also be classified into four categories:
1. Ordinary bills, which are concerned with any matter other than financial subjects.
2. Money bills, which are concerned with the financial matters like taxation, public
expenditure,etc
3. Financial bills, which are also concerned with financial matters (but are different
from money bills).
4. Constitution amendment bills, which are concerned with the amendment of the
provisions of the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Money Bills
Article 110 of the Constitution deals with the definition of money bills.
It states that a bill is deemed to be a money bill if it contains only provisions
dealing with any of the following matters:
• The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax;
• The regulation of the borrowing of money by the Union government;
• The custody of the Consolidated Fund of India or the contingency fund of
India, the payment or withdrawal of money from them
• Declaration of any expenditure as ‘charged’ on the Consolidated Fund of
India
• The receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of India or the
public account of India or the custody or issue of such money, or the audit of
the accounts of the Union or of a state
©StudyIQ Education
• If any question arises whether a bill is a money bill or not, the decision of the
Speaker of the Lok Sabha is final. His decision in this regard cannot be
questioned in any court of law or in the either House of Parliament or even
the president.
• When a money bill is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for recommendation and
presented to the president for assent, the Speaker endorses it as a money bill.
• A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and that too on the
recommendation of the president.
• Every such bill is considered to be a government bill and can be introduced
only by a minister.
©StudyIQ Education
• The Rajya Sabha cannot reject or amend a money bill.
• It can only make recommendations.
• It must return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, with or without
recommendations.
• The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject all or any of the recommendations
of the Rajya Sabha.
• If the Rajya Sabha does not return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days,
the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form
originally passed by the Lok Sabha.
• Thus, the Lok Sabha has more powers than Rajya Sabha with regard to a
money bill.
• On the other hand, both the Houses have equal powers with regard to an
ordinary bill.
©StudyIQ Education
• Finally, when a money bill is presented to the president, he may either give
his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill but cannot return the
bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
• Normally, the president gives his assent to a money bill as it is introduced in
the Parliament with his prior permission.
©StudyIQ Education
Financial Bills - Art.117
• Financial bills are those bills that deal with fiscal matters, that is, revenue or
expenditure.
• However, the Constitution uses the term financial bill in a technical sense.
Financial bills are of three kinds:
 Money bills—Article 110
 Financial bills (I)—Article 117 (1)
 Financial bills (II)—Article 117 (3)
** Money bills are simply a species of financial bills.
 Hence, all money bills are financial bills but all financial bills are not money
bills.
©StudyIQ Education
• Only those financial bills are money bills which contain exclusively those
matters which are mentioned in Article 110 of the Constitution.
• These are also certified by the Speaker of Lok Sabha as money bills.
• The financial bills (I) and (II), on the other hand, have been dealt with in
Article 117 of the Constitution.
©StudyIQ Education
Financial Bills (I) - Article 117 (1)
• contains not only any or all the matters mentioned in Article 110, but also
other matters of general legislation.
• a bill that contains a borrowing clause, but does not exclusively deal with
borrowing.
• In two respects, a financial bill (I) is similar to a money bill :
(a) both of them can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya
Sabha, and
(b) both of them can be introduced only on the recommendation of the
president.
©StudyIQ Education
• In all other respects, a financial bill (I) is governed by the same legislative
procedure applicable to an ordinary bill.
• Hence, it can be either rejected or amended by the Rajya Sabha
• In case of a disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill, the
president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve the
deadlock.
©StudyIQ Education
Financial Bills (II) - Article 117 (3)
• Contains provisions involving expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India,
but does not include any of the matters mentioned in Article 110.
• It is treated as an ordinary bill and in all respects.
• Financial bill (II) can be introduced in either House of Parliament and
recommendation of the President is not necessary for its introduction.
• It can be either rejected or amended by either House of Parliament.
• In case of a disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill, the President
can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve the deadlock.
©StudyIQ Education
Joint Sitting of Two Houses - Art 108
Joint sitting is an extraordinary machinery provided by the Constitution to
resolve a deadlock between the two Houses over the passage of a bill.
A deadlock is deemed to have taken place under any one of the following three
situations after a bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to the
other House:
1. if the bill is rejected by the other House;
2. if the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be made in
the bill; or
3. if more than six months have elapsed from the date of the receipt of the
bill by the other House without the bill being passed by it.
©StudyIQ Education
• In the above 3 situations, the president can summon a joint sitting for the
purpose of deliberating and voting on the bill.
• It must be noted here that the provision of joint sitting is applicable to
ordinary bills or financial bills only and not to money bills or Constitutional
amendment bills.
• In the case of a money bill, the Lok Sabha has overriding powers, while a
Constitutional amendment bill must be passed by each House separately.
©StudyIQ Education
• If the bill (under dispute) has already lapsed due to the dissolution of the
Lok Sabha, no joint sitting can be summoned.
• But, the joint sitting can be held if the Lok Sabha is dissolved after the
President has notified his intention to summon such a sitting (as the bill
does not lapse in this case). After the President notifies his intention to
summon a joint sitting of the two Houses, none of the Houses can proceed
further with the bill.
©StudyIQ Education
• The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting of the two Houses and
the Deputy Speaker, in his absence.
• If the Deputy Speaker is also absent from a joint sitting, the Deputy Chairman
of Rajya Sabha presides.
• If he is also absent, such other person as may be determined by the members
present at the joint sitting, presides over the meeting.
• Chairman of Rajya Sabha does not preside over a joint sitting as he is not a

supplementary questions cannot follow.
3. A short notice question is one that is asked by giving a notice of less than ten
days. It is answered orally.

• It is called the first tough peasant rebellion
against the rule of the East India Company.

settlement that would be permanent in
nature

including Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Palamau and
Manbhum.

they lost to modern weapons of the British.
Kol Rebellion (1832)

independence underneath their chiefs
but the British entry threatened their
independence.
• The handover of tribal lands and the
encroachment of moneylenders,
merchants and British laws generated a
lot of pressure.
• The Kol tribal planned an insurgency in
1831-32 which was engaged primarily
against Government officers and private
money-lenders.
Mappila Rebellion in Malabar (1841-1920)
• Mappila uprising was sequences of
rebellions by the Mappila Muslims
of Malabar region of Kerala.
• The main causes were, increase in
land tax, security of tenure and
exploitation of the poor peasantry
by the landlords.
• The revolt goes fell into the trap of
Hindu-Muslim riot.
Moplah Rebellion in Malabar
• The social and economic background of the Moplahs was heterogeneous.
• Certain rich Moplahs earned their livelihood as traders and merchants.
• The landlords belonged to the high- caste Hindus.
• The Moplah Peasant Movement started in August 1921.
• During this time Malabar was under the British rule.
• The government officials in alliance with the Hindu landlords oppressed the
Moplah peasants.
• The Moplah tenants agitated against the Hindu landlords and the British
government.
• Most of their grievances were related to security of tenure, high rents, renewal
fees, and other unfair exactions of the landlords.
Santhal Rebellion (1855)
• It was a native rebellion in present
day Jharkhand against both the British
colonial authority and zamindari
system by the Santhal people.
• It was planned by four Murmu
brothers -Sidhu, Kahnu, Chand and
Bhairav.
• The rebellion was suppressed
thoroughly and largely shadowed by
that of the other rebellions.
Indigo Rebellion (1859-60)
• Indigo was recognized as a chief
cash crop for the East India
Company’s investments.
• It is also known as Nilbidroha
• This indigo revolt gave birth to a
political movement and stimulated
national sentiment against the
British rulers among Indian masses.
Deccan Uprising (1875)
• Along with the Permanent Settlement, British extended their presence
beyond Bengal.
• Ryotwari Settlement was the revenue system that was introduced in the
Bombay Deccan region.
• The revolt started in Poona and henceforth it spread to Ahmednagar.
• This uprising also involved social boycott of the moneylender.
Munda Ulgulan (1899- 1900)
• Birsa Munda-led this movement in the region
south of Ranchi.
• The Mundas conventionally enjoyed a special
rent rate as the original clearer (Khuntkatti) of
the forest.
• But this was eroded by the jaghirdars and
thikadars arrived as traders and moneylenders.
• As a result of this rebellion, government
enacted Chotanagpur Tenancy Act 1908,
recognized Khuntkatti rights, banned Beth
Begari (forced labor)
Other Movements
• Ramosi Revolt
 It took place in the Western Ghats in 1882-1889 under Phadke.
• Pabna Revolt
 It took place in 1872-76 due to the atrocities committed by the
zamindars.
• Bijolia Movement
 It occurred in Rajasthan due to 86 different taxes being imposed
on the peasants.
Peasant Movements in Bihar
• After the Champaran Satyagraha in 1917, Bihar became an important centre
for peasant movements.
• These activities had addressed the problems of share croppers such as
abolition of customary non-rent payments, regulation of eviction, and fixation
of fair rent.
• The main centre of the movements was north Bihar.
• The Bihar Kisan Sabha, started in 1927, developed as an extensive organization
under the leadership of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati.
• It was the strongest section of the All-India Kisan Sabha.
• With passage of Zamindari Abolition Act,1949, the movements disappeared.
Kisan Sabha and Khet Mazdoor Sabha
in Uttar Pradesh
• Kisan sabhas were started in U.P. in 1926-27.
• Their main demands centred on problems of tenants, such as giving
tenants occupancy rights, abolishing non-rent extraction and forced
labour, cancelling all rent arrears, reducing rent and water rates.
• This led to the establishment of the Khet Mazdoor Sabha in 1959.
Tebhaga Movement in Bengal
• Despite repeated famines in the Bengal region, the tenants were forced to
surrender half of their produce to the landlords.
• The famine was worsened when the jotedar (landlord) class were indulged
in hoarding and black marketing of food grains.
• In 1946, the All India Kisan Sabha started the Tebhaga movement,
demanding that tenants be allowed to keep two-thirds of the produce.
• The movement received the massive support from agricultural labourers.
• The movement declined in 1947 due to crackdowns by the police, and the
divisions that developed within the movement along religious lines.
Telangana Movement
• One of the most politically effective peasant movements was seen in the
erstwhile State of Hyderabad.
• In Telangana region, the land ownership was in the hands of very few
ruling class people.
• The actual cultivators of the land were subjected to high rent, increasing
indebtedness and a system of free labour (also known as the vetti system).
• The Communist Party of India took up these issues as the basis for a
peasant’s struggle against feudalism in the period 1946-48.

Physical Quantities,
Units And Measurement
By Dr Vipan Goyal

• Physical quantities are often divided into fundamental and derived
quantities.
• Fundamental quantities are not defined in terms of other physical
quantities like length, mass and time etc.
• The measurement of physical quantities involves two steps:
 The choice of standard (unit)
 The comparison of the standard to the quantity to be measured.
• In 1960, the general Conference of weights and measures recommended
that a metric system of measurements called the international system of
units, abbreviated as SI units.
• There are other methods for measurements like CGS system (Centimeter,
gram etc) and British engineering system (foots, pound, second etc)
• In practice, large distances are expressed in kilometers, wavelengths of
light in angstrom(Å) (10-10m) and nuclear size in femtometers ( 10-15m).
• The astronomical distances, e.g., the distance of a star from the earth, are
expressed in light years. (9.4607 × 1012 km)
• An astronomical unit is the mean distance from the centre of the earth to
the centre of the sun. (149.6 million kilometres)
• A parsec is the distance at which an astronomical unit subtends an angle
of one second of arc. (3.26 light years)
Unit of measurement
• A quantity which is used as a standard of measurement is called
Unit of measurement. There are usually two types of units –
• Fundamental unit – All those units which are independent of any
other unit are called Fundamental units.
• There are seven fundamental units.
SI BASE QUANTITIES AND UNITS

Unit of measurement
• Supplementary Units
 Plane Angles Radian Rad
 Solid Angles Steradian Sr
2. Derived Units – All those units which are expressed in terms of
two or more fundamental units is called Derived Units. For e.g.
velocity (m/s), Accelaration, Force etc.
• Dimensions of Physical Quantities – The dimensions of a physical
quantity are expressed in terms of powers of Fundamental
quantities. For e.g. Velocity=L/T=[LT-1]=[M0LT-1].
MULTIPLES AND SUBMULTIPLES OF SI
UNITS – THE METRE
Derived units
• Derived units are defined as products of powers of the
fundamental units.
• There are derived units with special names, usually names of
scientists and symbols for their units.
• Eg . Newtons[N], Pascal [Pa] etc.

India, Tropical or Temperate Country?
• The temperate part (north of Tropic of Cancer) is twice the
area of tropical part.
• But India has always been treated as a tropical country for
two different reasons – physical and cultural.
Physical Geographical Reasons
• The country is separated from the rest of Asia by Himalayas.
• Its climate is dominated by the tropical monsoons and the temperate air
masses are blocked by Himalayas.
• Entire area south of the Himalayas is essentially tropical from climatic
point of view. Although the night temperatures in Winter at several places
in North India may come down to the level of those prevailing in
temperate lands, yet clear skies and intense isolation raise the day
temperatures to a tropical level.
Cultural Geographical Reasons
• Settlements, diseases, agricultural and primary economic
activities are all tropical in nature.
• It is primarily because of Himalayas that India is a tropical
country.
India -Evolution
India -Evolution
• As per the estimation, the earth is approximately 460 million years
old.
• The endogenic and exogenic forces played a significant role in giving
shape to various surface and subsurface features of the earth.
• The theory of Plate Tectonics defines the formation of physical
aspects of the earth.
India -Evolution
• Initially, all continents were united (there
was one landmass), and known as Pangea
or Super Continent.
• The northern part of the ancient super
continent Pangea was named as ‘Angara
Land’ or Laurasia and the southern part
was named as ‘Gondwana Land’.
• The Gondwana Land includes India,
Australia, South Africa, South America,
and Antarctica.
India -Structure
• Based on geological history, India
is divided into three regions.
• The regions are:
 The Peninsular Block;
 The Himalayas & other Peninsular
Mountains; and
 Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra Plain.

Physiography of India
Part- 2
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Physiography
India’s physiography is divided into
six following regions:
The Northern and Northeastern
Mountains
The Northern Plain
The Peninsular Plateau
The Indian Desert
The Coastal Plains
The Islands
Northern and Northeastern Mountains
Himalayan Mountains
Northern and Northeastern Mountains
Himalayan Mountains
• Young and structurally fold mountains stretch
over the northern borders of India
• Run in a west-east direction from the Indus to the
Brahmaputra formed by the tectonic collision of
the Indian plateau with the Eurasian plateau
• form an arc, which covers a distance of about
2,400 Km in length with varying width from 400
Km in Kashmir to 160 Km Arunachal Pradesh
• The altitudinal variations are greater in the
eastern part than in the western
The Trans Himalayas
The Trans Himalayas
• Himalayan Ranges immediately to the north of
the The Great Himalayan Range are called the
Trans Himalayas.
• Most of the part of this Himalayan range lies in
the Tibet and hence also called Tibetan Himalaya
• The Zaskar, K2 (Godwin austin), the Ladakh, the
Kailash and the Karakoram are the main ranges
of the trans Himalayan system.
The Trans Himalayas
The Trans Himalayas
• The longest glacier is Siachen in the Nubra
Valley.
• Biafo, Baltaro, Batura, Hispar are other glaciers.
• The area is largest snow field outside the polar
regions.
POINT: K2 is the the highest peak in India. It lies in
Karakoram Range. Kangchenjunga in Sikkim is also
the 2
nd highest peak in India. It is also the highest
Himalayan peak in India.
Greater or Inner Himalayas/Himadri
Greater or Inner Himalayas/Himadri
• Most continuous range consisting of the loftiest peaks with an
average height of 6,000 metres
• Contains all the prominent Himalayan peaks with
core of this part of Himalayas is composed of granite
• Perennially snow bound, and a number of glaciers descend from
this range
Greater or Inner Himalayas/Himadri
• Prominent Ranges
 Mt. Everest (Sagarmatha or Chomo Langma) 8848m in Nepal
 Mt. Kangchenjunga 8598m in India
 Mt.Dhaulagiri 8172 m in Nepal
 Mt. Nanga Parbat 8126m in India
 Mt. Nanda devi 7817m In India
Greater or Inner Himalayas/Himadri
• There are few passes in
this range like Shipki La
and Bara Lacha La in HP.
• Burzil, Banihal and Zozila in
Kashmir
• Niti, Lipulekh and Thag La
in Uttarakhand
• Jelep La and Nathu La in
Sikkim.
The Lesser Himalaya or Himachal
• Altitude varies between 3,700 to 4,500
meters and the average width is of 50 Km
• While The Pir Panjal range forms the
longest and the most important range,
The Dhaula Dhar & The Mahabharat
ranges are also prominent ones.
• Consists of the famous valley of Kashmir
and the Kangra & Kullu Valley in Himachal
Pradesh (Majority of hill stations lies in
this range)
Outer Himalayas/The Shiwaliks
• The altitude varies between 900 to
1100 km and the width varies
between 10 to 50 km
• Forms the foothills and lies between
the lesser Himalayas and the plains.
• The longitudinal valleys lying
between the Himachal and
Shiwaliks are called ‘Dun’ for e.g.
DehraDun, Kotli Dun and Patli Dun
Eastern Hills and Mountains
Eastern Hills and Mountains
• The Brahmaputra marks the eastern border
of the Himalayas. Beyond the Dihang gorge,
the Himalayas bend sharply towards south
and form the Eastern hills or Purvanchal.
• These hills run through the north eastern
states of India & are mostly composed of
sandstones for ex. Patkai Hills, Naga Hills,
Manipuri Hills and Mizo Hills
Himalayan Regions from East to West
Punjab Himalayas
• This part lies between the Indus and
Sutlej – 560 km
• From west to east, this is also known as
Kashmir Himalaya and Himachal Himalaya;
respectively.
• Karakoram, Ladakh, Pir Panjal, Zaskar and
Dhaola Dhar are the main ranges of this
section
Kashmir Himalayas
• The Kashmir Himalayas are also
popular for the Karewa
formations, which are useful for
the cultivation of Zafran, a local
variety of saffron.
• Karewas are the thick deposits of
glacial clay and other materials
embedded with moraines (glacial
debris).
Kumaon Himalayas
• This part lies between Sutlej and Kali rivers – 320 km
• Its western part is called Garhwal Himalaya while
the eastern part is known as Kumaon Himalaya
• The general elevation is higher as compared to Punjab
Himalayas
• Nanda Devi, Kamet, Trisul, Badrinath, Kedamath,
Gangotri are important peaks.
• The sources of sacred rivers like the Ganga and the
Yamuna are located in the Kumaon Himalayas
• Nainital and Bhimtal are important lakes
Nepal Himalayas
• This part lies between the Kali and Tista rivers
– 800 km
• This is the tallest section of the Himalayas
and is crowned by several peaks of perpetual
snow
• Important peaks include Mount Everest,
Kanchenjunga, Makalu, Dhaula Giri and
Annapurna
• Kathmandu is a famous valley in this region
Assam Himalayas
• This part lies between the Tista and Dihang
rivers – 750 km
• Has elevation much lesser than that of the
Nepal Himalayas
• Important peaks of this region are Namcha
Barwa, Kula Kangri and Chomo Lhari
Northern Plains
Northern Plains
• Formed by the interplay of the three major river
systems, namely– the Indus, the Ganga and
the Brahmaputra along with their tributaries.
• The northern plains are formed by the alluvial
deposits brought by these 3 rivers
• The rivers which were previously flowing into Tethys
sea (Before Indian Plate collided with Eurasian Plate –
continental drift, plate tectonics) deposited huge
amount of sediments in the Tethys Geosyncline.
[Geosyncline – a huge depression]
Northern Plains
• Himalayas are formed out of these sediments which were
uplifted, folded and compressed due to northern movement
of Indian Plate.
• Northern movement of Indian Plate also created a trough to
the south of Himalayas.
Northern Plains
• During the initial stages of upliftment of sediments, the already existing rivers
changed their course several times and they were rejuvenated each time
(perpetual youth stage of rivers {Fluvial Landforms}).
• The rejuvenation is associated with intense headward and vertical
downcutting of the soft strata overlying the harder rock stratum.
• Headward erosion and vertical erosion of the river valley in the initial stages,
lateral erosion in later stages contributed huge amount of conglomerates
(detritus)(rock debris, silt, clay etc.) which were carried downslope.
Northern Plains
• [Head ward erosion = Erosion at the origin of a stream channel, which
causes the origin to move back away from the direction of the stream
flow, and so causes the stream channel to lengthen]
• These conglomerates were deposited in the depression (Indo-Gangetic
Trough or Indo-Gangetic syncline) (the base of the geosyncline is a
hard crystalline rock) between peninsular India and the convergent
boundary (the region of present day Himalayas).
Northern Plains
• Composed of alluvial soil which has been
deposited over millions of years, about 2400 km
long and about 240 to 320 km broad.
• With a rich soil cover combined with adequate
water supply and favorable climate, it is
agriculturally a very productive part of India
• Divided into three sections, viz. the Punjab Plain,
the Ganga Plain and the Brahmaputra Plain.
Punjab Plains
• Form the western part of the
northern plain & formed by the
Indus and its tributaries with major
portion of this plains in Pakistan
Ganga Plains
• Extends between Ghaggar
and Tista rivers. The
northern states, Haryana,
Delhi, UP, Bihar, part of
Jharkhand and West Bengal
lie in the Ganga plains.
Bramhaputra Plains
• This plain forms the eastern part
of the northern plain and lies in
Assam
• Based on the relief features; the
northern plain can be divided
into four regions, viz. bhabar,
terai, bhangar and khadar
Bramhaputra Plains
Bramhaputra Plains
Bhabar
• It is a narrow, porous, northern
most stretch of Indo-Gangetic plain.
• It is about 8-16 km wide running in eastwest direction along the foothills (alluvial
fans) of the Shiwaliks.
• They show a remarkable continuity from
the Indus to the Tista.
• The width of this belt is about 8 to 16 km;
lies parallel to the Shiwaliks.
Bhabar
• The porosity of bhabar is the most unique feature.
• The porosity is due to deposition of huge number
of pebbles and rock debris across the alluvial fans.
• The streams disappear once they reach the bhabar
region because of this porosity.
• All the rivers disappear in this region
• The area is not suitable for agriculture and only big
trees with large roots thrive in this belt.
Terai
• The terai region lies towards south of the bhabar
belt.
• In this region, the streams reappear and make a
wet, swampy and marshy region
• These streams again re-emerge in Tarai region.
• The south of Tarai is a belt consisting of old and
new alluvial deposits known as the Bhangar and
Khadar accordingly.
Terai
• The Terai is more marked in the eastern part than in
the west because the eastern parts receive
comparatively higher amount of rainfall.
• Most of the Terai land, especially in Punjab, Uttar
Pradesh and Uttarakhand, has been turned into
agricultural land which gives good crops
of sugarcane, rice and wheat.
Bhangar
• Bhangar is the largest part of the northern plain
and is composed of the oldest alluvial soil.
• They lie above the flood plains & resemble
terraces.
• The soil of this region is locally known as kankar
and is composed of calcareous deposits
• ‘The Barind plains’ in the deltaic region of Bengal
and the ‘bhur formations’ in the middle Ganga and
Yamuna doab are regional variations of Bhangar.
Bhangar
• [Bhur denotes an elevated piece of land situated along the banks of
the Ganga river especially in the upper Ganga-Yamuna Doab. This
has been formed due to accumulation of wind-blown sands during
the hot dry months of the year]
• Bhangar contains fossils of animals like rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
elephants, etc.
Khadar
• The floodplains formed by younger
alluvium are called khadar.
• The soil in this region is renewed
every year and is thus highly fertile.
• This makes them the most fertile
soils of Ganges
Significance of Himalayas
• Influence on Indian Climate
• Defense
• Source of Rivers
• Fertile Soil
• Hydroelectricity
• Forest Wealth
• Agriculture
• Tourism
• Cultural Tourism
• Mineral Resources in Himalayas
Influence on Indian Climate
• They intercept the summer monsoons coming from the Bay of Bengal and
Arabian Sea causing precipitation in the entire Ganga Plains, North-Eastern
Hills.
• They direct the monsoon winds towards north-western India (Punjab,
Haryana etc.. But these regions receive most of the rainfall due
to Western Disturbances coming from the Mediterranean regions).
• They protect northern-plains from the cold continental air masses of
central Asia.
Mineral Resources in Himalayas
• Geosynclinical deposits in tertiary rocks are
regions of potential coal and oil reserves.
• Coal is found in Kashmir, Copper, lead, zinc, gold,
silver, limestone, semi-precious and precious
stones occur at some places in the Himalayas.
Peninsular Mountains

Mountains, Rajasthan:
World’s oldest
Guru shikhar is
the highest peak
on which Mount
Abu is situated.

• The highest peak of Peninsular India is Anaimudi
(2695 m) in Anaimalai Hills.
• Cardamom Hills or Ealaimalai Hills is the southern
most range of India.
Peninsular Plateau
• The peninsular plateau is triangular in shape & surrounded
by hills, composed of the oldest rocks as it was formed
from the drifted part of the Gondwana land
• Broad & shallow valleys and rounded hills are the
characteristic features of this plateau.
• The plateau can be broadly divided into two regions, viz.
the Central Highlands and the Deccan Plateau.
Peninsular Plateau
Peninsular Plateau
The Central Highlands
• The Central Highlands lies to the north of the Narmada River &
covers the major portion of the Malwa plateau.
• The rivers in this region flow from southwest to northeast; which
indicates the slope of this region.
• It is wider in the west and narrower in the east.
• Bundelkhand (UP&MP) and Baghelkhand (MP&UP) mark the
eastward extension of this plateau.
• The plateau further extends eastwards into the Chhotanagpur
plateau (Jharkhand)
The Central Highlands & Deccan Plateau
Deccan Plateau
• Largest plateau in India, making up most
of the southern part of the country, lies
to the south of the Naramada River &
shaped as downward-pointing triangle.
• It is located between two mountain
ranges, the Western Ghats and
the Eastern Ghats.
Deccan Plateau
• Each rises from its respective nearby coastal plain almost meet at the
southern tip of India.
• The average elevation of Western Ghats is 900 – 1600 metres; compared
to 600 metres in case of Eastern Ghats.
• It is separated from the Gangetic plain to the north by the
Satpura and Vindhya Ranges, which form its northern boundary
• Home of thick dark soil (called regur), suitable for cotton cultivation
Deccan Plateau
Important points
• The Peninsular Block is made up of a series of patland plateaus such as the
Hazaribagh plateau, the Palamu plateau, the Ranchi plateau, (Jharkhand) the
Malwa plateau (MP and Rajasthan), the Coimbatore plateau, and the
Karnataka plateau.
• Delhi ridge in the northwest, (extension of Aravalli’s), the Rajmahal hills in the
east, Gir range in the west and the Cardamom hills in the south are the
peripheral parts of the Peninsular Block.
• Western Ghats is known by different local names. They are known as Sahyadri
in Maharashtra; Nilgiri hills in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu; and Anaimalai hills,
and Cardamom hills in Kerala.
• Located on the Anaimalai hills of the Western Ghats Anaimudi
(2,695 m) is the highest peak of Peninsular plateau, followed by
Dodabetta (2,637 m) on the Nilgiri hills.
• Thal (mumbai-nashik), Bhor, and the Pal Ghats (TN & Kerala) are
the important passes of the Western Ghats.
• The Eastern Ghats stretch from the Mahanadi Valley in the north to
the Nilgiris in the south.
• The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous and irregular and dissected by
many rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal.
• Rajmahal hills and the Meghalaya plateau are the part of the Northeastern
Plateau.
• The Meghalaya plateau is further sub-divided as the Garo Hills; the Khasi
Hills; and the Jaintia Hills.
• Meghalaya plateau is rich in mineral resources. The most significant of
these resources are coal, iron ore, sillimanite, limestone, and uranium.
Indian Desert
• The Great Indian Desert, also known as the Thar Desert, lies in the northwest
of the Aravalli hills.
• This region gets scanty rainfall which is less than 150 mm in a year, Hence they
climate is arid and vegetation is scanty.
• Luni is the only prominent river but some streams appear during rainy season.
• The Aravali Hills lie on the western and north western margins of the
peninsular plateau. These are highly eroded hills and are found as broken hills
between Gujarat and Delhi.
Indian Desert
Coastal Plains
• The Peninsular plateau
is flanked by stretch of
narrow coastal strips
which run along the
Arabian Sea on the
west and along the Bay
of Bengal on the east.
Western Coastal Plains
• The Western Coastal Plains is a thin strip of coastal plain 50
kilometers in width, much less than its eastern counterpart,
between the west coast of India and the Western Ghats hills,
which starts near the south of river Tapi
• The plains begin at Gujarat in the north and end at Kerala in
the south including the states
of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka
• The western coastal plains are an example of submerged
coastal plain.
• The Gulf of Kutch and the Gulf of Khambat lie on the northern
part
Western Coastal Plains
• Kathiawar Coast → Kutch to Daman
(Tapti, Narmada, Sabarmati & Mahi river deposit huge
load of sediments in the Gulf of Cambay & form
estuaries)
• Konkan Coast → Between Daman & Goa
• Kannada Coast → Between Goa to Cannanore
• Kanyakumari Coast → Between Cannanore to Cape
Camorin
• Malabar coast à Kannada Coast + Kanyakumari Coast
• The Malabar Coast has certain distinctive features such
as Kayals (backwaters), which are used for fishing,
inland navigation, and these backwaters hold a special
attraction for the tourists.
Western coastal plane is mainly divided
into followin sections
Eastern Coastal Plains
• Refer to a wide stretch of landmass
of India, lying between the Eastern
Ghats and the Bay of Bengal.
• These plains are wider and level as
compared to the western coastal plains.
• It stretches from Tamil Nadu in the south
to West Bengal in the north.
Eastern Coastal Plains
• Utkal coast → Deltaic plains of Ganga to Mahanadi
delta (Famous Chilka lake is located in this plain)
• Andhra Coast → Utkal plains to Pulicat lake
(Contains deltas of Godavari & Krishna Rivers, &
famous Kolleru lake)
• Northern Circars → Utkal Coast + Andhra Coast
(Between Mahanadi & Krishna)
• Coromandal Coast → Between Krishna &
Kanyakumari (Consist of Kaveri Delta)
• In comparison to the western coastal plains, the
eastern coastal plain is broader and is an example of
an Emergent coast.
Eastern coastal plane is mainly divided into
following sections
Significance of the Coastal Plains
• Large parts of the coastal plains of India are
covered by fertile soils on which different
crops are grown. Rice is the main crop of
these areas.
• Coconut trees grow all along the coast.
• The entire length of the coast is dotted with
big and small ports which help in carrying
out trade.
• The sedimentary rocks of these plains are
said to contain large deposits of mineral oil
(KG Basin).
Significance of the Coastal Plains
• The sands of Kerala coast have large quantity
of MONAZITE which is used for nuclear power.
• Fishing is an important occupation of the
people living in the coastal areas.
• Low lying areas of Gujarat are famous for
producing salt.
• Kerala backwaters are important tourist
destinations.
• Goa provides good beaches. This is also an
important tourist destination.
The Islands
The Islands
• The major islands groups of India are Andaman and Nicobar
Archipelago (A chain of islands similar in origin) in Bay of Bengal and
Lakshadweep islands in Arabian Sea.
• Andaman and Nicobar Islands were formed due to collision
between Indian Plate and Burma Minor Plate [part of Eurasian
Plate][Similar to formation of Himalayas].
• Andaman and Nicobar Islands are southward extension of Arakan
Yoma range [Myanmar][Arakan Yoma in itself is an extension of
Purvanchal Hills].
The Islands
• Lakshadweep Islands are coral islands. These islands are a
part Reunion Hotspot volcanism.
• Other than these two groups there are islands in Indo-Gangetic
Delta [they are more a part of delta than islands] and between
India and Sri Lanka [Remnants of Adams Bridge; formed due to
submergence].
Andaman and Nicobar islands
• The Andaman islands are divided into three main islands i.e. North,
Middle and South.
• Duncan passage separates Little Andaman from South Andaman.
• The Great Andaman group of islands in the north is separated by the Ten
Degree Channel from the Nicobar group in the south .
• Port Blair, the capital of Andaman Nicobar Islands lies in the South Andaman.
• Among the Nicobar islands, the Great Nicobar is the largest. It is the
southernmost island and is very close to Sumatra island of Indonesia.
Andaman and Nicobar islands
• The Car Nicobar is the northernmost.
• Most of these islands are made of tertiary sandstone, limestone and shale
resting on basic and ultrabasic volcanoes [Similar to Himalayas].
• THE BARREN (active) AND NARCONDAM ISLANDS (Dormant), north of
Port Blair, are volcanic islands [There are no active volcanoes in main
land India].
• Some of the islands are fringed with coral reefs. Many of them are
covered with thick forests. Most of the islands are mountainous.
• Saddle peak (737 m) in North Andaman is the highest peak.
Lakshadweep Islands
In the Arabian Sea, there are three types of islands.
• Amindivi Islands (consisting of six main islands of Amini,
Keltan, Chetlat, Kadmat, Bitra and Perumul Par).
• Laccadive Islands (consisting of five major islands of Androth,
Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Pitti and Suheli Par) and
• Minicoy Island.
• At present these islands are collectively known as Lakshadweep.
• They are widely scattered about 200-500 km south-west of the Kerala coast.
• Amendivi Islands are the northern most while the Minicoy island is the
southernmost.
• The largest and the most advanced is the Minicoy island with an area of 4.53 sq km.
• Islands in India → in Bay of Bengal and in the Arabian Sea
• The Bay of Bengal island group consists of over 500 islands/islets.
• The two principal groups of islets include the Ritchie’s archipelago
and the Labyrinth Islands.
• Few coral islands in the Gulf of Mannar also
• Andaman and Nicobar Islands in Bay of Bengal consist of hard
volcanic rocks
• The middle Andaman and Nicobar Islands are the largest islands of India
• Lakshadweep islands in the Arabian Sea are formed by corals
• The southern – most point of India is in Nicobar Island, known as Indira
Point
• Formerly Indira point was called Pygmalion Point, it is submerged now,
after 2004 Tsunami
• However, the entire group of islands is divided into two broad categories –
the Andaman in the north and the Nicobar in the south and they are
separated by Ten Degree Channel.
Miscellaneous points
• Tropic of cancer divides the India into 2 parts, and Udaipur city of Tripura
is closest to it.
• Zero mile stone- Britishers considered Nagpur to be the centre of India
and hence identified this point and constructed the zero mile stone.
• Kuttanad, Kerala has the lowest altitude in India.
• Pamir popularly known as Roof of the world is the connecting link
between Himalayas and high ranges of central Asia
• UP borders the maximum number of states.
• Tropic of Cancer passes through 8 states : Gujarat, Rajasthan, MP,
Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, WB, Tripura and Mizoram.
Miscellaneous points
• Indian Standard Meridian passes through 5 states: UP, MP, Chhattisgarh,
Odisha, Andhra Pradesh.
• 9 states from the coast of India. They are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa,
Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal.
• 2 UTs Daman & Diu and Puducherry are also along the coast.
• UTs of Andaman and Nicobar islands and Lakshadweep are made up of
islands only.
• Patkai Hills separate India from Myanmar.
• India shares the longest border with Bangladesh then China, Pakistan,

Positives and Achievements
• Emphasis on infrastructure developments and capacity building,
investments were made in education, energy, industry, railways and
irrigation.
• India became self-sufficient in agriculture
• Nationalization of banks, green revolution, liberalisation, privatisation and
inclusion occurs.
• Emphasis on social justice, governance, employment generation, poverty
alleviation, health and skill development.
Negatives and Problems
• The drawbacks of the planning adopted via PC includes:
 No structural mechanism for regular engagement with states.
 Ineffective forum for the resolution of centre-state and inter-ministerial
issues.
 Inadequate capacity expertise and domain knowledge; weak networks
with think tanks and lack of access to expertise outside government.
 Failed to implement land reforms.
 It was a toothless body, was not able to make union/states/UTs
answerable for not achieving the targets.
 Designed plans with ‘one size fit for all’ approach. Hence, many plans
failed to show tangible results.
 Weak implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
Why does India need a change from PC?
• Today we are living in a globalised world connected by modern transport,
media, communications and networked international institutions and
markets.
• With the increasing levels of development, the aspirations of people have
soared from survival to safety and surplus.
• So governance systems need to be transformed to keep up with the same.
• Change in the economic scenario where the government is supposed to be
an enabler rather than a player or provider of first and last.

Funding
Money-Allocations
• After scrapping the planning commission, government wanted the
Finance commission to oversee all three types of “moneyallocations” i.e.
 Share from union taxes
 CSS: Centrally sponsored schemes
 Union’s assistance to state’s plans.
Types of Economic Planning
• In today’s world, most economies are mixed economies.
• The planning can be of several types as discussed below:
• Indicative Planning
• It puts forward / indicates to some broad principles and guidelines to achieve some goals.
Not much specific particulars.
• Comprehensive / Imperative Planning
• Refers to centralized planning and implementation with allocation of resources
• Used by socialist countries and each and every aspect of planning is controlled by state.
• Core planning
• PC asks the states to submit their projected revenue estimates. PC determines the
expenditure heads for state annual plans. This helps in keeping the plan target to realistic
limits and prevents diversion of funds from the priority items to the non plan items.
• Structural Planning
• Aims to change the existing structures
• Functional Planning
• Aims to achieve the objectives without making much changes to existing structural
framework
• Centralized Planning
• One central authority formulates plan, targets and priorities for all sectors. Also called Top
bottom
• Decentralized planning
• Multi-level planning in which more than one institutions work for implementation
• Perspective Planning
• Refers to Long term planning 15-20-25 years. Implemented by breaking the plan period into
smaller plans such as 5 years
New Economic Policy
• New Economic Policy refers to economic liberalisation or relaxation in the
import tariffs, deregulation of markets or opening the markets for private and
foreign players, and reduction of taxes to expand the economic wings of the
country.
• Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is considered to be the father of New
Economic Policy (NEP) of India. Manmohan Singh introduced the NEP on July
24,1991.

• Beginning with mid-1991, the govt. has made some radical changes in its policies related to foreign
trade, Foreign Direct Investment, exchange rate, industry, fiscal discipline etc.
• The thrust of the New Economic Policy has been towards creating a more competitive environment in
the economy as a means to improving the productivity and efficiency of the system. This was to be
achieved by removing the barriers to entry and the restrictions on the growth of firms.

Plateaus and
Plains
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Plateaus
• A plateau is an elevated area
with a more or less levelled land
on its top. It has a large area on
its top and a steep slope on its
sides.
• They are also called as high
plains or tablelands.
• The plateaus cover about 18% of
the earth’s land surface and take
up one third of the Earths land.
• The Deccan plateau in India is
one of the oldest plateaus.
• Valleys form when river water cuts
through the plateau.
• Example : The Columbia Plateau,
between the Cascade and Rocky
mountains in the northwestern
United States, is cut through by the
Columbia River.
CLASSIFICATION OF PLATEAUS
• On the basis of their geographical location and
structure of rocks, the plateaus can be classified as:
• Intermontane Plateaus
• Piedmont plateaus
• Continental plateaus
• Volcanic plateaus
• Dissected plateaus
Intermontane Plateaus
• The plateaus which are bordering the mountain
ranges (generally fold mountains) or are partly or
fully enclosed within them are the intermontane
plateaus.
• The word ‘intermontane’ means ‘between
mountains’.
• Intermontane plateaus are the highest in the world.
• They have nearly horizontal rock layers which are
raised to very heights by vertical movements of the
earth.
• Examples: The Plateau of Tibet is an example of the
intermontane plateau which is surrounded by the
fold mountains like the Himalayas, the Karakoram,
the Kunlun and the Tien Shah.
Piedmont Plateaus
• Plateaus which is situated at the foot of a
mountain and is locked on the other side by a
plain or a sea/ ocean is called as a piedmont
plateau.
• The word ‘piedmont’ means ‘foot of a
mountain’.
• They are also called as Plateaus of
denudation as the areas once were high to
the level of mountains, have now been
reduced to the foot level of the mountain by
various agents of erosion.
• Examples: The Malwa Plateau (Madhya
Pradesh ) is an example of piedmont plateau.
Continental Plateaus
• They are formed either by an extensive
continental upliftment or by the spread
of horizontal basic lava (less viscous)
sheets completely covering the original
topography.
• This kind of plateaus shows an abrupt
elevation in contrast to the nearby
lowland or sea (i.e. more steepness on
sides).
• The Continental Plateaus are also
known as Plateaus of Accumulation.
• Examples: Plateau of Maharashtra is an
example of the continental plateau.
Volcanic Plateaus
• A volcanic plateau is a plateau
produced by volcanic activity. There
are two main types: lava plateaus and
pyroclastic plateaus.
• Lava plateaus are formed by highly
fluid basaltic lava during numerous
successive eruptions through
numerous vents without violent
explosions.
• Pyroclastic volcanic plateaus are
produced by massive pyroclastic flows
and they are underlain by pyroclastic
rocks.
Dissected Plateaus
• A dissected plateau is a plateau area
that has been severely eroded so
that the relief is sharp. Such an area
may appear as mountainous.
• Dissected plateaus are
distinguishable from orogenic
mountain belts by the lack of
folding, metamorphism, extensive
faulting.
 MAJOR PLATEAUS OF THE WORLD
Tibetan Plateau
• Highest and largest plateau in the world and
hence called the ‘roof of the world’.
• Formed due to collision of the Indo-Australian
and Eurasian tectonic plates.
• The plateau is sufficiently high enough to drive
the monsoons of India towards the south.
• It covers most of the Autonomous Tibetan
Region, part of Western China, and a part of
Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir.
• It is surrounded by mountains to the south by
the Himalayan Range, to the northeast by
the Kunlun Range, and to the west by
the Karakoram Range.
Columbia – Snake Plateau
• River Columbia and its tributary
Snake meet in this plateau.
• It is bordered by the Cascade
Range and Rocky Mountains and
divided by the Columbia River.
• This plateau has been formed as
the result of volcanic eruptions
with a consequent coating
of basalt lava (Flood Basalt
Plateau).
Colorado Plateau
• It is the largest plateau in
America.
• It is divided by the Colorado
River and the Grand Canyon.
• This plateau is an example of
intermontane plateau.
• The plateau is known for the
groundwater which is under
positive pressure and causes the
emergence of springs
called Artesian wells.
Deccan Plateau
• Deccan Plateau is a large plateau which forms
most of the southern part of India.
• It is bordered by two mountain ranges, the
Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats.
• The plateau includes the Deccan Traps which is
the largest volcanic feature on Earth.
• Made of multiple basalt layers or lava flows.
• The Deccan Traps are known for containing
some unique fossils.
• The Deccan is rich in minerals. Primary mineral
ores found in this region are mica and iron ore
in the Chotanagpur region, and diamonds, gold
and other metals in the Golconda region.
Kimberley and Katanga Plateau
• Kimberley Plateau
 Lies in the northern part of Australia.
 This plateau is made of volcanic eruption.
 Many minerals like iron, gold, lead, zinc,
silver and diamond are found here.
 Diamond is also found here.
• Katanga Plateau
 It is lying in Congo.
 It is famous for copper production.
 Other minerals like Cobalt, Uranium, Zinc,
Silver, Gold and Tin are also mined here.
Mascarene and Laurentian Plateau
• Mascarene Plateau
 Plateaus also form in the ocean,
such as the Mascarene Plateau
in the Indian Ocean.
 It extends between the
Seychelles and Mauritius
Islands.
• Laurentian Plateau
 Lying in the eastern part of
Canada, it is a part of Canadian
Shield.
 Fine quality of iron-ore is found
here.
Mexican and Patagonian Plateau
• Mexican Plateau
 It is called as ‘Mineral Store’. Different types
of metallic minerals like silver, copper etc. are
obtained from here.
 World’s biggest silver mine Chihuahua is
situated in the plateau.
• Patagonian Plateau
 It is a Piedmont plateau (Arid Landforms)
lying in southern part of Argentina.
 It is a rain shadow desert plateau.
 It is an important region for sheep rearing.
Bolivian and Massif Central Plateau
• Altiplano Plateau or Bolivian
Plateau
 It is an intermontane plateau which
is located between two ranges of
Andes Mountain.
 It is a major area of Tin reserves.
• Massif Central
 This plateau lies in the central
France.
 It is famous for Grapes cultivation.
Anatolian Plateau
• Anatolian Plateau
 Also known as Asia Minor, most
of Turkey lies on this plateau.
 It is an intermontane plateau
lying between Pontiac and
Taurus Mountain ranges.
 Tigris – Euphrates Rivers flow
through this plateau.
 Precious wool producing
Angora goats are found here.
Spanish Plateau and Loess Plateau
• Spanish Plateau or Iberian
Plateau: It is situated in the middle
of Spain. It is a lava plateau. It is rich
in minerals like Iron.
• Loess Plateau: It is in China. The soil
here is made of fine particles
brought by the wind. This fine
loamy soil is extremely productive.
Crops grown in this soil along
the Yellow River give great yields.
Potwar, Bavarian and Ahaggar Plateau
• Potwar Plateau: It is situated
in northern plateau (Punjab)
region of Pakistan. Its
average ‘Salt Range’ is
located to the south-west of
the plateau.
• Bavarian Plateau: Southern
part of Germany.
• Ahaggar Plateau: A small
plateau located in Algeria,
Sahara.
Plains
• Plains are the most important landforms found on the earth surface.
• A plain is nothing but a low-lying relatively flat land surface with very
gentle slope and minimum local relief.
• About 55% of the earth’s land surface is occupied by plains.
• Most of the plain have been formed by deposition of sediments brought
down by rivers.
• Besides rivers, some plains have also been formed by the action of the
wind, moving ice and tectonic activities
• Plains usually are the best land of a country & are heavily cultivated &
populated
CLASSIFICATION OF PLAINS
• On the basis of their mode of formation,
plains can be classified as:
• Structural plain
• Erosional plains
• Depositional plains
Structural Plains
• These plains are mainly formed by the
upliftment of a part of the sea floor or
continental shelf.
• They are located on the borders of
almost all the major continents.
• They are formed by horizontally bedded
rocks, relatively undisturbed by the
crustal movements of the earth
• Examples include Russian Platforms,
Great plains of USA & Central lowlands
of Australia
Erosional Plains (Peneplains)
• Erosional plains are formed by the continuous
and longtime erosion of uplands.
• The surface of such plains is hardly smooth and
hence, they are also called as Peneplains,
which means almost plain.
• These plains are carved by the agents of
erosion (Rain, river, ice, and wind)
• However scooped out by the ice are now filled
by the lakes for ex. in Northern Europe &
Northern Canada.
• Finland is estimated to have 35000 lakes
occupying 10 % of total land surface of the
country
Depositional Plains
• These plains are formed by the depositional
activity of various geomorphic agents.
• When plains are formed by the river
deposits, they are called as riverine or
alluvial plains.
• The depositions of sediments in a lake give
rise to a Lacustrine Plain or Lake Plains.
• Example : The Valley of Kashmir .
• When plains are formed by glacial deposits,
they are called as Glacial or Drift Plains.
• When the wind is the major agent of
deposition, those plains are called as Loess
Plains.

Delimitation
Commission
POLITICAL PARTIES
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

Delimitation Commission
• What is Delimitation?
• Delimitation literally means the act or process of fixing limits or
boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country to represent
changes in population.
• Why Delimitation?
• To provide equal representation to equal segments of a population.
• Fair division of geographical areas so that one political party doesn’t
have an advantage over others in an election.
• To follow the principle of “One Vote One Value”.
How delimitation is carried out?
• Under Article 82, the Parliament enacts a Delimitation Act after every Census.
• Under Article 170, States also get divided into territorial constituencies as per
Delimitation Act after every Census.
• Once the Act is in force, the Union government sets up a Delimitation
Commission.
• The first delimitation exercise was carried out by the President (with the help of
the Election Commission) in 1950-51.
• The Delimitation Commission Act was enacted in 1952.
• Delimitation Commissions have been set up four times — 1952, 1963, 1973 and
2002 under the Acts of 1952, 1962, 1972 and 2002.
• There was no delimitation after the 1981 and 1991 Censuses.
Delimitation Commission
• The Delimitation Commission is appointed by the President of India
and works in collaboration with the Election Commission of India.
• Composition:
• Retired Supreme Court judge
• Chief Election Commissioner
• Respective State Election Commissioners
• Functions:
To determine the number and boundaries of constituencies to make
population of all constituencies nearly equal.
• To identify seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes, wherever their population is relatively large.
• Although the freeze on the number of seats in Lok Sabha and
Assemblies should have been lifted after the 2001 Census, another
amendment has postponed this until 2026.
• Political parties are voluntary associations or organised groups of individuals who share
the same political views and who try to gain political power through constitutional
means and who desire to work for promoting the national interest.
There are three kinds of party systems in the world, viz.,
(i) one party system in which only one ruling party exists and no opposition is
permitted, as for example, in the former communist countries like the USSR and
other East European countries;
(ii) two-party system in which two major parties exists, as for example, in USA and
Britain; and
(iii) multi-party system in which there are a number of political parties leading to the
formation of coalition governments, as for example, in France, Switzerland and Italy.
Political Parties
Recognition of National and State Parties
The Election Commission registers political parties for the purpose of
elections and grants them recognition as national or state parties on the
basis of their poll performance.
The other parties are simply declared as registered-unrecognised parties
Conditions for Recognition as a National Party:
At present a party is recognised as a national party if any of the following conditions is
fulfilled :
1. If it secures 6% of valid votes polled in any 4 or more states at a general election to
the Lok Sabha or to the legislative assembly; and, in addition, it wins 4 seats in the Lok
Sabha from any state or states; or
2. If it wins 2 % of seats in the Lok Sabha at a general election; and these candidates
are elected from three states; or
3. If it is recognised as a state party in 4 states.
Conditions for Recognition as a State Party :
At present , a party is recognised as a state party in a state if any of the following conditions is
fulfilled :
1. If it secures 6 % of the valid votes polled in the state at a general election to the legislative
assembly of the state concerned; and, in addition, it wins 2 seats in the assembly of the
state concerned; or
2. If it secures 6 % of the valid votes polled in the state at a general election to the Lok Sabha
from the state concerned; and, in addition, it wins 1 seat in the Lok Sabha from the state
concerned; or
3. If it wins 3 % of seats in the legislative assembly at a general election to the legislative
assembly of the state concerned or 3 seats in the assembly, whichever is more; or
4. If it wins 1 seat in the Lok Sabha for every 25 seats or any fraction thereof allotted to the
state at a general election to the Lok Sabha from the state concerned; or
5. If it secures 8 % of the total valid votes polled in the state at a General Election to the Lok
Sabha from the state or to the legislative assembly of the state. (This condition was added
in 2011)

Delhi Manifesto
 On November 2, 1929, a conference of prominent national leaders issued a
“Delhi Manifesto” which demanded:
 that the purpose of the Round Table Conferences (RTC), promised by Lord
Irwin, should be to formulate a scheme for implementation of the dominion
status;
 that the Congress should have majority representation at the conference;
 Amnesty and a general policy of conciliation
Viceroy Irwin rejected these demands on December 23, 1929, which led to the
demand of Purna Swaraj in Lahore session of INC.
 The following major decisions were taken at the Lahore session of INC in
December 1929
1. The Round Table Conference was to be boycotted
2. Complete independence (Poorna Swaraj) declared as the aim of the Congress
3. CWC authorised to launch a programme of civil disobedience
4. January 26, 1930 fixed as the first Independence Day, to be celebrated
everywhere.
 December 31, 1929 - at midnight on the banks of River Ravi, the newly adopted
tricolour flag of freedom was hoisted amidst slogans of Inquilab Zindabad.
 On January 26, 1930, the declaration of Poorna Swarajya was publicly issued
 Nehru made an appeal to volunteers across the country to join the civil
disobedience movement
* INC celebrated Independence day every year on 26 Jan since 1930
 Gandhi was given the opportunity to start the first act of civil disobedience
by the INC
 To carry forward the mandate given by the Lahore Congress, Gandhi
presented eleven demands to the Government & gave an ultimatum of
January 31, 1930 to accept or reject these demands.
 Gandhi’s Eleven Demands
1. Reduce expenditure on Army and civil services by 50 per cent.
2. Introduce total prohibition (of alcohol and other intoxicants)
3. Carry out reforms in Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
4. Change Arms Act allowing popular control of issue of firearms licence
5. Release political prisoners.
6. Accept Postal Reservation Bill.
7. Reduce rupee-sterling exchange ratio
8. Introduce textile protection.
9. Reserve coastal shipping for Indians.
10. Reduce land revenue by 50 per cent.
11. Abolish salt tax and government’s salt monopoly.
 Gandhi, along with 78 members of Sabarmati Ashram, was to march from
his headquarters in Ahmedabad, through the villages of Gujarat, towards
Dandi
 Gandhi would address thousands of people and attack the government in
his speeches everyday
 Gandhi talked to foreign journalists and wrote articles for newspapers on the
way. This pushed the Indian independence movement into the forefront of
world media. Gandhiji became a household name in the West.
 Gandhi broke the salt law by picking up a handful of salt at Dandi on April
6,1930
 50,000 people had joined him by then
Why Salt?
 Issue Resonates with common man as everyone uses Salt
 Indians had been making salt from seawater free of cost until the passing of the
1882 Salt Act that gave the British monopoly over the production of salt and
authority to impose a salt tax
 It was a criminal offence to violate the salt act.
Gandhi gave the following directions for future action -
 Wherever possible civil disobedience of the salt law should be started.
 Foreign liquor and cloth shops can be picketed.
 Refuse to pay taxes
 Lawyers can give up practice.
 Public can boycott law courts by refraining from litigation.
 Government servants can resign from their posts.
 All these should be subject to one condition - truth and non-violence as
means to attain Swaraj should be faithfully adhered to
 Spinning clothes by using charkha
 Fighting untouchability
Local leaders should be obeyed after Gandhi’s arrest
 Tamil Nadu - RAJAJI led salt march from Trichirapally to Vedaranniyam
 Kerala/Malabar -K Kelappan led a march from Calicut to Poyannur
 Assam – Sylhet to Noakhali march by volunteers
 Andhra Pradesh too saw marches to make salt
 Nehru arrested in April
 Gandhi arrested in May when he tried to lead a raid on Dharsana Salt works
 Around 60,000 people were arrested by the government.
 There was widespread civil disobedience carried on by the people. Apart
from the salt tax, other unpopular tax laws were being defied like the forest
laws, chowkidar tax, land tax, etc.
 The government tried to suppress the movement with more laws and
censorships.
 The Congress Party was declared illegal. But this did not deter the
satyagrahis who continued the movement.
 There were some incidents of violence in Calcutta and Karachi but Gandhiji
did not call off the movement unlike the previous time with the noncooperation movement.
 Thousands of women also took part in the Satyagraha.
 Foreign clothes were boycotted. Liqueur shops were picketed. There were
strikes all over.
Chittagong
 Surya Sen’s Chittagong Revolt Group carried out a raid on two armouries
 Declared the establishment of a provisional government
Peshawar
 Led by Gandhian Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan.
 In April 1930 he was arrested.
 Khan’s followers (called Khudai Khidmatgars) whom he had trained in
Satyagraha had gathered in a marketplace called the Qissa Khwani Bazaar.
 There they were fired upon by the British Indian Army despite being
unarmed.
Impact of Agitation
 Imports of foreign cloth and other items fell.
 Government income from liquor, excise and land revenue fell.
 Elections to Legislative Assembly were largely boycotted.
 The British government was shaken by the movement. Also, its non-violent
nature made it difficult for them to suppress it violently.
 This movement had three main effects:
 It pushed Indian freedom struggle into the limelight in western media.
 It brought a lot of people including women and the depressed classes directly
in touch with the freedom movement.
 It showed the power of the non-violent Satyagraha as a tool in fighting
imperialism.
 Every section of society as Students, Women, Tribals, Merchants and Petty
Traders, Workers & Peasants took active part in CDM.
 Although Muslims participated but their participation was nowhere near the
1920-22 level because of appeals by Muslim leaders to stay away from the
movement - The active government encouragement to communal dissension
was working
 Lord Irwin called Gandhi and Congress for talks finally in January 1931

Factors of Population Distribution in India
Physical factors such as Climate, Terrain and Availability of water
• North Indian Plains, deltas and Coastal Plains have climate suitable for
agriculture and fertile plains hence have higher proportion of population
• Mountainous and forested regions of southern and central Indian States,
Himalayan states, and some of the north-eastern states are less populated
• Development of irrigation (Rajasthan), availability of mineral and energy
resources (Jharkhand) and development of transport network (Peninsular
States) have resulted in moderate to high proportion of population.
Factors of Population Distribution in India
Socio-economic and historical factors
• Traditional settled agriculture and early human settlement has
resulted in large population in river plains and coastal areas of
India
• Development of transport and better agricultural development
has resulted in large population in North Plains
Factors of Population Distribution in India
Industrialization and urbanization
• Metro cities of India have high concentration of population
due to industrial development and urbanization.
• A large numbers of rural-urban migrants come to these towns
Phases of Growth of Indian Population
• 1911-1921 → Even recorded a negative
growth rate
• Both the birth rate and death rate were
high
• Major causes → Poor health and medical
services, illiteracy of people at large, &
inefficient distribution system of food
1901-
1921 → Referred
as a period of
stationary phase
of growth of
India’s
population
Phases of Growth of Indian Population
• An overall improvement in health and
sanitation throughout the country
• Better transport and communication
system improved distribution system
• The crude birth rate remained high in
this period leading to higher growth
rate than the previous phase
1921-
1951 → Referred
as the period of
steady
population
growth
Phases of Growth of Indian Population
• Caused by a rapid fall in the death rate but a high birth
rate
• The average annual growth rate was as high as 2.2 %
• High birth rate was due to better living conditions &
scientific developments
• Due to increased international immigration from Tibet,
Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan; India’s growth rate
exploded
1951-
1981 → Referred
as the period of
population
explosion in
India
Phases of Growth of Indian Population
• Due to decline in crude birth rate
• Due to an increase in the mean age at
marriage
• Improvement in female literacy &
empowerment
• Better scientific developments & access
to common man
After 1981 till
present, the
growth rate
has started
slowing down
gradually
Problems due to Higher Population in India
Unemployment
Poverty
Uneven Migration
Urbanization problems
Regional disparities
Increase in crime rate
Environmental Degradation
Impact of population growth on the
Indian Economy
Adverse effects on savings
Unproductive investment
Slow growth of Per Capita Income
Underutilization of labor
Growing pressure on land
Adverse effect on quality of population
Adverse social impact
Population Density
• The density of population is expressed as the number of
persons per unit area.
• The density of population in India as per 2011 census is 382
persons per square km.
• Bihar with 1102 people per square km is the most densely
populated state of India followed by West Bengal (1029) and
Uttar Pradesh (828).
Population Density
• Definitions :
• Physiological density refers to the total population divided by
the net cultivated area.
• Agricultural density refers to the total agricultural population
divided by the net cultivable area.
• Agricultural population includes cultivators and agricultural
laborers and their family members.
Modern Indian Cities
Based on the population size, the census of India classifies urban
centers into six classes
• CLASSES POPULATION
• Class I 100,000 and above
• Class II 50,000 to 99,999
• Class III 20,000 to 49,999
• Class IV 10,000 to 19,999
• Class V 5,000 to 9,999
• Class VI less than 5000
Modern Indian Cities
• The cities with population beyond five million are known as mega
cities.
• Urban agglomeration forms in a situation when a town and its
adjoining urban areas outgrowth, or two or more contiguous towns
with or without their outgrowth, or a city and one or more
adjoining towns with their outgrowth together forming a
contiguous spread.
• More than 60 per cent of urban population in India lives in Class I
towns.
India: Migration
• Causes of migration are categorized as
• ‘Push factors’ and
• ‘Pull factors’
India: Migration
• Causes of Migration
 Push factors force people to migrate; for example,
unemployment, lack of infrastructure (such as hospital,
education institutions, etc.), natural disasters (such as flood,
drought, earthquake, cyclone, etc.), local conflicts, war, etc.
 Pull factors attract people from different places; for example,
better opportunities for education and employment; better
health facilities; and various sources of entertainment, etc.
India: Migration
• Causes of Migration
 Normally, the reason behind female migration throughout India
is largely marriage related; however, Meghalaya has a reverse
scenario.
 Remittances from the international migrants are one of the
major sources of foreign exchange.
 For thousands of the poor villages of states like Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, etc.
remittance acts as life blood for their subsistence.
Tribes of India
• Officially recognized by the Indian government as
“Scheduled Tribes” in the Fifth Schedule of the
Constitution of India
• Often grouped together with scheduled castes in
the category “Scheduled Castes and Tribes”
• Eligible for certain constitutional benefits & perks

technology leading to poverty are generally illiterate & unaware of
world’s progress
Shyness of contact Have a marginal degree of contact with other cultures and people
Have distinctive culture, language and religion
Problems of Tribal People
Poverty
Illiteracy

Present Case
Nowadays, Large development projects undertaken by the government also
encroaches upon their land.
Large scale displacements and unsatisfactory compensation and
rehabilitation are common place, leading to further backwardness and
seclusion.
Because of their diversity they lack a common voice to bargain collectively

Population Census
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Population Census
• 1872: Lord Mayo conducted Census for the first time in India.
• 1881: Lord Ripon started census every decade. (conducted after every 10
years)
• Census Act 1948 under Home Ministry
• Data conducted by Registrar General and Census Commissioner
• 2011= 7th Census of Free India.
Demographic transition → Census perspective
• 1) Stagnant Population (1901-1921) where Birth rate is High and Death
rate is also High.
 In Census 1921 our population had declined (-0.31%) compared to
1911, due to WW1, Drought, Epidemics, Spanish flu influenza.
 This happened only once throughout the demographic history of India,
so 1921 is called the year of great divide.
• 2) Steady Growth (1921-1951) where Birth rate is High and Death rate is
Medium.
 Called ‘Mortality induced growth’ because death rate had declined
Demographic transition → Census perspective
• 3) Rapid High Growth (1951-1981) where Birth rate is High and Death rate
is Low.
 Agriculture revolution, medical research, life expectancy increased.
 Result is population explosion / ‘Fertility induced growth’
• 4) High Growth with Definite Signs of Slowing Down (1981-2011) where
Birth rate is Medium to low and Death rate is Lower.
Malthusian Theory of Population Growth
• A British scholar Thomas Robert Malthus (1798) noted,
 Food production increases in arithmetic progression (1,3,5,7) while
population increases in geometric progression (sequence 2, 6, 18, 54
with a common multiple of 3).
 Therefore, Nature itself tries to establish equilibrium between
population vs food supply, using ‘Positive Checks such as famine,
epidemics, earthquake.
 Malthus also advised humans to initiate ‘Preventative Checks to
control population growth e.g. family planning, late marriages, and
celibacy.
DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS
• Population density: Number of people per square kilometer.
 − It was 382 in 2011
• Decadal pop. growth rate
 It is the Population in (Latest Census2011 – Last
Census2001/Last Census2001.
 − It was 17.7% in 2011
• Birth Rate − Number of live births per 1000 population.
 − It’s ~20 in 2016
DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS
• Death Rate − Number of live deaths per 1000 population.
 − It’s ~6 in 2016
• Population’s Growth Rate
 It is the difference between the birth rate and the death rate.
 If it’s a positive figure then country is witnessing a rate of
natural increase in population.
 When it’s close to zero then population is said to be ‘stabilized’
or has reached the ‘replacement level’.
DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS
• Fertility Rate
 number of live births per 1000 women in the child-bearing age group
(15 to 49 years).
• Total Fertility Rate
 Total number of children born or likely to be born to a woman in her
life time if she were subject to the prevailing rate of agespecific fertility in the population.
 TFR of about 2.1 children per woman is called Replacementlevel fertility
 IMR: Infant Mortality Rate = number infant deaths under the age of 1
year per 1000 live births. It’s ~34/1000 in 2016
DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS
• CMR: Child Mortality Rate = number child deaths under the age of
5 years per 1000 live births. It’s ~50 in 2016.
• MMR: Maternal Mortality Ratio = number of women who die in
childbirth per 1 lakh live births. It’s ~130 in 2016..
• Life Expectancy
 Estimated number of years that an average person is expected
to survive. Indian Females (70), Males (67)
DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS
• Sex Ratio - Sex Ratio = number of females per 1000 males.
• 2011 census, it is 943.
• Child Sex Ratio = girls (0-6 years) per 1000 boys in that age group.
 All India declined from 927 (2001) → 919 (2011).
DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS
• Dependency Ratio (%) = (population below 15 or above 64) divided
by population in the 15-64 age group.
 Demographic dividend = phenomenon when dependency ratio
of a country declines, and it witnesses larger proportion of
people in the working age compared to dependency age.

• India after Mauryas was a not a very remarkable
period for political solidarity but it saw development
of Indian culture to a great extent.After the
successors of Ashoka failed to keep the empire
intact, various small kingdoms emerged in the face of
Indian subcontinent. The Mauryan Dynasty was soon
replaced by the Sunga dynasty.

by Satavahanas.
Location
Satna District of MP. Was on a major
trade route from western coastal regions
to Pataliputra.
A very large complex 13-14km from Vidisha, the
capital of Mauryan Empire. Vidisha was a very
important trading town. It was on the Dakshinapath
– an offshoot of the Uttarapath, which connected
Taxila to Pataliputra and further east.

Poverty and
Unemployment
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Poverty & Poverty Line in India
The Planning Commission of India (Now NITI Aayog)
periodically estimates poverty lines and poverty ratios for each
year for which Large Sample Surveys on Household Consumer
Expenditure have been conducted by the National Sample
Survey Office (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and
Programmee Implementation.
How Poverty is defined?
• Poverty is the lack of sufficient money to meet the minimum standard of
living-including food, clothing, shelter, health and education.
• It was based on minimum daily requirement of 2,400 and 2,100 calories
for an adult in rural and urban areas, respectively.
Reasons Behind Poverty in India
• 1. Poor fiscal capacity of the government due to tax evasion and avoidance
versus large population
• Poor Public healthcare, education, housing, water & sanitation infra.
 Educational outcomes are poor, illiteracy, lack of vocational skills
 Unemployment, Underemployment, Disguised Unemployment is
there.
 Unhygienic slums leads to Disease .
• 2. Lack of family planning so higher birth rate and leads to child labour.
• 3. Large family so insufficient food and malnutrition leads to insufficient
mental & physical capacity to pursue better economic opportunities.
Reasons Behind Poverty in India
• 4. Low asset base : Most of the rural households don’t possess land, milch
animals, farm machinery or sufficient bank deposits so reduces their
capacity to generate self-employment / business opportunities.
• 5. Lack of financial planning
• 6. Leakages in the poverty removal programs
• 7. Lack of financial inclusion.
• 8. Majority of labour engaged in unorganized / informal sector
• 9. Social barriers faced by SC / ST / Minorities in advancing economically in
rural area.
Measurement and Estimation
• World Bank: ~21% Indian population is poor
• World Bank’s International Poverty Line stands at person living daily on
US$1.90 (PPP exchange rate).
• So, a person who spends less than an absolute amount ‘US$1.90’ a day is
considered ‘Below International Poverty line’ and classified as poor.
• So, spending $1.91 is non-poor while $1.89 is poor. This is an example of
“Absolute Poverty” measured with an artificial line.
• The result is usually expressed in Poverty Head Count Ratio (HCR) i.e.
proportion of a population that lives, below this poverty line.
Measurement and Estimation
• 2011: India’s 21.2% population classified as poor by World Bank’s method.
• But, 2018 Nigeria took over India.
• World bank aims to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
• Relative Poverty : Households are arranged in ascending order of annual
income i.e. Households earning less than x% of median income is classified
as poor.
• Thus it measures poverty ‘relative’ or ‘compared‘ to how much others are
earning.
Poverty Line
• The old formula for estimating the poverty line is based on the desired calorie
requirement.
• Food items such as cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, oil, sugar etc. together provide
these needed calories.
• The accepted average calorie requirement in India is 2400 calories per person per
day in rural areas and 2100 calories per person per day in urban areas.
• Since people living in rural areas engage themselves in more physical work, calorie
requirements in rural areas are considered to be higher than urban areas.
• On the basis of these calculations, for the year 2000, the poverty line for a person
was fixed at Rs 328 per month for the rural areas and Rs 454 for the urban areas.
• In this way in the year 2000, a family of five members living in rural areas and
earning less than about Rs 1,640 per month will be below the poverty line.

Generating programmes
• 1. Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP):
 The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP), which was
introduced in 1978-79 and universalized from 2nd October, 1980,
aimed at providing assistance to the rural poor in the form of subsidy
and bank credit for productive employment opportunities through
successive plan periods.
 On 1st April, 1999, the IRDP and allied programmes were merged into
a single programme known as Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana
(SGSY).
 The SGSY emphasizes on organizing the rural poor into self-help
groups, capacity-building, planning of activity clusters, infrastructure
support, technology, credit and marketing linkages.

 Self Help groups are formed at the village level to help the needy.
 Now it is called Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana .
Anti poverty measures and Employment
Generating programmes
• 9. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna:
 The cabinet on March 21, 2015 cleared the scheme to provide
skill training to 1.4 million youth with an overall outlay of Rs.
1120 crore.
 This plan is implemented with the help of Ministry of Skill
Development and Entrepreneurship through the National Skill
Development Corporation.
 It will focus on fresh entrant to the labour market, especially
labour market and class X and XII dropouts.
Anti poverty measures and Employment
Generating programmes
• 10. National Heritage Development and Augmentation Yojna (HRIDAY):
 HRIDAY scheme was launched (21 Jan. 2015) to preserve and rejuvenate the
rich cultural heritage of the country.
 This Rs. 500 crore programme was launched by Urban Development Ministry in
New Delhi.
 Initially it is launched in 12 cities: Amritsar, Varanasi, Gaya, Puri, Ajmer,
Mathura, Dwarka, Badami, Velankanni, Kanchipuram, Warangal and Amarvati.
 These programmes played/are playing a very crucial role in the development of
the all sections of the society so that the concept of holistic development can
be ensured in the real sense.
Inequality
• Gini Coefficient− Italian
statistician Corrado Gini(1912)’s a
formula for measuring inequality.
 0 or 0% = perfect equality; 1 or
100% = perfect inequality.
 India’s Gini coefficient
degraded from 81% (2013) to
85% (2018), which proves
inequalities increasing in India.
Kuznets Curve
• The Kuznets Curve is a graph used in
economics that says that as an economy
develops, market forces first cause a rise
in the economic inequality, then closes
the gap in economic inequality.
• A justification for this kind of a
progression is that early on in the
development stage of an economy,
investment opportunities increase for
those who possess money, and the
arrival of cheap rural labour into the
urban areas would suppress wages.
Kuznets Curve
• Inequality lowers the rate of growth
by dropping educational levels since
poor and disadvantaged people do
not have the necessary finance for
their education in inadequate credit
markets.
Lorenz Curve
• The Lorenz Curve (the actual
distribution of income curve), a
graphical distribution of wealth
developed by Max Lorenz in 1906,
shows the proportion of income
earned by any given percentage of the
population.
• The line at the 45º angle shows
perfectly equal income distribution,
while the other line shows the actual
distribution of income.
• The further away from the diagonal,
the more unequal the size of the
distribution of income.
Poverty Line
• Alagh Committee (1979) : Adult daily calories intake: 2100 (Urban), 2400
(Rural). If a person is not getting this much calorie he is Below Poverty Line (BPL)
• Lakadwalla (1993) : Calories Intake, Clothing and Shelter
• Suresh Tendulkar committee (2005-09) : Setup by Planning Commission, this
Committee defined poverty line at monthly per capita expenditure ₹ 27 (rural),
₹ 33 ( urban).
 As per Tendulkar method, 22 %(All India), 25.7% (Rural India), 13.7% (Urban
area) in 2011-12 of Indians living below poverty line.
 State/UT that have higher % poverty than 21.9%: Uttar Pradesh < Madhya
Pradesh < Assam < Odisha < Bihar < Arunachal Pradesh < Manipur <
Jharkhand < Dadra & Nagar Haveli < Chhattisgarh (most poor)
Poverty Line
• Rangarajan committee (2012-14) : Setup by Planning Commission,
this Committee suggested poverty line @monthly expenditure for
family of five: ₹ 4860 (Rural), ₹ 7035 (Urban).
 This generated uproar because it translates to a person spending daily
₹ 32/> (rural) or ₹ 47/> (urban) is not a poor.
UNEMPLOYMENT
• A person who is not getting daily 8 hrs works at a min wage rate.
• It is calculated by NSSO.
• Voluntary Unemployment:
 a person is out of job on his own choice. Either he wants higher wages
or doesn’t want to work at all.
• Involuntary unemployment:
 It is a situation where a person is willing to work at the prevailing wage
rates, but unable to find work due to factors beyond his control.
Types of Unemployment
• Cyclical Unemployment : mainly occurs during recession or depression when
workers are laid off on mass scale.
• Frictional Unemployment : When a person is out of one job and is searching for
another job. During this transition time, he’s deemed frictionally unemployed.
• Disquised Unemployment : Unemployment which is not visible because person
seems visibly working but his marginal productivity / contribution is zero. This is
seen in rural areas in the agriculture field.
• E.g. Farming family of 4 persons produces 200 kgs of wheat, but even if you remove
3 persons still production remains at 200 kgs.
• Seasonal Unemployment : Due to change in seasons. Example : Labourers in
Agriculture, Salt-pans, Sugar Mills, Ice-factory, Tourist spots, Marriage CateringOrchestra etc.
Types of Unemployment
• Underemployment or Educated unemployment : person is employed but
not in a befitting position or salary corresponding to his qualification. e.g.
M.Com working as Swiggy delivery boy, M. Tech working as Bank clerk and
Dentist working as Dy. Section Officer.
• This is seen in urban areas.
• Technological : Technological unemployment occurs when men are replaced
with machines e.g. textile / automobile.
• Open / Structural : Lack of jobs when person’s skill/qualification is
insufficient for the jobs available in the market e.g. post graduate student
working as clerk.
• In India Structural Unemployment is there due to lack of resources.
NSSO MEASUREMENT
 Unemployment Rate: = Total no. of unemployed / total labour force (of
all people in the working age.)
 NSSO measures unemployment in 3 different approaches viz.
• Usual Principal Activity status :- Unemployed for majority of the year.
• Current Weekly Status If not employed even 1 hr work in a week
• Current Daily Status If not employed even 1 hr work in a day.
• Daily Unemployment data is the best data to calculate Unemployment.

Preamble, Parts and
Schedules of the
Constitution
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

Introduction
The term ‘preamble’ refers to the introduction or preface to the
Constitution. It contains the summary or essence of the Constitution.
American Constitution was the first to begin with a Preamble.
The Preamble to the Indian Constitution is based on the ‘Objectives
Resolution’, drafted and moved by Pandit Nehru, and adopted by the
Constituent Assembly
Preamble of the Constitution

“We, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India
into a
 SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
and to secure to all its citizens:
JUSTICE, Social, Economic and Political;
LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all;
FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and
integrity of the Nation;
IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949,
do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS
CONSTITUTION”.

The Preamble in its present form:
1. Source of authority of the Constitution: The Preamble states that
the Constitution derives its authority from the people of India.
2. Nature of Indian State: It declares India to be of a sovereign,
socialist, secular democratic and republican polity.
3. Objectives of the Constitution: It specifies justice, liberty, equality
and fraternity as the objectives.
4. Date of adoption of the Constitution: It stipulates November 26,
1949 as the date.
Components of the Preamble
One of the controversies about the Preamble is as to whether it is a part of the
Constitution or not.
a. In the Berubari Union case (1960), the Supreme Court said that the
Preamble shows the general purposes behind the several provisions in the
Constitution, and is thus a key to the minds of the makers of the
Constitution. Despite this recognition of the significance of the Preamble,
the Supreme Court specifically opined that Preamble is not a part of the
Constitution.
b. In the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court rejected the
earlier opinion and held that Preamble is a part of the Constitution.
Preamble as a Part of the
Constitution
c. In the LIC of India case (1995) also, the Supreme Court again held that the
Preamble is an integral part of the Constitution.
*Note:
• The Preamble is neither a source of power to legislature nor a prohibition
upon the powers of legislature.
• It is non-justiciable, that is, its provisions are not enforceable in courts of law.
c. In the LIC of India case (1995) also, the Supreme Court again held that the
Preamble is an integral part of the Constitution.
*Note:
• The Preamble is neither a source of power to legislature nor a prohibition
upon the powers of legislature.
• It is non-justiciable, that is, its provisions are not enforceable in courts of law.
• The question as to whether the Preamble can be amended under Article
368 of the Constitution arose for the first time in the historic case of
Kesavananda Bharati (1973). It was urged that the Preamble cannot be
amended as it is not a part of the Constitution. The petitioner contended
that “the amending power in Article 368 cannot be used to destroy or
damage the basic elements or the fundamental features of the
Constitution, which are enshrined in the Preamble.
• The Supreme Court, however, held that the Preamble is a part of the
Constitution. The Court stated that the opinion tendered by it in the
Berubari Union (1960) in this regard was wrong, and held that the
Preamble can be amended, subject to the condition that no
amendment is done to the ‘basic features’.
Can the Preamble be amended ?

*Note:
The Preamble has been amended only once so far, in 1976, by the 42nd
Constitutional Amendment Act, which has added three new words—
Socialist, Secular and Integrity—to the Preamble.
This amendment was held to be valid.

Precipitation
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Precipitation
• Condensation of water vapor in air in form of water droplets or ice.
• When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force
of gravity, they fall on to the earth’s surface.
• So after the condensation of water vapor, the release of moisture is
known as precipitation. This may take place in liquid or solid form.
• Precipitation in the form of drops of water is called rainfall, when
the drop size is more than 5 mm.
Snowfall
• When condensation takes
place below freezing point at
0*C, conversion of water
vapour directly into solid state.
• Precipitation occurs in forms
of fine flakes of snow.
Sleet
• Sleet is frozen raindrops or refroze
melted snow water
• When a layer of temp. above
freezing point overlies a
subfreezing layer near the ground,
precipitation occurs in form of sleet
Hail
• Sometimes, drops of rains after
being released by the clouds
become solidified into small
rounded stone pieces of ice,
known as hailstones.
• Formed by rainwater passing
through colder layers hence
have several concentric layers
of ice, one over the another
Types of Rainfall
On the basis of origin, rainfall may be classified into three main types
convectional,
orographic or
relief and
cyclonic or frontal.
Precipitation in
form of water.
Also known as
cloud particles
Conventional Rainfall
• Air on being heated becomes light &
rises up as conventional currents
• As it rises, it loses heat &
consequently condensation takes
place with the formation of cumulus
clouds.
• Under these conditions, heavy
rainfall takes place along with
thunder & lightening, but does not
last for long.
• Common in Equatorial & Tropical
regions in summers daily.
Conventional Rainfall
• Convectional precipitation is heavy
but of short duration, highly
localised and is associated with
minimum amount of cloudiness.
• It occurs mainly during summer and
is common over equatorial
doldrums in the Congo basin, the
Amazon basin and the islands of
south-east Asia.
Orographic Rainfall
• When a warm & moist air currents is obstructed by a
mountain range, it is forced to ascent along its slopes.
• As the moisture laden air gains height, condensation sets
in, and soon saturation is reached. The surplus moisture
falls down as orographic precipitation along the windward
slopes.
• However, when these winds cross mountain range &
descend along its leeward side.
• Here, they get warm & dry & causes only little rain (Rain
shadow areas).
• (Some arid and semi-arid regions are a direct
consequence of rain-shadow effect. Example: Patagonian
desert in Argentina, Eastern slopes of Western Ghats). It
is also known as the relief rain.
Cyclonic or Frontal Precipitation
• Rainfall associated with cyclone is known as
cyclonic/ frontal rainfall
• Occurs along the fronts of the cyclone viz.
cold front & warm front
• At the warm front, the warm lighter wind
rises gently over the heavier cold air, which
being heavy stays close to the ground
• As the warm air rises, it cools, and the
moisture present in it condenses to form
clouds altostratus clouds
• This rain falls steadily for a few hours to a
few days.
• Cyclonic Rainfall is convectional rainfall on a
large scale.
Distribution of Precipitation
• Different places on the earth's surface receive different amounts of precipitation in a year, and that
too, in different seasons.
• High latitudes having the high pressure associated with subsiding and diverging winds, experience
rather dry conditions.
• The equatorial belt with low pressure and its converging winds, and ascending air receives ample
precipitation.
• Cold air has low capacity to hold moisture than the warm air, a general decrease in precipitation is
revealed with the increasing distance of latitude from the equator towards the poles.
• Large land masses in the middle latitudes generally experience a decrease in precipitation towards
their interiors.
• Windward mountain slopes receive abundant precipitation, while leeward slopes and adjacent low
lands fall in rain-shadow.
• The equatorial belt, the windward slopes of the mountains along the western
coasts in the cool temperate zone and the coastal areas of the monsoon lands,
receive' heavy precipitation of over 200 centimetres per annum.
• Areas adjacent to the high precipitation regime receive moderate rainfall varying
from 100 to 200 centimetres per annum.
• The central parts of the tropical land and the eastern and interior parts of the
temperate lands receive inadequate precipitation varying between 50 to 100
centimetres per annum.
• Areas lying in the rain-shadows, the interior of the continents and high latitudes
receive low precipitation i.e. less than 50 centimetres per annum
• In some regions, precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year such as in
the equatorial belt and the western parts of cool temperate regions.
• Some of the regions such as monsoon lands and the Mediterranean regions
experience seasonal rainfall.

Pre-Historic Ages
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• Evidence of Homo Erectus in the Indian subcontinent
about 2 million years ago.
• Evidence of Homo Sapiens from 70,000 years ago as
hunter-gatherers
WHAT IS PREHISTORIC?
• The distant past when there was no paper or language or the
written word, and hence no books or written document, is
called as the Prehistoric period.
• It was difficult to understand how Prehistoric people lived
until scholars began excavations in Prehistoric sites.
WHAT IS PREHISTORIC?
• Piecing together of information deduced from old tools,
habitat, bones of both animals and human beings and
drawings on the cave walls scholars have constructed fairly
accurate knowledge about what happened and how people
lived in prehistoric times.
• Paintings and drawings were the oldest art forms practiced by
human beings to express themselves using the cave wall as
their canvas
PREHISTORIC
• Ancient history can be divided into different periods
according to the tools used by people then.
1. Palaeolithic Period: 2 million BC – 10,000 BC
2. Mesolithic Period: 10,000 BC – 8000 BC
3. Neolithic Period: 8000 BC – 4000 BC
4. Chalcolithic Period: 4000 BC – 1500 BC
5. Iron Age: 1500 BC – 200 BC
Stone Age : Quaternary Age
• Quaternary stage comprises of:
• Pleistocene (20 Lakh BC – 10000 BC)
• Holocene (10000 BC – Present)
Pleistocene Age
• Roughly dressed stone tools
• No knowledge of Cultivation
• Solely living on hunting
• Lived in rock-shelters
• “Also known as Paleolithic age or Ice age or Old Stone Age &
divided into 3 ages”
Pleistocene Age
• They have been discovered throughout the country except the
alluvial plains of Indus, Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
• These tools were used for hunting, gathering as man had no
knowledge of cultivation.
• The Paleolithic age continued till 10,000 BC and is divided into
three phases according to the nature of the stone tools used
by the people.
Pleistocene Age
• It is the longest phase
divided in to 3 phases., This
is further divided into three:
1. Lower Palaeolithic Age: up
to 100,000 BC
2. Middle Palaeolithic Age:
100,000 BC – 40,000 BC
3. Upper Palaeolithic Age:
40,000 BC – 10,000 BC
Lower Palaeolithic age
• Hunters and food gatherers; tools used were axes,
choppers and cleavers.
• Earliest lower Palaeolithic site is Bori in Maharashtra.
• Limestone was also used to make tools
1. Chopper
• Using a bowl shaped
piece of stone, a heavy
and bold tool was
created. Only one side
was working.
2. Chopping tool
• Same as the chopper but with 2 edges working. Chopper and
chopping tool are characteristic of lower palaeolithic.
3. Hand axe
• A tool requiring much
greater control than the
chopper, a narrower tool
with vertical working
edge.
4. Cleaver
• Cleavers are different
from hand-axes in
having a transverse or
horizontal working edge.
Lower Palaeolithic age
• Major sites of lower
Palaeolithic age
 Soan valley (in present Pakistan)
 sites in the Thar Desert
 Kashmir
 Mewar plains
 Saurashtra
 Gujarat
 Central India
 Deccan Plateau
Lower Palaeolithic age
 Chotanagpur-plateau
(Jharkhand)
 North of the Cauvery River
 Belan valley in UP
• There are habitation sites including
caves and rock shelters
Middle Palaeolithic age
• Tools used were blades, pointers, scrapers and
borers.
• The tools were smaller, lighter and thinner
• Middle Paleolithic Age – Flake tools. They are
lighter, more precise.
1. Blades
Parallel working edges.
2. Scraper
• Parallel working edges
on the sides, similar to
blade, with the
difference being blades
are much longer than
they are wide.
3. Points
• Sharpened up to a tip:
like a point.
• Two sideways working
edges meet up to the tip.
• These are sometimes
grafted onto a wooden
handle.
Middle Palaeolithic age
• The Middle Palaeolithic tools were found in Central
India, Deccan, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu,
Karnataka, and Orissa.
Middle Palaeolithic age
• Important middle
Palaeolithic age sites
 Belan valley in UP
 Luni valley (Rajasthan)
 Son and Narmada
rivers
 Bhimbetka (MP)
Upper Palaeolithic age
• Emergence of Homo sapiens
• Major sites of Upper
Palaeolithic age
 Belan
 Son
 Chota Nagpur plateau (Bihar)
 Maharashtra
 Orissa and
 Eastern Ghats in Andhra
Pradesh
Upper Palaeolithic age
• Paintings at Bhimbetka site belong to this age.
• Lot of bone tools, including needles, blade etc.
• The tools of Upper Palaeolithic culture were characterized by
basic technological innovation in the method of producing
parallel sided blades.
UPPER PALEOLITHIC – Flint Tools
1. Burins: unlike a point,
the tip is flat like the end
of a screwdriver.
UPPER PALEOLITHIC – Flint Tools
2. Bone tools: Eg. harpoon: used
for fishing as fishing hooks. May
be one sided or two sided.
Holocene: Mesolithic Age (10000 – 8000 BC)
• Marked by phenomenal changes in climate as climate became
comparatively warm & dry which brought significant changes
in flora & fauna and made it possible for humans to move to
new areas.
• Characteristic tools of this Age: Microliths
• Transitional Phase between Paleolithic & Neolithic Age
Holocene: Mesolithic Age (10000 – 8000 BC)
• People mostly lived on Hunting, Fishing & Food gathering; At
later stage also domesticated animals.
• First animal to be domesticated was the wild ancestor of the
dog.
• Sheep and goats were the most common domesticated
animals.
• Hunting and food gathering continued.
• First human colonization of the Ganga plains.
Holocene: Mesolithic Age (10000 – 8000 BC)
• Rock Paintings from
Paleolithic & Mesolithic age
have been found at
Bhimbetka caves (Painted
birds, animals & humans)
• They are small stone tools
that were probably stuck to
stones to be used as sickles
• Tools used in Mesolithic Age
MICROLITH TOOLS
Microlith Age
• Major sites:
 Brahmagiri
(Mysore)
 Narmada
 Vindhya
 Gujarat
 UP
 Sojat
(Rajasthan)
 Bhimbetka
 Godavari
Basin
Microlith Age
• Tools used were
blades, crescents,
triangles, trapezes,
spearheads, knives,
arrowheads, sickles,
harpoons.
Holocene: Neolithic Age (New Stone Age)
(8000 – 4000 BC)
• Earliest farming communities
• Characterized by cultivation of plants &
domestication of animals
 Moving from nomadic to settled life
 Wheel discovered. Ragi, wheat and horse gram were
cultivated
 They knew how to make fire
Holocene: Neolithic Age (New Stone Age)
(8000 – 4000 BC)
• Earliest evident of Neolithic culture have been found at
Mehragarh on bank of river Bolan (Baluchistan) 7000 BC
showing beginning of agriculture & domestication of animals.
• Pottery 1
st appeared in this phase i.e. Black burnished ware +
Course Grey ware pottery for cooking
• Important Places : Gufkral ( Cave of Potters) & Burzahom in
Jammu and kashmir .
• Dog burial with the master i.e. Special feature of Burzahom
Holocene: Neolithic Age (New Stone
Age) (8000 – 4000 BC)
• Important sites:
 Burzahom (Kashmir)
 Mehrgarh (Pakistan)
 Daojali Hading (Tripura/Assam)
 Hallur (KTK)
 Paiyampalli (AP)
 Chirand (Bihar)
 Evidence of houses
NEOLITHIC AGE – Polished Tools
• We see remarkable Polished
tools. Rounded heavy tools
discovered, which could have been
possibly used to level the ground.
May have the provision for a handle
as well.
1. Celt: used for digging the ground,
like an edge.
Holocene: Chalcolithic Age (1800 – 1000 BC)
• Marked by use of copper and it is 1
st metal used in India
• Cultivation & cattle rearing along with established the knowledge of crop
rotation at Inamgaon in MHA.
• Knowledge of Irrigation & Harvesting
• Excavation reveals structures like Granaries, Embankment & Fortification
• Mud houses made of mud in circular & rectangular pattern along with
mud chulha
• Culture was limited from Udaipur to Malwa & Maharashtra
• Famous Pottery of this age is Black on Red ware
Important Chalcolithic cultures were:
• Ahar culture 2,800-1,500 B.C. / Banas culture (Rajasthan and MP) Ahar
people made a unique black-and-red ware decorated with the white
designs.
• Kayatha culture 2,450-700B.C. (MP). The Kayatha culture is distinguished
by a sturdy red-slipped ware painted with designs in chocolate color, a red
painted buff ware, and a combed ware bearing incised patterns.
• Malwa culture 1,900-1,400 B.C. (Central India and parts of Maharashtra
in the Deccan Peninsula.) The Malwa ware is slightly coarse in fabric, but
has a thick buff surface over which designs were made either in red or
black.
Important Chalcolithic cultures were:
• Jorwe culture Maharashtra state in Western India, and also reached north
into the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh. 1,500 -900 B.C. ( Jorwe ware is
painted black-on-red and has a matt surface treated with a wash.
• Prabhas culture Maharashtra 2,000-1,400 B.C.
• Rangpur culture Gujarat 1,700-1,400 B.C.
• The Prabhas and Rangpur wares both were derived from Harappan culture
and are called Lustrous Red Ware because of their glossy surface
Culture in Paleolithic
Culture in Paleolithic
• We did not get any evidence of paintings from lower or middle paleolithic
age yet.
• In the Upper Palaeolithic period, we see a proliferation of artistic
activities.
• Subjects of early works confined to simple human figures, human
activities, geometric designs, and symbols.
• First discovery of rock paintings in the world was made in India (1867-68)
by an Archaeologist, Archibold Carlleyle, twelve years before the
discovery of Altamira in Spain (site of oldest rock paintings in the world).
Culture in Paleolithic
• In India, remnants of rock paintings have been found on the
walls of caves situated in several districts of Madhya Pradesh,
Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Bihar,
and Uttarakhand.
• Some of the examples of sites early rock paintings
are Lakhudiyar in Uttarakhand, Kupgallu in Telangana,
Piklihal and Tekkalkotta in Karnataka, Bhimbetka and
Jogimara in Madhya Pradesh etc.

Culture in Paleolithic
• Paintings found here can be divided into three
categories: Man, Animal, and Geometric symbols.
• Some of the characteristics of these early paintings
are:
 Human beings are represented in a stick-like form.
Culture in Paleolithic
 A long-snouted animal, a fox, a multi-legged lizard are
main animal motifs in the early paintings (later many
animals were drawn).
 Wavy lines, rectangular filled geometric designs and a
group of dots also can be seen.
 Superimposition of paintings – earliest is Black, then red
and later White.
Culture in Paleolithic
• In the late historic, early historic and Neolithic period the
subjects of paintings developed and figures like Bulls,
Elephants,Sheep, Horses, styled human beings, tridents and
rarely vegetal motifs began to see.
• The richest paintings are reported from Vindhya range of
Madhya Pradesh and their Kaimurean extension into U.P.
• These hills are fully Palaeolithic and Mesolithic remains.
Prehistoric Paintings
• There are two major sites of excellent prehistoric paintings in
India:
• (1) Bhimbetka Caves, Foothills of Vindhya, Madhya Pradesh.
• (2) Jogimara caves Chattisgarh.
BHIMBETKA CAVES
• Continuous occupation of the caves
from 100,000 B.C– 1000 A.D
• Thus, it is considered as an evidence
of long cultural continuity.
• It was discovered in 1957-58.
• Consists of nearly 400 painted rock
shelters in five clusters.
• One of the oldest paintings in India
and the world (Upper paleolithic).
Jogimara caves
• Paintings are linear representations, in
green and dark red, of huge animal
figures, such as Tigers, Elephants,
Rhinos beside stick-like human figures.
• Mostly they are filled with geometric
patterns.
• Green paintings are of dances and red
ones of hunters

Mesolithic period Art:
• The largest number of paintings belongs to this period.
• Themes multiply but the paintings are small in size.
• Hunting scenes predominate
• Hunters in groups armed with barbed spears pointed sticks,
arrows, and bows.
Mesolithic period Art
• Mesolithic people loved to point animals.
• In some pictures, animals are chasing men and in others, they
are being chased by hunter men.
• Animals painted in a naturalistic style and humans were
depicted in a stylistic manner.
• Women are painted both in nude and clothed.
Mesolithic period Art
• Young and old equally find
places in paintings.
• Community dances provide
a common theme.
• Sort of family life can be
seen in some paintings
(woman, man, and children).
Mesolithic period Art
Chalcolithic period Art
• Copper age art.
• The paintings of this period reveal the association,
contact and mutual exchange of requirements of the
cave dwellers of this area with settled agricultural
communities of the Malwa Plateau.
• Pottery and metal tools can be seen in paintings.
Chalcolithic period Art
• Similarities with rock paintings: Common motifs
(designs/patterns like cross-hatched squares, lattices
etc)
• The difference with rock paintings: Vividness and
vitality of older periods disappear from these
paintings.
Chalcolithic period Art
OCP Culture
• A culture flourished in the upper Gangetic plains which is
uniquely identified by the use of pottery with bright red slip
and painted in black. This is known as Ochre-Colored Pottery
Culture or simply OCP Culture.
• This OCP culture was almost contemporary to the latter half
of the Mature Harappan civilization. The pottery of this
culture has been found all over the upper Gangetic plains.

OCP Culture
• It has been found during the course of excavation in the
region that the sites yielding this pottery have suffered from
extensive floods. And, it is suggested by many scholars that
the entire upper Gangetic plains was for some length of time
submerged under water.
• The people of OCP culture used copper tools and cultivated
rice, barley, gram.
• The OCP cultures have many shapes identical with the
Harappan ware.
OCP Culture
• In the excavations at Saipai (in the District of Etah), Copper
Hoard objects were found along with the OCP deposit.
• In the region of Ganga-Yamuna doab, almost all the Copper
Hoards have been found along with deposits of the OCP,
which reflects that the Copper Hoards are associated with
OCP people in doab. But their cultural association in Bihar,
Bengal, and Orissa is not clear.
• Some of the copper hoard types, mainly Celts, have been
found associated with Chalcolithic people also.

©StudyIQ Education
The Constitution provided the President with five types of pardoning powers.
• PARDON: This removes both the sentence and the conviction and completely
absolves the convict all sentences, punishments and disqualifications.
• COMMUTATION: This is the substitution of one form of punishment for a
lighter form.
Death >> Rigorous imprisonment>> Simple imprisonment >> Penalty
©StudyIQ Education
• REMISSION: Reducing the period of sentence without changing its
character.
 Rigorous imprisonment (5 years) >> Rigorous imprisonment (2 years)
• RESPITE: Awarding a lesser sentence in place of one originally awarded
because of some special circumstances .
 Ex: Offender is a Pregnant woman or has any physical disability
• REPRIEVE:It implies a stay of the execution of a sentence (especially that
of death) for a temporary period. Its purpose is to enable the convict to
have time to seek pardon or commutation from the President.
©StudyIQ Education
• Under Article 161 of the Constitution, the governor of a state also possesses
the pardoning power.
• Hence, the governor can also grant pardons, reprieves, respites and remissions
of punishment or suspend, remit and commute the sentence of any person
convicted of any offence against a state law.
• But, the pardoning power of the governor differs from that of the President in
following two respects:
1. The President can pardon sentences inflicted by court martial (military courts)
while the governor cannot.
2. The President can pardon death sentence while governor cannot.
Both the governor and the President have concurrent power in respect of
suspension, remission and commutation of death sentence.
©StudyIQ Education
5. DIPLOMATIC POWERS:
• International treaties are concluded by the President. (Subject to the
approval of the Parliament).

The Constitution of India granted 3 types of emergency powers to the
President of India.
❖ National Emergency (Article 352)
❖ State Emergency or President’s Rule (Article 356)
❖ Financial Emergency (Article 360)
©StudyIQ Education
VETO POWERS:
This is the authority of the President to withhold assent to the bills passed by
the Parliament (both the House). Article 111
The object of conferring this power on the President is to prevent hasty and
ill-considered legislation by the Parliament or prevent a legislation which may
be unconstitutional.
**Veto is for ordinary bills only and not Money bills and constitutional
amendment bills.
©StudyIQ Education
When a bill is presented to the President for his assent, he has three alternatives
(under Article 111 of the Constitution):
1. He may give his assent to the bill, or
2. He may withhold his assent to the bill, or
3. He may return the bill (if it is not a Money bill,CA bill) for reconsideration of
the Parliament.
However, if the bill is passed again by the Parliament with or without
amendments and again presented to the President, the President must give his
assent to the bill.
©StudyIQ Education
CLASSIFICATION OF VETO POWERS: • Absolute veto • Suspensive veto • Pocket veto
©StudyIQ Education
Absolute Veto:
The power of the President to withhold the assent to a bill passed by the
Parliament. The bill then ends and does not become an act. (Death of the bill)
Usually, this veto is exercised in the following two cases:
(a)With respect to private members’ bills (i.e., bills introduced by any
member of Parliament who is not a minister)
(b) With respect to the government bills when the cabinet resigns (after the
passage of the bills but before the assent by the President) and the new
cabinet advises the President not to give his assent to such bills
©StudyIQ Education
Suspensive Veto:
The President returns the bill for the reconsideration of the Parliament. If the bill
is again passed by the Parliament with or without amendments, it is obligatory for
the President to give assent to the bill.
President does not possess suspensive veto in the case of money bills.
The President can either give his assent to a money bill or withhold his assent ,but
cannot return it for the reconsideration of the Parliament.
**Normally, the President gives his assent to money bill as it is introduced in the
Parliament with his previous permission.
©StudyIQ Education
Pocket veto:
The President neither rejects nor returns the bill, but simply keeps
the bill pending for an indefinite period of time.
The President can exercise this veto power as the Constitution
does not prescribe any time-limit within which he has to take
the decision with respect to a bill presented to him for his assent.
*Pocket veto cant be exercised on the second go
©StudyIQ Education
• In 1986, President Zail Singh exercised the pocket veto with respect to the
Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill.
• The bill, passed by the Rajiv Gandhi Government, imposed restrictions on the
freedom of press and hence, was widely criticised.
• After three years, in 1989, the next President R Venkataraman sent the bill
back for reconsideration, but the new National Front Government decided to
drop the bill.
**It should be noted here that the President has no veto power in respect of a
constitutional amendment bill. The 24th Constitutional Amendment Act of
1971 made it obligatory for the President to give his assent to a constitutional
amendment bill.
©StudyIQ Education
DISCRETIONARY POWERS
• Discretion = the freedom to decide what should be done in a particular
situation.
• Wherever the constitution is silent , president may use his discretion -
 In appointing PM when no single party has majority
 On the advice of CoM - dissolving the LS , after a no confidence motion
has been passed against the council.
 In exercising pocket veto

Respiratory System
By Dr Vipan Goyal

What is human respiration?
• Respiration is the process by which energy is released from food in our
body. The function of respiratory system is to breathe in oxygen for
respiration producing energy from food, and to breathe out carbon
dioxide.
• Breathing consists of two phases, inspiration and expiration.
• Inspiration: The process of taking in air.
• Expiration: The process of blowing out air.
• Cellular respiration is the aerobic breakdown of glucose in the
mitochondria to make ATP. Respiration is an everyday term that is often
used to mean “breathing”.
Four respiration processes
• Breathing (ventilation): Air in to and out of lungs
• External respiration: Gas exchange between air and blood.
• Internal respiration: Gas exchange between blood and
tissues.
• Cellular respiration: Oxygen use to produce ATP, carbon
dioxide as waste.
Human Respiration Organs used
Structure Function
Nose/nasal cavity Warms, moistens and filters air as it is
inhaled
Pharynx Passageway for air, leads to trachea
Larynx The voice box or adam’s apple ,
where vocal chords are located
Trachea (windpipe) Keeps the windpipe “open”, trachea
is lined with fine hairs called cilia
which filter air
before it reaches the lungs
Bronchi Two branches at the end of the
trachea, each lead to a lung
Bronchioles A network of smaller branches leading
from
the bronchi into the lung tissue and
ultimately to air sacs
Alveoli The functional respiratory units in
the lungs where gases are exchanged
Human Respiratory System
• The system divides into two parts:
• Upper respiratory system
• Lower respiratory system
Upper respiratory system
• Upper respiratory tract functions;
• Passageway for respiration
Receptors for all
• Filters incoming air to filter larger
foreign material and moistens and
warms incoming air. It is a
Resonating chambers for voice
Lower respiratory tract
• Functions:
• Larynx: Maintains an open airway,
routes food and air passage
appropriately, assists in sound
production.
• Trachea: Transports air to and from
lungs
• Bronchi : Branch into lungs
• Lungs: Transport air to alveoli for gas
exchange.
About Lungs
Mechanism
• Inspiration: Air from outside come inside.
• The incoming air from nostril passes through nasal cavities then to
pharynx. Then the air is passed through the epiglottis which seperates
the food pipe and wind pipe by a thin flexible wall, then to glottis and
the air passes through larynx to trachea (cartilaginous tube), then the air
goes into the lungs via bronchioles into alveoli, a balloon like structure
where the exchange of gases takes place with the help of blood vessels
containing haemoglobin.
• Air entering the lungs contains more oxygen and less carbondioxide than
the blood that flows in the pulmonary capillaries.
• The Haemoglobin binds to oxygen that diffuses into the blood stream
• During inhalation, the diaphragm and intercostals muscles contract.
(Pressure decreases in the body)
• While during exhalation, these muscles relax. The diaphragm comes
upwards.
Gas exchange between the blood and alveoli
• Gas exchange takes place in the millions of
alveoli in the lungs and the capillaries that
envelop them.
• As shown, inhaled oxygen moves from
the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries, and
carbon dioxide moves from the blood in the
capillaries to the air in the alveoli.
• Alveoli
• The alveoli are moist, thin-walled balloon like
structure which is the site of gas exchanges. A
slightly oily
• surfactant prevents the alveolar walls from
collapsing and sticking together.
Transport Of Gases
• The transport of O2
and CO2 happens through blood.
• The RBCs in the blood carry 97% of O2 while plasma carries the remaining 3%
of O2
in a dissolved state.
• In case of CO2
, the RBCs carry about 20-25%, plasma carries 7% of CO2
in a
dissolved state while the remaining 70% is carried as bicarbonate.
• The air that we inhale has the following composition:
• Nitrogen – 78%
• Oxygen – 21%
• Carbon dioxide – 0.03 – 0.04%
• Traces of Hydrogen and Noble gases
Respiratory Problems
• Asthma
• Asthma is a chronic disease which affects the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs.
It causes difficulty in breathing and followed with a severe cough, restlessness,
cough and a wheezing sound while breathing.
• Causes of asthma
• Asthma might cause due to the following factors:
• Cold air
• Airborne allergens
• Respiratory infections
• Physical activity
• Air pollutants
•
• Emphysema
• Emphysema is defined as the chronic disease reduction of the respiratory surface
due to the damage to the lung alveolar walls. It is caused mainly by cigarette
smoking. The main symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath and
cough. Emphysema might lead to a loss of elasticity of the lungs.
• Causes of emphysema
• Emphysema may be caused by the following factors:
• Dust
• Chemicals
• Air pollution
• Smoking tobacco
• Exposure to passive cigarette smoking
• Occupational Respiratory Disorders
• Occupational respiratory disorders are defined as any disorder which
affects the respiratory system by long-term inhalation of chemicals,
proteins, and dust. For instance, Asbestosis that is caused by the
inhalation of asbestos dust.
• Long exposure can give rise to inflammation leading
to fibrosis (proliferation of fibrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung
damage. Workers in such industries should wear protective masks.
• Bronchitis: Bronchitis is a viral infection which occurs when the mucous
membrane in the bronchial passage becomes inflamed.
• It can last from six weeks to two years it is most commonly seen in heavy
smokers.
• There are two kinds of Bronchitis, Acute Bronchitis, and Chronic
Bronchitis.
• Acute Bronchitis does not last long and gets better after two or three
weeks.
• Chronic Bronchitis lasts longer from three months up to a year.
• Causes: Bronchitis is caused by basic viruses typically that cause cold and
flu. It can also be caused by bacterial infection or exposure to tobacco,
smoke, dust, and fumes which cause irritation to the lungs.
• Pneumonia: It is a swelling of one or both the lungs that is usually caused by an
infection. It could be triggered by fungi, bacteria or viruses, Pneumonia results in
fever and difficulty in breathing which could last up to 2-3 weeks.
• Pneumonia usually starts by breathing of germs into the lungs. There are different
kinds of Pneumonia like Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia, Mycoplasma
Pneumonia and other kinds.
• Causes: In most cases, it is caused by bacteria and viral infections. It is generally
seen in people who have impaired immune systems. Pneumonia can also be
caused by some forms of fungal infections.
• Symptoms: The general symptoms of Pneumonia can develop quickly and may
include. chest pain, shivering with chills, fever, dry cough, wheezing, muscle aches,
nausea, etc.
• Pulmonary edema: This condition is caused by the excess collection of
watery fluid in the lungs as this fluid accumulation makes difficult for the
lungs to function and leads to the body struggling to get enough oxygen.
• The most common cause of pulmonary edema is congestive heart failure
resulting in failure of blood circulation throughout the body.
• There are two types of pulmonary – Acute and Chronic pulmonary
edema.
• Acute pulmonary edema is short term and Chronic edema lasts longer.
• Causes: Pulmonary edema is often classified as a cardiogenic heart
problem. When the heart muscle is not able to pump effectively there is a
backup of blood returning from the lungs to the heart. This causes
pressure within the blood vessels.
• COPD
• Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases or COPD is a term used to
describe a spectrum of progressive respiratory disease.
• Here the damage caused to the lungs given rise to symptoms of
breathlessness , wheezing tightness in the chest and cough leading to
condition like chronic bronchitis and non – reversible asthma.
Lung volumes
• TV- The tidal volume is the total amount of air inhaled or exhaled during
regular respiration or relaxed breathing. Approximately 500 ml of air is utilized
during normal respiration in a healthy man.
• IRV- An inspiratory reserve volume is a supplementary volume, approximately
ranging between 2500 to 3100 ml of air which could be effectively inhaled after
the inspiration of a standard tidal volume. i.e. by deepest possible voluntary
inspiration.
• ERV- An expiratory reserve volume refers to the additional capacity of air which
is about 1200 ml are that could be forcibly exhaled out after the expiration of a
standard tidal volume.
• RV- The residual volume is about the total volume of air around 1100 ml to 1200
ml residing in the lungs after the reserve volume is emitted or breathed out.
• TLC- The total lung capacity applies to the total volume of air filled in the lungs after a
forced inspiration. The lung capacity of a healthy man is estimated to be 6000 ml.
• TLC = TV + ERV + IRV + RV
• VC – The vital capacity is the total volume of air that can be expired after maximum
inhalation approximately 80 percent TLC.
• About 4800 ml approximately 80 percent TLC.
• VC = TV + ERV + IRV
• IC- The inspiratory capacity is the total volume of air that can be inspired which is about
3600 ml.
• IC = TV + IRV
• FRC – The functional residual capacity is the total volume of air residing within the lungs
after an exhalation process and it is about 2400 ml. FRC = ERV + RV
• Respiration Centres Of The Brain
• The neuronal signals transmitted between respiratory centres of
the brain and the muscles in the chest and diaphragm modulate
respiration.
• There are three main centres of the brain that regulate breathing.
• They are present in the medulla and the pons region of the brain.
• They regulate breathing by stimulating the contraction of the
intercostal muscles and the diaphragm.
• Gas exchange by Diffusion
• Some animals simply allow gases to diffuse through their skins.
• Specialized structures
• Gills (aquatic animals) Spiracles (terrestrial insects)
• Lungs (most terrestrial vertebrates)

The rebellion is known by many names, including –
the Sepoy Mutiny
the Indian Mutiny,
the Great Rebellion,
the Revolt of 1857,
the Indian Insurrection
and India's First War of Independence
General Causes
 Discontent against British
 Product of the character and policies of colonial
rule.
 Accumulated grievances of the people against the
colonial administration.
 Dislike for the foreign regime
 Economic Exploitation
 Complete destruction of traditional economic fabric.
 British land revenue policies.
 System of law and administration.
 Twelve major and minor famines from 1770 to 1857.
 Racial Discrimination
 Exclusion from the well-paid high posts in the
administration.
 Gradual disappearance of Indian states led to the
loss of means of livelihood (case in point- Pindaris)
 British did not patronize the artisans, craftsmen etc
like the kings and Nawabs, thus they were out of
work and
Unpopular Among People
 The very foreignness nature of the British rule.
 Feeling of racial superiority among British (White man’s burden
theory)
 They treated Indians with arrogance and contempt.
 People of India started having Anti-British feeling.
Military defeats of the British Army
 The British army suffered major reverses in the
 First Anglo Afghan War (1838-42)
 Anglo Punjab Wars (1845-49)
 Crimean War (1854-56)
 These wars shattered the general belief in the invincibility of
British army.
Doctrine of Lapse
The annexation of Awadh by Lord Dalhousie came as a shock to the
people
List of states annexed
 Satara (1848)
 Jaitpur & Sambhalpur (1849)
 Baghat (1850)
 Udaipur (1852)
 Jhansi (1854)
 Nagpur (1854)
Social and Religious causes
 Activity of Christian Missionaries – conversions
 By the charter act of 1813, Missionaries were allowed to
come to India.
 1837 - Only English to be used as court language (replacing
Persian)
 1844 - The knowledge of English was made compulsory for
Government services.
 1829 Abolition of custom of Sati and Infanticide
 1843 Abolition of slavery
 1843 Prohibition of human sacrifice.
 1850 The enactment of an act which enabled a Christian
to inherit his ancestral property.
 1856 Widow remarriage act

The Immediate Cause
 The newly introduced ‘Enfield rifle’ used greased
cartridges(having cow and pig fat) - provided the spark for the
revolt.
 The use of the greased cartridges would endanger their religion.
The break-up of army in 1856was as follows:
 2,38,000 native soldiers
 45,000 British soldiers
 The Beginning and Course of The Revolt
 29 March 1857 – Sepoys at Barrackpore, Bengal refuse to use
the new rifle cartridges .
 Sepoy Mangal Pandey of the 34th Native Infantry fired on his
superior and was hanged on 6
Th April .
 24th April, 1857 - The revolt began at Meerut,58km from Delhi.
 5 sepoys of the 3rd native cavalry were hanged,85 imprisoned
 10th May - The rebellious soldiers of Meerut killed their superiors, freed
the imprisoned soldiers and marched to Delhi where they proclaimed the
aged and powerless Bahadur shah (the last Mughal) as the Emperor of
India.
 Bahadur shah was reluctant but the mutineers had overpowered the city
of Delhi already.
 June 1857 – Jhansi, Gwalior, Lucknow ,Allahabad
 The entire Bengal army soon rose in revolt which spread quickly to
Awadh, Rohilkhand, the Doab, the Bundelkhand, central India, large parts
of Bihar and the east Punjab.




 After capturing Kanpur, Nana Saheb sent Tatya Tope with 20,000 men to
aid Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi
 Jhansi – led by Rani Laxmi Bai(Manikarnika Tambe), fought with the
British army under Huge Rose.
 Defeated by British forces at her home and escaped from Jhansi
 In a daring raid, Tatya tope and Laxmibai together captured Gwalior but
they could not save Jhansi from Sir Hugh Rose.
 Tatya was an expert in guerrilla warfare. He led attacks in Rajputana,
Malwa, Panchmahal and Banswara districts.
 In Panchmahal he aimed to organize the Bhils against the British.
 Rebellion broke out in some places at Rajasthan like Auwa,
Neemuch, Kota too . Many feudal lords took up arms against their
own kings supporting British . Many cantonments also saw mutiny
 Bihar – Kunwar Singh, Zamindar of Arrah
 Faizabad – Moulvi Ahmadulla
 During the revolt, British shifted their headquarter from Delhi to
Allahabad.
Place Name of the leader
Allahabad Liyaqat Ali
Mathura Devi Singh
Meerut Kadam Singh
Faizabd Maulvi Mohammed ullah
Bareilly Khan Bahadur Khan
Haryana Rao Tula Ram
Banda Nawab Ali Bahadur
Auwa, Marwar (Raj) Kushal Singh
 Bahadur Shah Zafar – exiled to Rangoon
 Nana Saheb – escaped to Nepal
 Begum Hazrat Mahal – escaped to Nepal
 Tania Tope – Captured and hanged
 Rani Laxmi Bai – Martyred on battlefield

 Weaknesses of the Revolt and its Suppression
 The revolt could not embrace the entire country or all the groups and
classes of Indian society.
 It did not spread to South India and most of Eastern and Western India
 The Scindia of Gwalior, the Holkar of Indore, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the
Raja of Jodhpur and other Rajput rulers, the Nawab of Bhopal, the rulers
of Patiala Nabha, Maharaja of Kashmir, the Ranas of Nepal and a large
number of big Zamindars gave active support to British.
 The modern educated Indians also did not support the revolt
because of the backward outlook of the revolt.
 The rebels were short of modern weapons and other materials of
war.
 They were poorly organized. There was lack of unity and
coordination.
 Lack of planning and funds
 Absence of feeling of Nationalism among the masses.
 The better communication technology available to British enabling
quick reinforcements
 The rebels were dealt with an early blow when the British captured
Delhi on 20 September, 1857 after prolonged and bitter fighting.
 With the fall of Delhi, the focal point of the revolt disappeared.
 By the end of 1859, British authority over India was fully reestablished.
 Asbab e Bagawat e Hind – book by Sir Syed Ahmed khan in
Urdu ,written in 1859
 Describes the revolt
 Benjamin Disraeli – ‘’A national rising ’’
 Savarkar - ‘’ First war of Independence’’
 JN Nehru - ‘’A feudal outburst led by feudal chiefs’’
 Sir John Lawrence - ‘’A sepoy Mutiny’’
 TR Holmes – ‘’ Conflict between civilization and Barbarism ‘’
 The revolt did began as a sepoy mutiny
 It was indeed led by feudal chiefs in most places
 The large geo physical extension points to proto nationalistic feelings in the
people
 It was supported by common people in large parts of Awadh and Punjab

Rise of Left
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Reasons for Emergence of Left-wing
The following are the reasons for the emergence of the left-wing within the congress in late
British Era-
• There was a group of young leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Bose who were
influenced by the outside world and with the ideological developments there.
• Socialist ideas acquired roots in the Indian soil and socialism became the accepted
creed of Indian youth.
• Impact of the Russian Revolution, wherein Lenin overthrew the despotic Czarist regime
and declared the formation of the first socialist state.
• Several socialist and communist groups came into existence all over the country.
• Various publication woks such as S.A. Dange’s Gandhi and Lenin, Muzaffar
Ahmed’s Navayug, Ghulam Hussain’s Inquilab and M. Singaravelu’s Labour-Kisan
Gazette.
• Most importantly was the ideological difference between the radical group and
rest of congress.
• The rightist believed in the method of prayers and petition with no direct attack
on the British.
• The Left-Wing on the other hand believed in direct attack and wanted
independence at the earliest.
• There was definitely a positive impact due to the Left-Wing rise within congress
on the programmes and policies of congress.
Some of the positives were-
• Emergence of All India Trade Union Congress and Workers and Peasants
Party.
• Equal importance to social and economic freedom on the lines of political
freedom.
• Due to the leftist influence, the leaders within congress were able to take
critical stands on various occasions such as Karachi Resolution, Economic
Policy resolution at Faizpur Session, 1936 political manifesto of Congress
and National Planning Committee in 1938.
Emergence of Communist Party in India
• The Russian Revolution of 1917 had a great impact on the minds of the Indian People.
• So naturally when the Non cooperation movement turned out to be a failure, they were
dissatisfied. The image of Gandhi was also tarnished.
• One of the members of the Anushilan –Manabendra Nath Roy was very much influenced by the
communist thoughts.
• His original name was Narendra Nath Bhattacharya and in 1907, when he was a young man of 20
years had conducted a political dacoity, to raise money for Anushilan. He was arrested but was
defended by J N Roy and was released.
• After that he reached California and then married a Californian girl and settled in New York.
• In New York he studied Marxism and fled to Mexico and from there he developed contacts with
the Germans.
• In 1930 he came to Bombay and was arrested in 1931 and sent to jail for 6 years.
• On 20 October 1920, he had been in Russia to attend the second congress of
communist international.
• Thus, the communist party of India was launched in Tashkent in October 1920.
• At the same time, an Berlin group was launched by Virendranath
Chattophadhyaya, Bhupendra Dutt et al.
• For the next five years, various Communist groups were launched in various parts
of India.
• It was in December 1925, when Satyabhakta organized these small organizations
into one All India Conference of the Communists at Kanpur.
• The present of the All India Conference of Communists was Singarvelu Chettiar
from the Madras Province.
• The government, however, did not favour the activities of the Communists in India and on
23rd July, 1934 it imposed a ban on the functioning of the party.
• The Communists now tried to infiltrate in the Congress and some of them pleaded for
constituting a united front of all leftist forces so that a solid fight could be put against British
empire.
• They did not favourably view constitutional scheme embodied under the Government of
India Act, 1935. They were opposed to Federal pattern for India and also scheme of
provincial autonomy.
• The Communists had all along been condemning British government as an imperialist and
capitalist power which was exploiting the poor Indians. They wanted that the aim of India’s
freedom struggle should be that of throwing Britishers out of India. But when Soviet Russia
joined Second World war on the sides of the Allies, the war became all of a sudden people’s
war.
• They appealed to the people of India to extend whole-hearted support to Britain
in war efforts.
• This completely alienated the sympathies of the people of India for the
Communists of India.
• They thus went out of main stream of national struggled.
• They also got a serious push out when they declared Subhash Chandra Bose as
traitor and openly condemned Gandhian philosophy, particularly his policies of
Satyagrah and Ahimsa.
• Thus, the party could not leave much impact during the difficult days when the
country was fighting for winning freedom.
Rise of Congress Socialist Party: 1934 Onwards
• Congress Socialist Party, or (CSP), was a left-wing group within the Congress.
• It was formed with Acharya Narendra Deva as President and Jay Prakash Narayan
as General Secretary in 1934.
• The rise of this party was due to the increased left influence in the Indian National
Congress.
• By 1935, one third of the Congress members were Congress Socialists. These
leaders rejected the idea of Gandhi (which they saw as anti-rational).
• Though, they remained active in the workers and peasants movement, they
rejected the sectarian attitude of the Communist Party of India.
• They were influenced by Marxism-Leninism. The ideal of this party was
decentralized socialism in which a substantial share in the economic power of cooperatives, trade unions, independent farmers, and local authorities.
Rise of Congress Socialist Party: 1934 Onwards
• J P Narayan was lodged in the Nasik Jail in 1932 for civil disobedience against
British rule. Here he met with Ram Manohar Lohia, Minoo Masani, Achyut
Patwardhan, Ashok Mehta, Yusuf Desai and other national leaders.
• After his release in 1934, JP Narayan convened a meeting in Patna which
founded the Bihar Congress Socialist Party with Narayan as general secretary
and Acharya Narendra Deva as president.
• The greeting “Comrade” was used in the new party.
• Masani mobilized the party in Bombay, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya and
Puroshottam Trikamdas organized the party in other parts of Maharashtra.
Rise of Congress Socialist Party: 1934 Onwards
• Many communists joined the CSP, it adopted Marxism in 1936. They had a
conference on the sidelines of the Faizpur Conference and then propounded a
doctrine that was aimed to transform the Indian National Congress into an antiimperialist front.
• Thus, emergence of the CSP had a long lasting impact on the politics of the
Congress for many years to come.
• They did not support the ideas of the Congress to extend conditional support to
the British Government during the Second World War. They argued that
independence could be achieved only by the direct struggle of the masses and
the war provided a golden opportunity for the same.
• They started mass revolutionary activities and it considerably increased during
the Quit India Movement.

Rise of Congress Socialist Party: 1934 Onwards
• They did not favour Congress and Muslim League accord on Pakistan.
• Though the Congress Socialist Party was not able to have its own way on
many important issues but it succeeded in giving radical orientation to the
congress policies in certain respect.
• Yet, it was due to their efforts that the Indian National Congress decided
to adopt Socialist pattern of society after independence.

RIVER LANDFORMS
By Dr Vipan Goyal

RIVER LANDFORMS
• Geomorphic agents – running water and groundwater, which
causes erosion and deposition.
• They form various erosional (destructional) and depositional
(constructional) landforms.
• There are some other independent controls like (i) stability of sea
level; (ii) tectonic stability of landmass; (iii) climate etc. which
influence the evolution of these landforms.
• The landforms created as a result of degradational action
(erosion) or aggradational work (deposition) of running water are
called fluvial landforms.
What does Running Water do?
• Running water has two
components:
• one is overland flow on the general
land surface as a sheet and
• Other is linear flow as streams and
rivers in valleys.
• The overland flow causes sheet
erosion and depending upon the
irregularities of the land surface,
the overland flow may concentrate
into narrow to wide paths.
• During the sheet erosion, minor or major
quantities of materials from the surface of
the land are removed in the direction of
flow and gradual small and narrow rills will
form.
• These rills will gradually develop into long
and wide gullies, the gullies will further
deepen, widen and lengthen and unite to
give rise to a network of valleys.
• Once a valley is formed, it later develops
into a stream or river.
Fluvial Erosional Landforms
• River Valley Formation
 The extended depression on ground through
which a stream flows throughout its course is
called a river valley.
 At different stages of the erosional cycle the valley
acquires different profiles.
River course
Youth
Maturity
Old Age
Upper Course / Stage of Youth
(Erosion dominates):
• It starts from the source of the
river in hilly or mountainous areas.
• The river flows down the steep
slope and, as a result, its velocity
and eroding power are at their
maximum.
• As the river flows down with high
velocity, vertical erosion or
downward cutting will be high
which results in the formation of VShaped Valleys.
Middle Course/ Stage of Maturity
(Transportation dominates):
• In this stage, vertical erosion slowly starts
to replace with lateral erosion or erosion
from both sides of the channel.
• Thus, the river channel causes the gradual
disappearance of its V-shaped valley (not
completely).
• Streams are plenty at this stage with good
integration.
• Wider flood plains start to visible in this
course and the volume of water increases
with the confluence of many tributaries.
• Landforms like alluvial fans, piedmont
alluvial plains, meanders etc. can be seen
at this stage.
Lower Course/ Stage of Old
(Deposition dominates):
• At a river’s mouth sediment is deposited as
the velocity of the river slows.
• As the river becomes shallower more
deposition occurs, forming islands and
braiding the main channel into multiple,
narrower channels.
• As the sediment is laid down, the actual
mouth of the river moves away from the
source into the sea or lake, forming a delta.
• Landforms like braided channels, floodplains,
levees, meanders, oxbow lakes, deltas etc.
can be seen at this stage.
Stages of River
Various Aspects of Fluvial Erosive Action
 Abrasion: solid river load
striking against rocks and
wearing them down.
 Hydration: force of
running water wearing
down rocks.
 Attrition: river load
particles striking, colliding
against each other and
breaking down in the
process.
Various Aspects of Fluvial Erosive Action
 Down-cutting: Erosion
in vertical direction
(down-cutting leads to
valley deepening) or
 Lateral erosion: Erosion
in horizontal direction,
especially the walls of
the stream.
Various Aspects of Fluvial
Transportaion Types
• After erosion, the eroded materials get transported with
the running water. This transportation of eroded materials
is carried in four ways:
• Traction: The heavier and larger rock fragments like
gravels, pebbles etc are forced by the flow of the river to
roll along its bed. These fragments can be seen rolling,
slipping, bumping and being dragged. This process is called
as traction and the load transported in this way are called
traction load.
• Saltation: Some of the fragments of the rocks move along
the bed of a stream by jumping or bouncing continuously.
This process is called as saltation.
• Suspension: The holding up of small particles of sand, silt
and mud by the water as the stream flows is called
suspension.
• Solution: Some parts of the rock fragments dissolved in
the river water and transported. This type of
transportation is called solution transportation.
• When the stream comes down from the hills to plain areas with the
eroded and transported materials, the absence of slope/gradient
causes the river to lose it energy to further carry those transported
materials.
• As a result, the load of the river starts to settle down which is
termed as deposition.
• Erosion, transportation, and deposition continue until the slopes
are almost completely flattened
Erosional Landforms :Waterfalls
• A waterfall is simply the fall of an enormous
volume of water from a great height.
• They are mostly seen in youth stage of river.
• Relative resistance of rocks, relative difference
in topographic reliefs, fall in the sea level and
related rejuvenation, earth movements etc. are
responsible for the formation of waterfalls.
• For example, Jog or Gersoppa falls on
Sharavati River.
Rills and Gulleys
• Gulley is an incised water-worn channel,
which is particularly common in semi-arid
areas.
• It is formed when water from overlandflows down a slope, especially following
heavy rainfall, is concentrated into rills,
which merge and enlarge into a gulley.
• The ravines of Chambal Valley in Central
India and the Chos of Hoshiarpur in Punjab
are examples of gulleys.
Erosional Landforms :Valleys, Gorges, Canyon
• Valleys are formed as a result of running
water.
• The rills which are formed by the overland
flow of water later develop into gullies.
• These gullies gradually deepen and widen
to form valleys.
• A gorge is a deep valley with very steep to
straight sides.
• A canyon is characterized by steep step-like
side slopes and may be as deep as a gorge.
• A gorge is almost equal in width at its top
as well as bottom and is formed in hard
rocks while a canyon is wider at its top
than at its bottom and is formed in
horizontal bedded sedimentary rocks.
Pot Holes
• Potholes are more or less circular
depressions over the rocky beds of
hills streams which are usually
cylindrical in shape.
• Potholing or pothole-drilling is the
mechanism through which the
grinding tools (fragments of rocks, e.g.
boulders and angular rock fragments)
when caught in the water eddies or
swirling water start dancing in a
circular manner and grind and drill
the rock beds of the valleys like a
drilling machine.
Plunge pools
• Plunge pools are nothing
but large, deep potholes
commonly found at the
foot of a waterfall.
• They are formed because
of the sheer impact of
water and rotation of
boulders.
River Terraces
• They are surfaces marking old valley floor or flood plains.
• They are basically the result of vertical erosion by the stream.
• Stepped benches along the river course in a flood plain are
called terraces.
• Terraces represent the level of former valley floors and
remnants of former (older) flood plains.
• When the terraces are of the same elevation on either side of
the river, they are called as paired terraces.
• When the terraces are seen only on one side with none on the
other or one at quite a different elevation on the other side,
they are called as unpaired terraces.
Fluvial Depositional Landforms
• The decrease in stream velocity reduces the transporting power of
the streams which are forced to leave some load to settle down.
• Increase in river load is effected through accelerated rate of erosion
in the source catchment areas consequent upon deforestation.
• Various landforms resulting from fluvial deposition are as follows:
Alluvial Fans and Cones
• When a stream leaves the mountains and
comes down to the plains, its velocity
decreases due to a lower gradient.
• As a result, it sheds a lot of material, which
it had been carrying from the mountains, at
the foothills.
• This deposited material acquires a conical
shape and appears as a series of continuous
fans. These are called alluvial fans.
• Such fans appear throughout the Himalayan
foothills in the north Indian plains.
Delta
• Deltas are like an alluvial fan but develop at
a different location.
• They are found in the mouth of the river,
which is the final location of depositional
activity of a river.
• The river gets divided into distributaries
which may further divide and rejoin to form
a network of channels.
• The coarser material settle out first and the
finer materials like silt and clay are carried
out into the sea.
• Depending on the conditions under which
they are formed, deltas can be of many
types.
Arcuate or Fan-shaped
• This type of delta results
when light depositions
give rise to shallow,
shifting distributaries
and a general fan-shaped
profile. Examples: Nile,
Ganga, Indus.
Bird’s Foot Delta
• This type of delta emerges when
limestone sediment deposits do not
allow downward seepage of water.
• The distributaries seem to be flowing
over projections of these deposits
which appear as a bird’s foot.
• The currents and tides are weak in
such areas and the number of
distributaries lesser as compared to an
arcuate delta. Example: Mississippi
river.
Cuspate Delta
• This is a pointed delta
formed generally along
strong coasts and is
subjected to strong wave
action. There are very few or
no distributaries in a cuspate
delta.
• Example: Tiber river on west
coast of Italy.
Natural Levees
• These are narrow ridges of low
height on both sides of a river,
formed due to deposition action of
the stream, appearing as natural
embankments.
• These act as a natural protection
against floods but a breach in a
levee causes sudden floods in
adjoining areas, as it happens in the
case of the Hwang Ho river of
China.
Incised or Entrenched Meanders
• They are very deep wide meanders (loop-like
channels) found cut in hard rocks.
• In the course of time, they deepen and widen to
form gorges or canyons in hard rock.
• The difference between a normal meander and an
incised/entrenched meander is that the latter found
on hard rocks.
• The outer bend of the loop in a meander is
characterized by intensive erosion and vertical cliffs
and is called the cliff-slope side. This side has a
concave slope.
• The inner side of the loop is characterized by
deposition, a gentle convex slope, and is called
the slip-off side.
Ox-Bow Lake
• Sometimes, because of intensive erosion action, the
outer curve of a meander gets accentuated to such an
extent that the inner ends of the loop come close
enough to get disconnected from the main channel
and exist as independent water bodies. These water
bodies are converted into swamps in due course of
time.
• In the Indo-Gangetic plains, southwards shifting of
Ganga has left many ox-bow lakes to the north of the
present course of the Ganga.
Braided Channels
• When selective deposition of
coarser materials causes the
formation of a central bar, it
diverts the flow of river
towards the banks, which
increases lateral erosion.
• Similarly, when more and more
such central bars are formed,
braided channels are formed.
• Riverine Islands are the result
of braided channels.

Rocks
By Dr Vipan Goyal

ROCKS
 Any aggregate of material particles that forms the earth crust is called Rock.
 The scientific study of rocks is called petrology, which is an essential
component of geology..
 Feldspar and quartz are the most common minerals found in rocks.
• Rocks are of three types
 Igneous Rocks — solidified from magma and lava.
 Sedimentary Rocks — the result of deposition of fragments of rocks or the
weathered remains of igneous rocks.
 Metamorphic Rocks — formed out of existing rocks undergoing recrystallization
due to great pressure, high temperature and other chemical activities.

Igneous Rocks
• Formed out of solidification of molten magma and lava from the interior
of the earth and are known as primary rocks.
• If molten material is cooled slowly at great depths, mineral grains may be
very large and if there is sudden cooling (at the surface) results in small
and smooth grains.
• Most abundant of the three types. (95%)
• Granite, gabbro, pegmatite, basalt, etc. are some of the examples of
igneous rocks.
• These do not occur in layers.
• Most of them are crystalline and do not contain fossils.
Igneous Rocks
• All other type of rocks originate from these rocks, thus called Primary Rocks.
• Most igneous rocks are extremely hard & resistant hence are quarried for road
making & polished as monuments & grave stones.
• Can be divided on the basis of mineral composition
• Basic rocks contain high proportion of basic oxides mainly of iron, aluminium &
magnesium
• When they contain high proportion of silica they are said to be acidic, which are
less dense & lighter in color than basic rocks for ex. Granite
• There are two types of igneous rocks on the basis of mode of occurrence :
• Intrusive rocks (Granite) and Extrusive rocks (Basalt-Deccan Traps).
1. On the basis of Mode of Occurrence :
• a)Intrusive Igneous rocks or Granite : They are formed by the
solidification of magma beneath the earth’s surface.
• They are further divided into Plutonic and Hypabyssal igneous Rocks.
• b) Lava or Volcanic Rocks or Extrusive rocks : They are formed by the
solidification of magma at the earth’s surface.
Intrusive Igneous rocks : Plutonic Rocks
• Plutonic : Sometimes, the molten
matter is not able to reach the
surface and instead cools down
very slowly at great depths.
• Slow cooling allows big-sized
crystals (large grains) to be
formed.
• Granite, Diorite, Gabbro is a
typical example. These rocks
appear on the surface only after
being uplifted and denuded.
Intrusive Igneous rocks : Hypabyssal
or Dyke Rocks or Intermediate rocks
• These rocks occupy an intermediate
position between the deep-seated
plutonic bodies and the surface lava
flows. Or we can say it cools just
beneath the earth’s surface.
• Example : Batholith, Laccolith,
Phacolith, Sills, Dykes
• Dyke rocks are semi-crystalline in
structure.
Extrusive rocks : Lava or Volcanic Rocks
• These are formed by rapid cooling of the lava
thrown out during volcanic eruptions.
• Rapid cooling prevents crystallization, as a result
such rocks are fine-grained.
• Basalt is a typical example. The Deccan traps in
the peninsular region is of basaltic origin. (which
yield Regur or black soil)
• Basic rocks contain a greater proportion of basic
oxides, e.g. of iron, aluminium or magnesium,
and are thus denser and darker in colour.
• Examples : Basalt, Gabbro
2. On the basis of Silica Content
• Based on the presence of acid forming radical, silicon, igneous rocks are
divided into Acid Rocks and Basic Rocks.
• Acidic Rocks
• These are characterized by high content of silica—up to 80 per cent, while
the rest is divided among aluminium, alkalis, magnesium, iron oxide, lime
etc..
• Due to the excess of silicon, acidic magma cools fast and it does not flow
and spread far away.
• These rocks constitute the sial portion of the crust.
• High mountains are
formed of this type of
rock.
• Acid rocks are hard,
compact, massive and
resistant to weathering.
• Example : Granite and
Rhyolite
Basic Rocks
• These rocks are poor in silica (about
40 per cent) and more of Ferromagnetism
• Parent material of such rocks cools
slowly and thus, flows and spreads far
away and give rise to plateaus.
• Presence of heavy elements imparts
to these rocks a dark colour.
• Not being very hard, these rocks are
weathered relatively easily.
• Example : Basalt, Gabbro and Dolerite.

Sedimentary Rocks/ Detrital rocks
• Formed as a result of denudation (weathering and erosion) of Igneous Rocks.
• These deposits through compaction turn into rocks. This process is
called lithification.
• Formed due to deposition of layers of sediment usually along the water bodies
over a long period of time
• Comprise only about 5% of the earth’s crust but cover about 75 per cent of the
total land surface.
• The layers of sedimentary rocks holds all the reserves of coal, oil and natural gas.
• Also known as Stratified Rocks because of the layers. Example: sandstone, shale
etc.
Sedimentary Rocks
• Rocks may be fine grained or coarse, soft
or hard & material forming them may be
brought by streams, glaciers, winds or
even animals.
• They are non-crystalline & often
contains fossils
Sedimentary Rocks Classification
• Mechanically formed —
sandstone, conglomerate,
limestone, shale, loess etc.
• Organically formed —
geyserite, chalk, limestone,
coal etc.
• Chemically formed —
gypsum, salt rock, halite,
potash etc..
Mechanically Formed Sedimentary Rocks
• Formed by mechanical agents like running
water, wind, ocean currents, ice and break
down the pre-existing rocks (so called Clastic
Sedimentary Rocks).
• Made from sand grains with tremendously
varying texture, composition & colour. For ex :
Sandstone
• Mainly quarried for building purposes or for
making grindstones
• Finer sedimentary materials form clay, widely
used for making bricks, shale or mudstone.
• Sand & gravel may occur in uncemented form
Chemically Formed Sedimentary Rocks
• Formed chemically from solutions of one
another.
• E.g. Gypsum, (Calcium sulphate) is obtained
from evaporation of salt lakes having high
salinity
• Salt Rock, Potash and Nitrate etc. are
examples.
Organically Formed Sedimentary Rocks
• The remains of plants and animals are
buried under sediments and due to heat
and pressure from overlying layers, their
composition undergoes a change.
• Formed from Plant remains ( e.g. Peat,
Lignite, Bituminous Coal ) or animals ( chalk
and coral ).
• Formed from the remains of living
organisms such as corals or shellfish, whose
fleshy part has been decomposed, leaving
behind the hard cells.
Organically Formed Sedimentary Rocks
• Most common rocks formed
due to this process are
Carbonaceous rocks are also
organically formed but from
vegetative matter –coal and
forests
• Calcareous type for ex.
Limestone, dolomite &
Chalk
Spread of Sedimentary Rocks in India
• Alluvial deposits in the Indo-Gangetic plain and coastal plains
• Sandstones are spread over Madhya Pradesh, eastern Rajasthan, parts of
Himalayas, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa.
• The great Vindhyan highland in central India consists of sandstones,
shales, limestones.
• Coal deposits occur in river basins of the Damodar, Mahanadi, Godavari in
the Gondwana sedimentary deposits.
Metamorphic Rocks
• The word metamorphic means ‘change of form’.
• Metamorphism is a process by which already consolidated rocks
undergo recrystallization and reorganization of materials within
original rocks.
• Formed due to the action of pressure, volume and temperature or
action of water and chemical activity.
• Contains no fossils
Metamorphic Rocks
• Sometimes minerals or materials of
different groups are arranged into
alternating thin to thick layers. Such a
structure in is called banding.
• In the process of metamorphism in
some rocks grains or minerals get
arranged in layers or lines. Such an
arrangement is called foliation or
lineation.
Some examples of Metamorphosis
Igneous or Sedimentary rock Influence Metamorphosed rock
Granite Pressure Gneiss
Clay, Shale Pressure Schist
Sandstone Heat Quartzite
Shale Heat Phyllite
Coal (Anthracite) Heat Graphite
Limestone Heat Marble


Rock Cycle : continuous process through which
old rocks are transformed into new ones.

 Round Table Conferences (1930–32) were a series of meetings in three
sessions called by the British government to consider the
future constitution of India.
 The conference resulted from a review of the Government of India
Act of 1919, undertaken in 1927 by the Simon Commission, whose
report was published in 1930.
 The conference was held in London.
 The result of these deliberations was the Government of India Act,
1935, establishing provincial autonomy and also a federal system that
was never implemented.

First Round Table Conference
(November 1930 – January 1931)
 This was the first ever conference arranged between the British and the
Indians as equals. (Round Table)
 Chaired by British PM Ramsay MacDonald
 Congress and most business leaders boycotted the First RTC
 Who attended?
Muslim League
Hindu Mahasabha
Liberals
Princes/Princely States
 16 delegates represented the three political parties of Britain
 57 political leaders from India representing all shades of Indian
opinion, minus Indian National Congress.
 Muslim League: Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Shafi, Aga
Khan, Muhammad Ali, Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, A.K. Fazlul Huq
 Hindu Mahasabha: B. S. Moonje and M.R. Jayakar
 Indian Liberal Party : Tej Bahadur Sapru, C. Y. Chintamani and
Srinivasa Sashtri
 Sikhs: Sardar Ujwal Singh
 The ‘Untouchables’/Depressed classes: B. R. Ambedkar
 Virtually every delegate reiterated that a constitutional discussion to
which the Congress was not a party was meaningless.

 ‘’A wedding procession without the Groom’’
 Ambedkar demanded separate electorates for Depressed class(SC/ST)
First RTC = Failure /No result/No outcome
Gandhi – Irwin Pact/ Delhi Pact 1931
•On January 25, 1931 Gandhi and all other members of the CWC
were released from prison unconditionally.
•The congress working committee authorised Gandhi to initiate
discussions with the viceroy
•On 8 March 1931 the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed after
discussions
Irwin agreed on –
 Immediate release of all political prisoners not convicted of violence
 Remission of all fines not yet collected
 Return of all lands not yet sold to third parties
 Lenient treatment to those government servants who had resigned
 Right to make salt in coastal villages for personal consumption (not for
sale)
 Right to peaceful and non-aggressive picketing;
 Withdrawal of emergency ordinances.
The viceroy, however, turned down two of Gandhi’s demands—
 Public inquiry into police excesses
 Commutation of Bhagat Singh and his comrades’ death sentence to life
sentence
Gandhi on behalf of the Congress agreed—
 to suspend the civil disobedience movement
 to participate in the next RTC
Karachi Congress Session, 1931
 In March 1931, a special session of the Congress was held at Karachi to
endorse the Gandhi-Irwin or Delhi Pact.
 Presided by - IRON MAN Sardar V.B.Patel
 Two resolutions were adopted which made the session memorable -
 one on Fundamental Rights
 the other on National Economic Programme
 Resolutions passed on –Fundamental rights ,universal franchise,
education, freedom of speech, press and economic policy
 This was the first time the Congress spelt out what Swaraj would mean for
the masses.
 The Karachi Resolution formed the basic political and economic platform
of the Congress in later years.
Second Round Table Conference
(September - December 1931)
 Congress had agreed to attend the 2nd RTC under the Delhi Pact
 Mahatma Gandhi participated in the Conference as the sole representative of the
INC but accompanied by Sarojini Naidu and also Madan Mohan Malaviya
 Gandhi claimed that the Congress alone represented political India; that the
Untouchables were Hindus and should not be treated as a “minority”; and that
there should be no separate electorates or special safeguards for Muslims or other
minorities.
 These claims were rejected by the other Indian participants – Dr. Bhimrao Ramji
Ambedkar
 No agreement could be reached on the demand of complete independence and on
the communal question – Gandhiji had to return to India disappointed
 1932 January - the Civil-Disobedience Movement was resumed as soon
as Gandhiji left London
 Government arrested Mahatma Gandhi on arrival in India
 Sardar Patel was also arrested
 Govt. re-imposed the ban on the Congress party
Communal Award /MacDonald Award
 The Communal Award was announced by the British Prime Minister,
Ramsay MacDonald, on 16 August 1932.
 This was yet another expression of British policy of divide and rule.
 The Muslims, Sikhs and Christians had already been recognised as
minorities.
 The Communal Award declared the depressed classes also to be
minorities, and entitled them to separate electorates.
Gandhi’s Reaction to Communal Awards
 The effort to separate the depressed classes from the rest of the Hindus by
treating them as separate political entity was vehemently opposed by all
the nationalists.
 Gandhi saw the Communal Award as an attack on Indian unity and
nationalism.
 Once the depressed classes were treated as a separate political entity, he
argued, the struggle for abolishing untouchability would get undermined
 He said that separate electorates would ensure that the untouchables
remained untouchables in perpetuity
 He went on a fast until death in Yerwada jail, Poona to protest the award
Poona Pact
On 24th of September, 1932, an agreement was reached between Dr Ambedkar and
Gandhi, Known as the Poona Pact
Terms :

Salient features of the Constitution
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal ©StudyIQ Education

Introduction
• The Indian Constitution, though borrowed from almost every
constitution of the world, the constitution of India has several salient
features that distinguish it from the constitutions of other countries.
• A number of original features of the Constitution (as adopted in 1949)
have undergone a substantial change, on account of several
amendments, particularly 7th, 42nd, 44th, 73rd and 74th
Amendments. In fact, the 42nd Amendment Act (1976) is known as
‘Mini-Constitution’.
©StudyIQ Education
Salient features of the Constitution
Features:
1. Lengthiest Written Constitution:
• The Constitution of India is the lengthiest of all the written
constitutions of the world. It is a very comprehensive, elaborate and
detailed document.
• Originally (1949), the Constitution contained a Preamble, 395 Articles
(divided into 22 Parts) and 8 Schedules.
• Presently, it consists of a Preamble, 465 Articles (divided into 25
Parts) and 12 Schedules.
©StudyIQ Education
2. Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility
• A rigid Constitution is one that requires a special procedure for its
amendment, as for example, the American Constitution. A flexible
constitution, on the other hand, is one that can be amended in the same
manner as the ordinary laws are made, as for example, the British
Constitution.
• The Constitution of India is neither rigid nor flexible but a synthesis of both.
Article 368 provides for two types of amendments:
(a)Some provisions can be amended by a special majority of the
Parliament, i.e., a two-third majority of the members of each House
present and voting, and a majority (that is, more than 50 per cent), of
the total membership of each House.
©StudyIQ Education
(b)Some other provisions can be amended by a special majority of the
Parliament and with the ratification by half of the total states.
*Note: At the same time, some provisions of the Constitution can be amended by
a simple majority of the Parliament in the manner of ordinary legislative process.
Notably, these amendments do not come under Article 368.

Features of a federation in Indian
Constitution
• two government,
• division of powers, written
Constitution,
• supremacy of Constitution,
• rigidity of Constitution,
• independent judiciary
• Bicameralism, etc.
Unitary/Non Federal features in the
Indian Constitution
• a strong Centre,
• single Constitution,
• single citizenship,
• flexibility of Constitution,
• integrated judiciary,
• all-India services,
• emergency provisions, etc.
©StudyIQ Education
3. Federal System with Unitary Bias
*Note:
1. the term ‘Federation’ has nowhere been used in the Constitution.
Article 1, on the other hand, describes India as a ‘Union of States’
which implies two things: one, Indian Federation is not the result of
an agreement by the states; and two, no state has the right to
secede from the federation.
2. ‘quasi-federal’ by K C Wheare,
3. ‘bargaining federalism’ by Morris Jones,
4. ‘co-operative federalism’ by Granville Austin,
5. ‘federation with a centralizing tendency’ by Ivor Jennings, and so on.
©StudyIQ Education
4. Parliamentary Form of Government
• The parliamentary system is based on the principle of cooperation
and co-ordination between the legislative and executive organs
• The presidential system is based on the doctrine of separation of
powers between the two organs.
• The features of parliamentary government in India are:
(a)Presence of nominal and real executives;
(b)Majority party rule,
(c)Collective responsibility of the executive to the legislature,
(d)Membership of the ministers in the legislature,
(e)Leadership of the prime minister or the chief minister,
(f)Dissolution of the lower House (Lok Sabha or Assembly).
©StudyIQ Education
*Note:
1. The parliamentary system is also known as the ‘Westminster’ model
of government, responsible government and cabinet government.
2. Indian Parliamentary System is largely based on the British pattern,
however, there are some fundamental differences between the two:
• the Indian Parliament is not a sovereign body like the British Parliament.
• Further, the Indian State has an elected head (republic) while the British
State has hereditary head (monarchy).
©StudyIQ Education
5. Synthesis of Parliamentary Sovereignty and Judicial Supremacy
• The framers of the Indian Constitution have preferred a proper
synthesis between the British principle of parliamentary sovereignty
and the American principle of judicial supremacy.
• The Supreme Court, on the one hand, can declare the parliamentary
laws as unconstitutional through its power of judicial review. The
Parliament, on the other hand, can amend the major portion of the
Constitution through its constituent power.
©StudyIQ Education
6. Integrated and Independent Judiciary Polity.
The Indian Constitution establishes a judicial system that is integrated as
well as independent.
• The Supreme Court stands at the top of the ‘integrated’ judicial
system in the country:
• Below it, there are high courts at the state level.
• Under a high court, there is a hierarchy of subordinate courts, that is, district courts
and other lower courts.
• This single system of courts enforces both the central laws as well as the state laws
©StudyIQ Education
• the Constitution has made various provisions to ensure its independence:
• security of tenure of the judges,
• fixed service conditions for the judges,
• all the expenses of the Supreme Court charged on the Consolidated Fund of India,
• prohibition on discussion on the conduct of judges in the legislatures,
• ban on practice after retirement,
• power to punish for its contempt vested in the Supreme Court,
• separation of the judiciary from the executive

Sangam Age
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Sangam Age
• It is the period from the first century BCE to the end
of the second century CE in south India.
• There were 3 Sangams conducted in ancient South
India
• These Sangams prospered under the royal patronage
of the Pandya kings of Madurai.

legendary sages. No literary work of this Sangam is available. Chairman
was Augustya.
• The Second Sangam was held at Kapatapuram, only Tolkappiyam survives
from this. Chairman : Tolkappiyar
• The Third Sangam at Madurai was founded by Mudathirumaran. A few of
these Tamil literary works have survived and are a useful sources to
reconstruct the history of the Sangam period. Chairman : Nakkirar
Kurool or Muppal, a part of Patinenkilakanakku and written by Tiruvalluvar is
called Bible of Tamil Land or called fifth veda. It is a treatise on polity, ethics
and social norms.
Economy of the Sangam Age

common crop.
• The handicraft included weaving, metal works and carpentry, ship building
and making of ornaments using beads, stones and ivory.
• These were in great demand of all above products in the internal and
external trade as this was at its peak during the Sangam period.
Economy of the Sangam Age
• A high expertise was attained in spinning and weaving of cotton and silk
clothes. Various poems mention of cotton clothes as thin as a cloud of
steam or like a slough of snake.

Scalars and Vectors
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Physics and Physical Quantity
• Physics- It is scientific study of matter and energy and the effect
that they have on each other.
• Physical Quantity – Quantities expressed in terms of laws of physics
are called Physical Quantities.
• There are two types of Physical quantities. They are:
1. Scalars
2. Vectors
Physical Quantities
1. Scalars – The physical quantities which has only magnitude and
does not depend on direction is called Scalar quantities. For e.g.
length, volume, speed, mass, density, temperature etc.
2. Vectors – Vector quantities has both magnitude and direction. For
e.g. Displacement, velocity, Accelaration, Momentum etc.
NOTE: A physical quantity which has both magnitude and direction
but doesn’t obey vector law of addition or subtraction is not a vector
quantity. For e.g. Electric current, pressure, work
Scalars and Vectors
• SCALARS
 A scalar is a quantity that has magnitude only and has no
direction in space.
 Examples of scalar quantities: Length, Area, Volume , Time,
Mass
• VECTORS
 A vector quantity is a quantity that has both magnitude and a
direction in space.
 Example of vector quantities: Displacement, Velocity
Scalars and Vectors (examples)
• MASS
 It is the amount of ‘stuff’ – measured in kilograms. It is the
scalar quantity because it is fully described by a size. It is
measured in kg.
• WEIGHT
 It is the vector quantity because it has direction (the weight of
an object pushes down due to gravity). It is different at different
place. The object whose weight is w on earth, changes to w/6
on moon. Its unit is 1N or kgms-2.
Resultant of Two Vector Quantity
• Vectors in the same directions
 If two vectors in the same direction, add them together and
keep that direction.
• Vectors in opposite directions
 If two vectors are in the opposite direction, subtract them
together and keep that direction of the larger vector.
Motion of an object
• An object is in motion if it changes position relative to a reference
point.
• Objects that we call stationary- such as a tree, a sign, or a buildingmake good reference points
• DISTANCE
 When an object moves, it goes from point A to point B – that is
the distance it travelled.(SI unit is the meter).
Motion of an object
• DISPLACEMENT
 When distance has direction, it is called displacement. It is a
vector quantity with the unit as meter. It is also expressed in the
form of work done as the work is done when the force of 1N is
applied on the object and it is displaced by 1 meter.
• VELOCITY
 It is a description of an object’s speed with direction. It is a
vector quantity.
 Its unit is metre per second.
Difference Between Speed and Velocity
• 1. Speed is defined as the rate of change of distance and Velocity is
defined as the rate of change of displacement.
• 2. Speed is a scalar quantity and Velocity is a vector quantity.
• 3. Speed can never be negative or zero and Velocity can be
negative, zero or positive.
• 4. Speed is velocity without direction and Velocity is directed speed.
• 5. Speed may or may not be equal to velocity. A body may possess
different velocities but the same speed.
Difference Between Speed and Velocity
• 6. Speed never decreases with time. For a moving body, it is never
zero but Velocity can decrease with time. For a moving body , it can
be zero.
• 7. Speed in SI is measured in ms-1 and Velocity in SI, is measured
in ms-1
Acceleration
• It is the rate of change of velocity is called acceleration.
• Acceleration can result from a change in speed(increases or decreases), a
change in direction (back, forth, up, down left, right), or changes in both.
Like velocity, acceleration is a vector.
• Where v, is the final velocity and u is the initial velocity. The SI unit of
acceleration is m/s2.
• If the velocity is said to be in the positive direction, negative acceleration
would indicate that the object is slowing down. But if the velocity is said to
be in the negative direction, negative acceleration would indicate that the
object is speeding up.
Forces in the circle
• CENTRIPETAL FORCE
 A force that acts on a body moving in a circular path and is
directed towards the centre around which the body is moving.
 If you're in a spacecraft orbiting the earth, the centripetal force
is the force of gravity. If you drive a car in a circle, the centripetal
force is the force of friction between the road and the tires.
Forces in the circle
• CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
 Centripetal force is the inward-seeking pull of an object.
Centrifugal force is the opposite; it appears to pull objects away
from the center or axis of rotation. There are many applications
that exploit centripetal force.
 One is to simulate the acceleration of a space launch for
astronaut training.
 It is used in centrifugal separator in dairy industry to check the
amount of fat in the milk.
Temperature
• It is a scalar quantity.
• While temperatures may have negative values, they do not
represent a change in direction.
• A temperature reading at any point in time is a static figure.
Examples of Scalar and Vector Quantity
• Example of scalar quantities
 Mass
 Length
 Distance
 Speed
 Power
 Energy , work
 Temperature
 Pressure in gases
 volume
• Examples of vector quantities
 Weight
 Force
 Displacement
 Velocity
 Acceleration
 Thrust, Drag
 Momentum
 Pressure between solids
 Friction

SEA FLOOR SPREADING
and Plate Tectonics
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Convectional Current Theory
• Arthur Holmes in 1930s discussed the
possibility of convection currents in the
mantle.
• According to this theory, the intense
heat generated by radioactive
substances in the mantle (100-2900 km
below the earth surface) seeks a path to
escape, and gives rise to the formation
of convention currents in the mantle.
• Wherever rising limbs of these currents
meet, oceanic ridges are formed on the
sea floor and wherever the falling limbs
meet, trenches are formed.
Ocean floor mapping
• Oceanic crust not older
than mid- Mesozoic (
Pangea breakdown )
• Age increases away
from Mid ocean ridge (
volcano is there and
youngest rocks and after
that older rocks came)
• Sea amounts deformed
at trenches
Concept of Sea Floor Spreading
• The idea that the seafloor itself moves (and
carries the continents with it) as it expands from a
central axis was proposed by Harry Hess.
• According to this theory, the intense heat
generated by radioactive substances in the mantle
(100-2900 km below the earth surface) seeks a
path to escape, and gives rise to the formation of
convention currents in the mantle.
• Wherever rising limbs of these currents meet,
oceanic ridges are formed on the sea floor and
wherever the failing limbs meet, trenches are
formed.
Distribution of Mid Oceanic Ridge
Concept of Sea Floor Spreading
• Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at midocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed
through volcanic activity and then gradually moves
away from the ridge.
• Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in
the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates
diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in
the lithosphere.
Mid Oceanic Ridge- Trenches
• Basaltic magma rises up the fractures and
cools on the ocean floor to form new sea
floor.
• Older rocks will be found farther away
from the spreading zone while younger
rocks will be found nearer to the
spreading zone.
• At trench Ocean floor destroyed,
subducted and melted in mantle.
• Oceanic Crust heavier than continental
crust.
• Ocean floor acts like conveyor belt.
Evidences
1. Volcanic eruptions are common
all along the mid-oceanic ridges
and they bring huge amounts of
lava to the surface in this area.
2. The rocks equidistant on either
sides of the crest of mid-oceanic
ridges show remarkable
similarities
3. Rocks closer to the mid-oceanic
ridges are the youngest.
Evidences
4. The age of the rocks increases as one
moves away from the crest.
5. The deep trenches have deep-seated
earthquake occurrences while in the
mid-oceanic ridge areas, they have
shallow depths.
• It was on the basis of the continental drift
theory, theory of sea floor spreading, that
the theory of Plate Tectonics was
formulated—first outlined by Morgan in
1968.
Plate Tectonics
• In 1967, McKenzie and Parker suggested the theory of plate
tectonics. The theory was later outlined by Morgan in 1968.
• Both ‘convectional current theory’ and ‘see floor spreading’
paved the way for the Theory of Plate Tectonics.
Theory
• According to the theory of plate tectonics, the
earth’s lithosphere is broken into distinct
plates which are floating on a ductile
layer called asthenosphere (upper mantle). Plates
move horizontally over the asthenosphere as rigid
units.
• The lithosphere includes the crust and top
mantle with its thickness range varying between 5-
100 km in oceanic parts and about 200 km in the
continental areas.
• The oceanic plates contain mainly the Simatic
crust and are relatively thinner, while the continental
plates contain Sialic material and are relatively
thicker.
Major tectonic plates
1. Antarctic plate
2. North American
plate
3. South American
plate
4. Pacific plate
5. India-Australia
plate
6. African plate
7. Eurasian plate
Minor tectonic plates : formed due to stress
created by converging major plates.
1. Cocos plate: Between Central America and
Pacific plate
2. Nazca plate: Between South America and Pacific
plate
3. Arabian plate: Mostly the Saudi Arabian
landmass
4. Philippine plate: Between the Asiatic and Pacific
plate
5. Caroline plate: Between the Philippine and
Indian plate (North of New Guinea)
6. Fuji plate: North-east of Australia.
7. Turkish plate,
8. Aegean plate (Mediterranean region),
9. Caribbean plate,
10. Juan de Fuca plate (between Pacific and North
American plates)
11. Iranian plate
Force for the Plate Movement
• convection currents
as we see in the See
Floor Spreading
Plate Tectonics – Interaction of Plates
• There are three ways in which
the plates interact with each
other.
• Divergent plates
• Convergent plates
• Transform plates
Divergence forming Divergent
Edge or the Constructive Edge
• In this kind of interaction, the plates diverge
[move away from each other].
• In the Oceans, Mid-oceanic ridges are formed
due to this kind of interaction. Here, the
basaltic magma erupts and moves apart.
• On continents, Rift valley is formed
• Example :East African Rift Valley is the most
important geomorphological feature formed
due to divergence of African and Somali
plates.
Divergence forming Divergent
Edge or the Constructive Edge
• Such edges are sites of earth crust
formation (hence constructive) and
volcanic earth and Earthquakes are
common along such edges.
• Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the best-known
example of divergent boundaries
Convergence forming Convergent
Edge or Destructive Edge
• In this kind of interaction, two
lithospheric plates collide against
each other as a
result, trenches are formed at
the zone of subduction.
• The zone of collision may undergo
crumpling and folding and folded
mountains may emerge
• Example :Himalayan Boundary
Fault
Convergence forming Convergent
Edge or Destructive Edge
• There are mainly three ways in
which convergence can occur.
1. between an oceanic and
continental plate
2. between two oceanic plates
3. between two continental
plates
Transform plates/Conservative Edge/Transform Fault
• Formed when two plates move past each
other.
• In this kind of interaction, two plates grind
against each other and there is no creation
or destruction of landform but only
deformation of the existing landform.
• In oceans, transform faults are the planes
of separation generally perpendicular to
the mid oceanic ridges.
• San Andreas Fault
Evidence in Support of Plate Tectonics
• Evidences for both See Floor Spreading and Plate
tectonics are complimentary
• Older rocks form the continents while younger rocks
are present on the ocean floor.
• All plate boundary regions are areas of earthquake and
volcanic disturbances goes to prove the theory of plate
tectonics.
Significance of Plate Tectonics
• New minerals are thrown up from the core with
the magmatic eruptions.
• Economically valuable minerals like copper and
uranium are found more frequently near the
plate boundaries.
• Shape of landmasses in future can be guessed.

Simon Commission
• A seven-member Indian Statutory Commission, popularly known as the Simon
Commission (after the name of its chairman Sir John Simon) was appointed on 8 Nov.
1927.
• The commission was to recommend to the Government whether India was ready
for further constitutional reforms and on what lines
• What angered the Indians most was the exclusion of Indians from the
commission, Indians were against the appointment of an all-white commission
• The basic notion behind the exclusion was that foreigners would discuss and
decide upon India’s fitness for self-government

 The Congress session in Madras (December 1927) meeting under the
presidency of M A Ansari decided to boycott the commission “at every stage
and in every form”.
 The commission landed in Bombay on February 3, 1928.
 On that day, a countrywide hartal was organised and mass rallies held.
 Wherever the commission went, there were black flag demonstrations,
hartals and slogans of ‘Simon Go Back’.
 At Lahore, students took out a large anti-Simon Commission demonstration
on 30 October 1928 under the leadership of Lala Lajpat Rai. He was seriously
injured in the police Lathi charge and he passed away after few weeks.
 Report of the Simon Commission was published in May 1930
 It stated that the constitutional experiment with Diarchy was unsuccessful
 In its place the report recommended the establishment of autonomous
government
 This report also became the basis for enacting the Government of India
Act of 1935

Socio-religious Movements
in 19th century
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Causes of Socio-religious reforms
• Socio-religious reforms in the 19th century provided the soil
for growth of Indian Nationalism.
• The main reason of emergence of the reform movements was
spread of western education and liberal ideas.
• These reforms, as we all know started in Bengal and soon
spread in all parts of India.
• All demanded changes in society through social or education
reforms.
• The key areas of their focus included social issues such as
• Emancipation of women’s problems {Sati, female infanticide,
widow remarriage, women’s education etc.};
• questioning the casteism and untouchability;
• and religious issues such idolatry, polytheism, religious
superstitions and exploitation by priests.
Causes of Social Awakening
• The first and foremost reason was the British rule and its deep influence
on political, economic, social and culture life of India. It created conditions
favourable to intellectual growth.
• Second was the effort of the European Orientalists, whose efforts put
India’s glorious past into limelight.
• This includes work done by Sir William Jones, James Princep, Charles
Wilkins, Max Muller etc.
• Further, many Indian scholars such as Raja Rammohan Roy, Radhakanta
Deb, Rajendralal Mitra, MG Ranade etc. also contributed in reinterpreting
India’s past.
Causes of Social Awakening
• Third was the highly creative literature, marked by fusion of old and
new.
• Fourth was the detrimental effect of the Christian missionaries who
held that propaganda of Christianity in India would serve Britain’s
imperial interests; and would secure the empire. The Indians took it
as an onslaught on their religion and social customs. They wanted
to reform it so that evil social practices could be removed from
society.
Reformism versus Revivalism
• All the social awakening movements can be grouped into two schools viz.
Reformist and Revivalist.
• The colonial rule reflected that many of the Indian social practices and
institutions had become obsolete and they needed reforms and wanted to
inculcate the liberal ideas and education to reform the society. This was called
reformism.
• Reformists included the newly emerging western educated section of society in
India, who pioneered reform movements to bring about conclusive changes in
Indian society. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was one example.
• On the other hand the revivalism focussed on golden ancient period of India
and efforts to bring back the past glory.
Socio Religious Movements
• BRAHMO SAMAJ (Reformist) -
Raja Rammohan Roy:
 Known as the “father of the
Indian Renaissance”,
 In 1814, Rammohan Roy
settled in Calcutta and
dedicated his life to the cause
of social and religious reform.
Brahmo Samaj (Reformist) –
Raja Rammohan Roy
• As a social reformer, Rammohan Roy fought relentlessly against social evils like
sati, polygamy, child marriage, female infanticide and caste discrimination.
• He organised a movement against the inhuman custom of sati and helped
William Bentinck to pass a law banning the practice (1829).
• Rammohan Roy was one of the earliest propagators of modern Western
education. He looked upon it as a major instrument for the spread of modern
ideas in the country.
• He was associated with the foundation the Hindu College in Calcutta (which
later came to be known as the Presidency College). He also maintained at his
own cost an English school in Calcutta.
Journalism
• Rammohan Roy was a pioneer of Indian journalism.
• Samvad Kaumudi was the most important journal brought out
by him.
Religious Reforms
• Rammohan Roy struggled persistently against social evils.
• He argued that ancient Hindu texts the Vedas and the Upanishads upheld
the doctrine of monotheism. To prove his point, he translated the Vedas
and five Upanishads into Bengali.
• In 1849 he wrote Tuhfat-ul-Muwahhidin (Gift to Monotheists) in Persian.
• Rammohan Roy was a staunch believer in the philosophy of Vedanta
(Upanishads) and vigorously defended the Hindu religion and Hindu
philosophy from the attack of the missionaries.
Religious Reforms
• He was the founder of Atmiya Sabha in Calcutta in 1815 to propagate monotheism
and reform in the Hindu society.
• In 1828, Atmiya Sabha was named Brahmo Samaj.
• It believed in one universal God and prayer, meditation, reading from Upanishads
was used as a medium to worship God. There was no place for temple, rituals,
sacrifices, priest, etc. in the Samaj.
• He gave enthusiastic assistance to David Hare, who founded the famous Hindu
college in Calcutta.
• In 1830, Raja Ram Mohan Roy travelled to United Kingdom, as an ambassador of
Mughal Emperor Akbar II to ensure that the Lord Bentick’s regulation banning the
practice of Sati was not overturned. And got the Title Raja from Akbar II.
Religious Reforms
• He died at Stapleton, then a village to the north east of Bristol, on the Sept
27, 1833 of meningitis and was buried in Bristol.
• After the death of Raja Ram mohan roy, all were handled by
Debendranath Tagore.
Debendranath Tagore
• Debendranath Tagore, the father of
Rabindranath Tagore, was responsible for
revitalising the Brahmo Samaj.
• Under him the first step was taken to convert
the Brahmo Samaj into a separate religious
and social community.
• He represented the best in traditional Indian
learning and the new thought of the West.
Debendranath Tagore
• In 1839, he founded the Tatvabodhini Sabha in Calcutta to propagate
Rammohan Roy’s ideas.
• Debendranath Tagore supported the movements for widow remarriage,
the abolition of polygamy, women’s education and the improvement in
the condition of the peasantry.
Keshab Chandra Sen
• In 1857, Keshab Chandra Sen carried on an intensive
programme of social reform.
• He established Sangat Sabha while still in Brahmo
Samaj, to discuss the spiritual and social problems of
the contemporary society.
• In 1861, He established Indian Mirror, the first Indian
Daily in English.
• But gradually differences started arising between
Keshab and Debendranath Tagore.
• In 1865,Brahmo Samaj was divided into Adi Brahmo
Samaj (headed by Debendranath Tagore) and Brahmo
Samaj of India (headed by Keshab Chandra Sen).
• In 1872 the Government passed the Native (Civil) Marriages Act legalising
marriages performed according to Brahmo Samaj rites.
• In 1878, Sadaharna Brahmo Samaj was created out of Brahmo Samaj of India.
• The outlines of Sadaharna Brahmo Samaj were laid out by Anand Mohan Bose,
who were the ist president also.
• Shivnath Shastri, Bipin Chander Pal, Dwarikanath Ganguli and Surender Nath
Banerji were the prominent supporters of this outfit.
The Prarthana Samaj
• In 1867, the Prarthana Samaj was started in
Maharashtra with the aim of reforming
Hinduism and preaching the worship of one
God.
• Founded by Atmaram Pandurang with an aim
to make people believe in one God and
worship only one God.
• The members of Prarthana Samaj followed the religious traditions of
Maratha saints such as Namadev, Tukaram and Ramdas.
• Its activities spread to south India as a result of the efforts of Telegu social
reformer Veeresalingam Pantulu.
• Mahadev Govind Ranade and R.G. Bhandarkar were the two great leaders
of the Samaj.
• The Prarthana Samaj did in Maharashtra what the Brahmo Samaj did in
Bengal.
• In order to reform Hinduism, Ranade started the Widow
Remarriage Association and the Deccan Education Society.
• Ranade founded the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and
Ahmedanagar Education Society and later In 1887,
Ranade founded the National Social Conference with the
aim of introducing social reforms throughout the country.
• Ranade was also one of the founders of the Indian
National Congress Ranade attacked the caste system and
the predominance of the Brahmins, campaigned against
child marriage and the purdah system, preached widow
remarriage and emphasised female education.
ARYA SAMAJ (Revivalist)
• Founded in 1875 in Bombay by Swami Dayanand
Saraswati, (original name MoolShankar)
• He started the Suddhi Movement to bring back the
Hindu converted to other religions.
• He condemns idolatry, polytheism, Brahmin
sponsored religious rites and superstitious practices.
• He advocated social equality improvement in the
status of women and denounced untouchability, caste
rigidities and encouraged rationality.
• He disregarded authority of later Hindu scriptures like
Puranas.
• He published his views in his famous work Satyartha Prakash (the true
expositions in Hindi).
• He also wrote Veda-Bhasya Bhumika (partly in Hindi and partly in Sanskrit)
and Veda-Bhashya (in Sanskrit).
• He accepted the doctrine of karma, but rejected the theory of Niyati (fatalism).
He was the first man to advocate the concept of Swaraj.
• He propagated the motto “Back to the Vedas.”
• After his death, his followers had established the Dayanand Anglo Vedic Schools
first in Lahore and then in other parts of India.
• Gurukuls were also established to propagate traditional ideals of education.
• The Arya Samaj influenced mostly the people of northern India, specially
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab.
• Although it was not a political organisation, the Arya Samaj played a
positive role in creating a nationalist pride in Indian tradition and culture.
• Other Prominent persons of Arya Samaj were Lala Hans Raj, Pt. Guru Dutt,
Lala Laj Pat Rai, Swami Shraddanand.
Ramakrishna Mission
• Narendra Nath Dutta, better known as Swami
Vivekananda, was the most illustrious disciple of
Ramakrishna Paramahansa in 1892 in Belur near
Calcutta to promote the teachings of his Guru to
carry out humanitarian and social work.
• It opposed the caste system and untouchability. It
focused on the universality of all religions and
propagated Vedanta.
• After the death of Sri Ramakrishna, he became a
‘sanyasi’ and devoted his life to preaching and
spreading Ramakrishna’s message to the people.
• He had a deep understanding of Hindu philosophy and travelled far and wide to spread
its message. At the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago (1893), Vivekananda spoke
about Hindu religion at length
• And is perhaps best known for his speech which began, “ Sisters and Brothers of
America”.
• When Narendranath left Bombay for Chicago in 1893, a new name Vivekananda was
suggested for him by Ajit Singh of Khetri.
• American newspapers described him as an ‘Orator by Divine Right’.
• In 1895, he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble, an Irish woman who later came to be known
as Sister Nivedita.
• In 1896, his book Raja Yoga was published, which became an instant success and was
highly influential in the western understanding of Yoga.
• Vivekananda’s Birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day ( Jan 12)
• He published two papers : Prabhudha Bharat in English and Udbhodana in
Bengali.
Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa
• Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa was one of the
greatest saints of modern India.
• Ramakrishna was born in a poor Brahmin family
of Bengal.
• He was the chief priest of the Kali temple at
Dakshineswar near Calcutta.
• He believed that service to man was service to
God, As man was the creation of God, man-made
divisions made no sense to him.
Young Bengal Movement
• This movement was started by Henry Louis Vivian Derozio
in Calcutta in the 1820’s.
• Derozio was an Anglo-Indian college teacher in Calcutta and
he encouraged radical thinking among his students and
propagate the ideas of liberty, equality and fraternity.
• They condemned religious rites and the rituals, and pleaded
for eradication of social evils, female education and
improvement in the condition of women.
• Derozio was a poet, teacher, reformer and a fiery journalist.
He was perhaps the first nationalist poet of modern India.
• He also edited the papers, Herperus and Calcutta Literary
Gazette and was connected with India Gazette.
Veda Samaj
• Called Brahmo Samaj of South.
• Started by Sridharalu Naidu.
• He translated books of Brahmo Dharma into Tamil and Telegu
Dharma Sabha
• Initiated by Radhakant Deb in
1830.
• He opposed to reforms and
protected orthodoxy, but
played an active role in
promoting western education
even to girls.
Servants of India Society
• Formed by Gopal Krishna Gokhale in
1915.
• It did notable work in providing
famine relief and in improving the
conditions of tribal.
• Thakkar Bappa ( Amritlal VithalDas
Thakkar) was its member, who gave
the word Adivasi for tribals.
THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY
• Founded by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott in New York in
1875. In 1882 they shifted the headquarter at Adyar near Madras.
• It promoted the study of ancient Hindu, Buddhist and Zoroastrian
philosophies. It promoted the concept of universal brotherhood as
expounded in the Upanishads and Vedas.
• The society was greatly influenced by the Indian doctrine of karma.
• Annie Besant, an Irish woman who came to India in 1893, helped
the Theosophist movement to gain strength.
• Annie Besant was elected its president in 1907.
• The Theosophists stood for the revival of the ancient Indian religion
and universal brotherhood.
• Theosophist popularised the study of oriental classics, especially
Upanishads and Bhagwat Gita.
Seva Samiti
• Seva Samiti was founded by Hridayanath Kunzru.
• Founded in 1914 at Allahabad, the Seva Samiti had
as its objective to organise social service during
natural disasters like floods and epidemics, to
promote the spread of education, cooperation,
sanitation, to uplift depressed classes, reform
criminals and rescue the fallen.
RadhaSwami Movement
• Radhaswami Movement was founded in 1861 by Tulsi
Ram, of Agra, a banker by profession.
• Tulsi Ram was also popularly known as Shiv Dayal
Saheb or Swamiji Maharaj.
• The Radhaswamis believe in one Supreme being,
Satsang and simple social life.
• They believe that there is no need to renounce the
worldly life for spiritual attainments.
• Works of faith and charity, the spirit of service and
prayer are laid down as necessary duties.
Deva Samaj
• This sect was founded in 1887 at Lahore by Shiv Narain
Agnihotri, an erstwhile follower of Brahmo Samaj.
• The teachings of the Samaj were compiled in book form
in Deva Shastra.
• The teachings of the Deva Samaj emphasise the Supreme
Being, eternity of the soul, the supremacy of the Guru and’
need for good action.
• The Samaj prescribed ideal social conduct and moral ethics,
such as not accepting bribe, abstaining from gambling,
intoxicants, non-vegetarian food and violence.
• The movement, however, lost its popular appeal after 1813,
when Agnihotri appointed his second son, Devanand, to
succeed him.
ALIGARH MOVEMENT (Reformist)
• This movement was started by Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan in the
1860’s in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh.
• It focused on spreading western scientific education among
the Muslim masses in India.
• In 1862, he founded the Scientific Society to translate English
books on science and other subjects into Urdu.
• It helped to develop a modern outlook among its students.
This intellectual movement is called the Aligarh Movement.
• For a rational and scientific order in a society, he founded a
scientific society in 1864, an Urdu journal, Tahzib-al-akhlaq in
1870, and he Aligarh school in 1875 and later known as
Mohammedan Oriental College and then Aligarh Muslim
University.
• Syed Ahmad Khan believed that the interest of the Muslims would be best
served through cooperation with the British Government.
• It was only through the guidance of the British that India could mature
into a full-fledged nation.
• So he opposed the participation of the Muslims in the activities of the
Indian National Congress.
DEOBAND MOVEMENT
• This was started in 1867 in Deoband in UP by
Muhammad Qasim Nanawatawi and Rashid
Ahmad Gangohi to promote studies in classical
Islam and moral and religious regeneration of
the Muslims.
• It was an anti-British movement that aimed at
the uplifting the Muslims through educational
efforts.
Ahmadiya Movement
• The Ahmadiya movement was launched by Mirza Ghulam
Ahmad of Qadiyan (1839-1908) in 1889, who began his work
as a defender of Islam against the polemics of the Arya Samaj
and the Christian missionaries.
• In 1889 he claimed to be masih (messiah) and mahdi, and
later also to be an incarnation of the Hindu god Krishna and
Jesus returned to earth. Ghulam Ahmad, though called
himself a minor prophet, regarded Muhammad as the true
and great Prophet whom he followed.
• The Ahmadiya movement based itself, like the Brahmo Samaj,
on the principles of a universal religion of all humanity.
• The Ahmadiyas opposed jihad or sacred war against nonMuslims and stressed fraternal relations among all people.
SATYASHODHAK SAMAJ
• This society was founded by Jyotirao Govindrao Phule on
24 September 1873 in present-day Maharashtra.
• It campaigned against idolatry and the caste system.
• It advocated rational thinking and rejected priesthood.
• Jyotirao Phule is said to have used the term ‘Dalit’ for the
oppressed castes.
• He worked to liberate the Shudra and Untouchable
castes from exploitation and oppression.
• He also challenges the superiority and domination
complex of Brahmans.
• His books Ghulamgiri and Sarvajanik Satyadharma Pustak
questioned the traditional customs and beliefs of society.
Justice party Movement
• The root of the Dravidian movement lies in Brahmin-non-Brahmin
conflict.
• The non-Brahmans started demanding their right and questioned
the dominance of Brahmins in each and every sphere.
• In 1916, Zamindars and Maharajas in order to counter growing
clout of Brahmins in society and politics, established South India
Welfare Association in Madras Presidency.
• The organization had eminent non-Brahman leaders as Dr TM Nair,
Theagaroya Chetty, Dr C Natesa Mudaliar, Panagal’s Raja and Sir A
Ramaswamy Mudaliar.
• It started publishing English newspaper ‘Justice’, with growing
popularity the society came to be known as Justice Party.
• This Justice party contested the election and for the first time in
1921 Indian cabinet was formed in Madras Presidency.
Self-respect Movement
• In 1925, E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker who was popularly known as Periyar was not
happy with the Brahminical dominance in society as well as in Congress Party
that he believed was controlled by Brahmins.
• To assert the rights of non-Brahmins, he established Self-Respect Movement in
1925.
• The aim was to have a society with equal human rights for backward castes.
• Anti-Brahminism and Self-respect Marriages were two important aspects of Selfrespect Movement.
• The movement encouraged inter-caste and inter-religious marriages, along with
that it also encouraged marriage ceremonies without Brahmin priest.
• Post independence, Tamilnadu passed a law and become the first state to
legalize Hindu marriage without Brahmin priest.
Depressed Class Institute
(Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha)
• Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar’s movement worked for the
upliftment of untouchables by fighting for their
educational, legal and political rights and encouraging
them to throw off the traditional caste duties imposed
on them.
• He founded Depressed Class Institute (Bahishkrit
Hitkarini Sabha) in Bombay in 1924, a Marathi
fortnightly Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha in 1927 and
Samaj Samata Sangha in 1927. He also founded the
Independent labour Party.
• The Scheduled Caste Federation, a political party, was
formed by him in 1942.
The Nirankari Movement
• This movement, initially an offshoot of Sikhism, was
founded in the 1840s by Baba Dayal Das (1783-1885).
• His approach meant a rejection of idols, rituals associated
with idolatry and the Brahman priests who conducted
these rituals.
• Dayal Das’s disciples were to worship the formless God,
obey the shabad (preaching) of the Guru, serve their
parents, avoid bad habits and earn their livelihood
through work.
• Eating meat, drinking liquor, lying, cheating, etc., were
forbidden.
• The Nirankari movement stressed proper religious
practice and issued hukmnamas (injunctions) to define its
ideology and precepts.
• The Nirankaris set up a chain of worship centres staffed by
their own priests and thus became a permanent subsect
of the Sikh religion.
The Namdhari Movement
• The Namdhari movement of the Sikhs was an
offshoot of the Kuka movement in Punjab,
founded by Balak Singh.
• Under Ram Singh’s leadership, the Namdharis
sought a resurgence of Sikh rule in the Punjab.
• In January 1872, British police apprehended
and executed by cannon about 65 Namdharis.
Ram Singh was exiled to Rangoon, Burma (now
Yangon, Myan.).
The Singh Sabha
• To strengthen Sikhism, a small group of
prominent Sikhs, led by Thakur Singh
Sandhawalia and Giani Gian Singh,
founded the Singh Sabha of Amritsar on
October 1, 1873.
• The objectives of the Sabha were to
restore Sikhism to its pristine purity, to
publish historical religious books and
periodicals, to propagate, knowledge
using Punjabi, to return Sikh apostates to
their faith and to involve Englishmen in
the educational programme of the Sikhs.
Gurdwara Reform Movements
• Before 1920 the Sikh Gurdwaras were governed by the Udasi Sikh mahants,
who treated the gurdwara offerings and other income of the gurdwaras as
their personal income.
• The British Government supported these mahants as a counterpoise to the
rising tide of nationalism among the Sikhs.
• Under the growing pressure of the nationalists and the gurdwara agitators,
the gurdwaras came under the control of an elected committee known as
the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, in November 1920.
• The movement for the liberation of the gurdwaras soon turned into the Akali
movement, which later on got divided into three streams, namely moderate
nationalist reformers, pro-government loyalists and the political organ of
Sikh communalism.
Social Service League (1911)
• Narayan Malhar Joshi, a leading member of the
Servants of India Society, founded the Social
Service League in 1911.
• The objective of the movement was “to collect
and study social facts and discuss social problems
with a view to forming public opinion on
questions of social service” and to secure for the
masses a better quality of life and work.
• The League opened a number of day and night
schools, libraries, dispensaries and started boys’
clubs and scouts corps.
Poona Seva Sadan
To promote the welfare of
women, Poona Seva Sadan
was founded by
G.K.Devadhar and Ramabai
Ranade (wife of
M.G.Ranade) in 1909 at
Pune, Maharashtra.

SOILS AND
AGRICULTURE
OF INDIA
PART-1
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• Soil is the mixture of rock debris and organic materials,
which develop on the earth’s surface.
• Pedology is the study of soils in their natural environment.
• Pedogenesis is the natural process of soil formation that
includes a variety of processes such as weathering,
leaching, calcification etc..
Soil Types
• If soil contains greater proportion of big
particles it is called sandy soil.
Sandy
• If the proportion of fine particles is relatively Clayey higher, then it is called clayey soil.
• If the amount of large and fine particles is about
the same, then the soil is called loamy.
Loamy
Clayey and loamy soils are both suitable for growing cereals like wheat, and
gram. Such soils are good at retaining water.
For paddy, soils rich in clay and organic matter and having a good capacity
to retain water are ideal.
For lentils (masoor) and other pulses, loamy soils, which drain water easily,
are required.
For cotton, sandy loam or loam, which drain water easily and can hold
plenty of air, are more suitable.
Factors Determining Soils’ Characteristics
The major
factors that
determine soils’
characteristics
are
• Parent Material
• Climate
• Relief
• Vegetation
• Time and
• Some other Lifeforms.
Factors Determining Soils’ Characteristics
Parent rocks
• The rock from which the soil is formed
• Decomposition and disintegration of parent rock under the
processes of weathering
• The characteristics of rocks influence the characteristics of
soils
• Examples: we get black soils From Lava rocks and iron oxide
from red soils
Climate
• Influence the rate of weathering of rocks
• The crystalline granites produce laterite soil in relatively
moist parts of the monsoonal region and non-laterite soil in
drier areas.
• Hot summer and low rainfall develops black soil as is found
in some parts of Tamil Nadu irrespective of the parent rock.
• In Rajasthan, both granite and sandstone give birth to
sandy soil under arid climate
Slope/Relief
• The nature of relief and slope influence the accumulation
of soils
• That is why Mountains have thin soil cover but the plains
have thick soil cover
• The areas of low relief or gentle slope generally experience
deposition and have deep soils. Example: Indo-Gangetic
plain.
Time
• Provides maturity to the soil
• Various forces of nature such as change in
temperature, actions of running water, wind
and glaciers, activities of decomposers etc.
contribute to the formation of soil.
Natural Vegetation
• The decayed leaf material adds much needed humus
to soil thereby increasing its fertility.
• The densely forested areas contain some of the best
soils in India.
Constituents
•Mineral particles
•Humus
•Water and
•Air
Major
constituents
of the soil
are
Soil Profile
• A soil horizon is a layer generally
parallel to the soil crust, whose
physical characteristics differ
from the layers above and
beneath.
• Soil Horizon is classified into
three categories — Horizon A,
Horizon B, and Horizon C;
collectively known as Soil Profile
(i.e. the arrangement of soil
layers).
Soil Profile
• The uppermost horizon is
generally dark in colour as it is rich
in humus and minerals. The
humus makes the soil fertile and
provides nutrients to growing
plants.
• This layer is generally soft, porous
and can retain more water. It is
called the topsoil or the A-horizon.
Soil Profile
• The next layer has a lesser
amount of humus but more of
minerals. This layer is generally
harder and more compact and is
called the B-horizon or the
middle layer.
• The third layer is the C-horizon,
which is made up of small lumps
of rocks with cracks.
Classification of Soil
including
texture, color, slope of land, and moisture content in the soil.
Soils were classified on the basis of
their inherent characteristics and external features
• Alluvial soils
• Black soils
• Red and Yellow soils
• Laterite soils
• Arid soils
• Mountain soils
• Saline soils
• Peaty soils
On the basis of
genesis, color,
composition,
and location,
the soils of India
have been
classified as
Alluvial soils
Black soils
Red and Yellow soils
Laterite soils
Arid soils
Mountain soils
Saline soils
Peaty soils
Alluvial Soils
• Alluvial soils are widespread in the northern
plains and the river valleys and cover about
40% of total area of India.
• Alluvial soils are depositional soils, as
transported and deposited by the rivers
streams.
• Highly fertile Riverine soils
• Largest Tract is Satluj Ganga Plains
• Alluvial soils are normally rich in potash, but
poor in phosphorous.
Alluvial Soils
• The alluvial soils normally vary in nature from sandy,
loamy, to clayey and its color varies from light grey
to ash grey
• In the Upper and Middle Ganga plain, two different
types of alluvial soils are found i.e. Khadar (it is the
new alluvium and is deposited by floods annually)
and Bhangar (it is a system of older alluvium,
deposited away from the flood plains).
• They also occur in deltas of the Mahanadi, the
Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery, where they
are called deltaic alluvium (coastal alluvium)
Alluvial Soils
• Some alluvial soils are found in the Narmada,
Tapi valleys and Northern parts of Gujarat.
• They are best suited for agriculture.
• They are best suited to irrigation and respond
well to canal and well/tube-well irrigation.
• They yield splendid crops of rice, wheat,
sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, jute, maize,
oilseeds, vegetables and fruits.
Alluvial Soils
Bhabar
• Along the Shiwalik foothills.
• The area is not suitable for agriculture and only big
trees with large roots thrive in this belt.
Terai
• The underground streams of the Bhabar belt re-emerge in this belt.
It is a swampy lowland with silty soils.
• The terai soils are rich in nitrogen and organic matter but
are deficient in phosphate.
• These soils are generally covered by tall grasses and forests but are
suitable for a number of crops such as wheat, rice, sugarcane, jute
etc..
Bhangar
• The Bhangar is the older alluvium
• A few metres below the terrace of the bhangar are
beds of lime nodules known as “Kankar”.
Khadar
• The Khadar is composed of newer alluvium and forms
the flood plains along the river banks.
• The banks are flooded almost every year and a new
layer of alluvium is deposited with every flood. This
makes them the most fertile soils of Ganges.
Black Soils
• Formed By solidification of Lava
• Also popular as Regur Soil or the Black
Cotton Soil, Black soil covers most of the
Deccan Plateau; for example, black soil is
found in parts of Maharashtra, Madhya
Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and
Tamil Nadu. (16.6 per cent of the total
area)
Black Soils
• Black soil is usually clayey, deep, and
impermeable; therefore, it can retain the
moisture for a very long time (very useful for the
crops especially cotton).
• Black soil is rich in lime, iron, magnesia,
alumina, and also potash.
• The color of the black soil varies from deep
black to grey.
• Other major crops grown on the black soils
include wheat, jowar, linseed, virginia tobacco,
castor, sunflower and millets.
Red & Yellow Soils
• Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in the
areas of low rainfall, especially, in the eastern and
southern parts of the Deccan Plateau.
• Red soil develops a reddish color because of a wide
diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic
rocks. On the other hand, it develops yellow color
when it occurs in a hydrated form.
• The fine-grained red and yellow soils are usually
fertile, whereas coarse-grained soils found in dry
upland areas have poor fertility.
Red & Yellow Soils
• The red and yellow soils normally have poor content
of nitrogen, phosphorous and humus.
• They are fairly rich in potash and potassium.
• The red colour is due to the presence of iron oxide.
• (10.6 per cent) of the total area of the country.
• These soils are spread on almost the whole of Tamil
Nadu.
Red & Yellow Soils
• Other regions with red soil include parts of
Karnataka, south-east of Maharashtra, Telangana,
Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,
Odisha, Chota Nagpur plateau; parts of south Bihar,
West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh; Aravalis and the
eastern half of Rajasthan (Mewar or Marwar
Plateau), parts of North-Eastern states.
• The red soils are mostly loamy and hence cannot
retain water like the black soils.
• The red soils, with the proper use of fertilizers and
irrigation techniques, give good yield of cotton,
wheat, rice, pulses, millets, tobacco, oil seeds,
potatoes and fruits.
Laterite Soils
• Laterite soils are mostly the end products of
weathering.
• They are formed under conditions of high
temperature and heavy rainfall with
alternate wet and dry periods/ under
monsoon conditions
• Heavy rainfall promotes leaching (nutrients
gets washed away by water) of soil
whereby lime and silica are leached away
and a soil rich in oxides of iron and
aluminium compounds is left behind.
Laterite Soils
• ‘Laterite’ means brick in Latin. They
harden greatly on loosing moisture.
• Laterite soils are red in color due to
little clay and more gravel of bauxite or
ferric oxides.
• They are very poor in lime,
magnesia, potash and nitrogen.
• Sometimes, the phosphate content may
be high in the form of iron phosphate.
Laterite Soils
• In wetter places, there may be higher content of
humus.
• When manured and irrigated, some laterites are
suitable for growing plantation crops like tea,
coffee, rubber, cinchona, coconut, areca nut, etc.
• Laterite and lateritic soils provide valuable
building material.
• The laterite soils are commonly found in
Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya
Pradesh, and the hilly areas of Odisha and
Assam.
Arid Soils
• Found in areas with rainfall<50 cm
• Sandy, porous, coarse & rich in salts
• Generally saline due to high evaporation
• Lower horizons of the arid soils are
occupied by ‘kankar’ layers because of the
increasing calcium content downwards.
Arid Soils
• Arid soils have poor content of humus and
organic matter.
• Arid soils are typically developed in western
Rajasthan.
• Cereals grown are Jowar, Bajra, Ragi & Oil
seeds
• Drought resistance crops
Mountain Soils
• Prone to soil erosion and top soil getting washed
away due to the steep slopes of the mountains
after a heavy rainfall
• These soils are mostly thin and infertile
• Rich in humus but deficient in potash,
phosphorous and lime
• Useful for Tea, coffee, spices and tropical fruits
• Found in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh,
Uttaranchal, Assam, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh
Saline Soils
• Saline soils contain a larger proportion of
sodium, potassium, and magnesium, and
thus, they are infertile, and do not support
vegetation.
• Because of the dry climate and poor
drainage system, saline soil contains more
salt.
• Saline soils are normally found in arid and
semi-arid regions, as well as in
waterlogged and swampy areas.
Saline Soils
• Highly saline due to dry climate, poor
drainage & high evaporation
• Deficient in nitrogen and calcium, saline
soils are found in western Gujarat, deltas
of the eastern coast, and in Sunderban
areas of West Bengal.
Peaty Soils
• In the areas of heavy rainfall and high humidity, large
quantity of dead organic matter accumulates and
enrich humus and organic content that forms the
peaty soils.
• Peaty soils are normally heavy and black in color and
widely found in the northern part of Bihar, southern
part of Uttaranchal, and the coastal areas of West
Bengal, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu.
• Decline in soil fertility because of any reason (either
natural or human induced) is known as soil
degradation

Salinity of soils
• Predominance of Chloride & sulfates of N, Ca & Mg,
Esp. of NaCO3
• Decreases soil fertility
• Addition of Gypsum, Addition of rice husk & rice
straw also counters alkalinity by forming light acids
Soil Erosion
• Washing away of topmost fertile layer of the soil
by the action of wind or water
• “Soil erosion is essentially a problem created
by man and also faced by man himself.”
• Water erosion leads to rilling, gullying, sheetwash and rain peeling.
• If erosion continues unchecked for a long time,
numerous finger-shaped grooves may develop
in the silt laden soils. The whole pattern
resembles the shape of a tree. This is called rill
erosion.
Sheet Erosion
• When a gully bed is eroded further, the
bed gradually deepens and flattens out
and a ravine is formed. The depth of a
ravine may extend to 30 metres or
more.
• When the entire top sheet of soil is
washed away by water or by wind,
leaving behind barren rock, it is
called sheet erosion.
Sea Erosion
• In estuaries, tidal bores cause extensive damage to the
surrounding banks. This is called sea erosion.
Glacial Erosion
• In the higher reaches of the
Himalayan region, soil erosion is
caused by sowing moving
glaciers. This is called glacial
erosion.
• Wind erosion or Aeolian
erosion is quite significant in
arid and semi-arid regions.
• Desertification around desert
regions is due to wind erosion.
Causes of Soil Erosion
Over-grazing
Deforestation
Action of wind
Water Glacier
Topography viz. steep slopes & heavy rainfall
Faulty methods of agriculture
Over-irrigation
Shifting agriculture and
Some anthropogenic factors viz. Mining and industrial activities etc.
Effects of Soil Erosion
Loss of fertile top soil
Lowering of the underground water table and
decreasing soil moisture
Drying of vegetation and extension of arid lands
Increase in the frequency of droughts and floods
Prevention of Soil Erosion Techniques
Terrace Farming
 On hilly slopes, terraces act as bunds
and prevent the soil from being washed
away
 Farming is done on a unique step like
structure and the force of water
running off is slowed down
 Terraced farming is more common on
small farms and in underdeveloped
countries, since mechanized equipment
is difficult to deploy in this setting
Contour ploughing
• Land should never be ploughed up & down
as it increases erosion
• Ploughing along contours on a slope
prevents soil being washed away by
rainwater or by surface run off
• Contours act like bunds and thus prevents
soil erosion by allowing water to slowly
penetrate the soil
Contour barriers/Contour trenching
• Contour-strips which intercept down slope
flowing water and soil particles
• Several 2 feet by one foot trenches are
formed across the slopes at suitable
intervals
• Tree seedlings are to be planted above the
trench
• These barriers slow down the water
movement and reduce its erosive force
• They also filter out and trap many of the
suspended soil particles, keeping them
from being washed out of the field
Afforestation
• Planting of trees along the edges of the fields,
the waste land and on steep slopes to prevent
soil erosion
• Also to enhance the capacity of the soil to
retain water
Shelter Belts
• A line of trees or shrubs planted
to protect an area, especially a
field of crops, from fierce
weather
• Farmers plant trees in several
rows to check wind erosion
• Also known as wind breaks
Cover crops/Crop rotations
• Crop rotation is a practice in which a different crop is cultivated on a piece
of land each year.
• This helps to conserve soil fertility as different crops require different
nutrients from the soil. Crop rotation will provide enough time to restore
lost nutrients.
• Cover crops such as legumes, white turnip, radishes and other species are
rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round
• Act as green manure that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients
• Also help suppress weeds & increase soil fertility
No-till farming
• Also called zero-tillage or direct drilling
• (Tillage is the preparation of land for growing crops with the help of tractors)
• A way of growing crops or pasture from year to year without disturbing the soil
through tillage
• Increases the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil
• Also increases organic matter retention and cycling of nutrients in the soil
• keeps soils anchored in place rather than having bare ground exposed to wind and
water
Strip Cropping
• Crops are grown in alternate strips of land to
check the impact of the winds
• It is used when a slope is too steep or when
there is no alternative method of preventing soil
erosion.
• Contour strip cropping → Cultivation of soil
protecting crops in strips alternating with
erosion permitting crops. The strips should be
across the slope.
• Field strip cropping → Plants are cultivated in
parallel strips across the slopes
Mulching
• Mulches are materials placed over the soil
surface to maintain moisture and improve
soil conditions
• A protective layer of a material that is spread
on top of the soil
• Mulches can either be organic — such as
grass clippings, straw, bark chips, and similar
materials
• Or inorganic — such as stones, brick chips,
and plastic
Construction of Dams
• Rivers causes soil erosion
• Dams are built in the upper course of rivers to
control erosion of soil
• This would check the speed of water and thereby
save soil from erosion

catchment surfaces.
Rainwater Harvesting
Organic Farming
• Excludes the use of manufactured fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides &
herbicides
• Strictly prohibits the use of plant growth regulators, livestock antibiotics, food
additives, and genetically modified organisms
• Relies on techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, bio-fertilizers, compost
and biological pest control to maintain soil productivity
• It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local
conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects

Sound
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Sound
• Sound waves are mechanical longitudinal waves and require medium for
their propagation. It cannot propagate through vacuum. when propagated
speed and wavelength changes but frequency remains constant. It is of
three types:
1. The sound waves which lie in the frequency range 20 Hz to 20000 Hz
are called audible waves.
2. The sound waves having frequencies less than 20 Hz are called
infrasonic. These sounds are produced by sources of bigger size such
as earthquakes, volcanic eruption, ocean waves and by elephants
and whales.
Sound
3. The sound waves having frequencies greater than 20000 Hz are called
ultrasonic waves.
• Human ears cannot detect these waves. Dogs, cat, bat, mosquito can detect
these waves Bat not only detect it but can produce ultrasonic waves as well.
• Application of Ultrasonic waves:
• For sending signals For measuring the depth of sea.
• For cleaning clothes, aeroplane and machinery parts of clocks.
• In sterilizing of a liquid.
• In Ultrasonography
• In remaining lamp short from chimney of factories.
Properties of Sound Wave Reflection
• The bouncing back of sound when it strikes a hard surface, is called
reflection of sound.
• The laws of reflection of light are also obeyed during reflection of sound.
• The working of megaphone, sound boards and ear trumpet is based on
reflection of sound.
• The repetition of sound due to reflection of sound waves, is called an
echo.
• The persistence of hearing on human ear is 1/10th of a second.
Properties of Sound Wave Reflection
• The minimum distance from a sound reflecting surface to hear an echo is
nearly is nearly 17 m.
• Sound proof rooms are made of two layers of walls having vacuum
between them.
• Reverberation arises due to multiple reflection of sound.
• While designing an auditorium for speech or musical concerts, one has to
take proper care for the absorption and reflection of sound.
• Reverberation time (RT) is a measure of the amount of reverberation in a
space and equal to the time required for the level of a steady sound to
decay by 60 dB after the sound has stopped.
Speed of Sound
• Speed of sound is maximum in solids minimum in gases.
• When sound goes from one medium to another medium, its speed and
wave length changes, but frequency remain unchanged.
• The speed of sound remains unchanged by the increase or decrease of
pressure.
• The speed of sound increases with the increase of temperature of the
medium.
• The speed of sound is more in humid air than in dry air because the
density of humid air is less than the density (water vapor weighs less than
air)
• Speed of sound increases with increase in temperature of medium.
• Because it is less dense, sound passes through hot air faster than it passes
through cold air.
• Intensity: Due to intensity a sound appears loud or faint to the ear.
• The sensation of a sound perceived in ear is measured by another term
called LOUDNESS which depends on intensity of sound sensitiveness of
ear.
• Unit of loudness is Bel. A practical unit of loudness is decibel (dB) which is
equal to 1/10th of a bel.
• Pitch: pitch is a characteristic of sound which distinguishes a sharp sound
from a dull or flat sound.
• Higher the frequency, higher will be the pitch.
• Interference of sound: Modification or redistribution of energy at a point
due to superposition of two or more sound waves of same frequency.
• If two waves meet at a point in same phase, intensity of sound is
maximum at that point. Such type of interference is called constructive
interference.
• Similarly, if two waves meet at a point in opposite phase, intensity of
sound at that point is minimum. Such type of interference is called
destructive interference.
Sound
• Echo: The repetition of sound due to reflection of sound waves is called an
echo.
• Intensity: It is defined as amount of energy passing normally per unit area
held around that point per source unit time.Its unit is watt/metre.
Loudness depends on Intensity of sound. Unit of loudness is bel and
practical unit is decibel which is one tenth of bel.
• Pitch: The sensation of a frequency is commonly referred to as the pitch of
a sound. It distinguishes between shrillness or graveness of sound. A still
and sharp sound has higher pitch and dull sound has lower pitch.
• SONAR: It stands for SOund NAvigation and Ranging. It is used to measure
the depth of a sea, to locate the enemy submarines and shipwrecks.
• Quality of the sound : enables us to distinguishes between two sounds
produced by two sources having the same intensity and pitch.
• Refraction: When a sound wave moves from one mechanical medium to
another mechanical medium, it shows deviation from the original path of
the incident wave. The phenomenon is called refraction. It is due to
difference in speed of sound in media.
• For e.g. On a warm day, the air near the ground is warmer than the air
above and so the speed of the sound waves near the ground is higher.
Thus causing bending of sound away from the ground.
• On a cold day reverse happens, that’s why sound can be heard over larger
distance.
Refraction & Diffraction
• Diffraction: When sound waves originated by a vibrating source, they
spread in the medium and if the medium is homogeneous, this leads to
bending of sound waves around the edges, which is known as diffraction.
The sound waves diffracted broadly and one can easily hears the voice of
the another person.
Musical Scale
• In theory of music, a musical scale is a set of musical notes by the
frequencies of which are in simple ratios to one another.
• Sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni is one such scale called the diatonic scale.
• The frequencies of these notes are: sa (256), re (288), ga (320), ma
(341.3), pa (384), dha (426.7) and ni (480). The next note denoted by sa
has a frequency 512, twice that of sa.
• The interval sa-sa is called an octave (8).
• Musical sound has three characteristics :
• Intensity or Loudness, Pitch or Frequency and Quality or Timbre
Noise Reduction in Recording Media
• Five types of noise reduction system exists in recording media as
discussed below
1. Dolby A noise reduction system, intended for use in professional
recording studios. It provided about 10 dB of broadband noise
reduction.
2. Dolby B was developed to achieve about 9 dB noise reduction
primarily for cassettes. It was much simpler than Dolby A and
therefore less expensive to implement in consumer products.
Noise Reduction in Recording Media
3. Dolby C provides about 15 dB noise reduction.
4. Dolby SR (Spectral Recording) system is much more aggressive noise
reduction approach than Dolby A. Dolby SR is much more expensive
to implement than Dolby B or C, but it is capable of providing upto
25 dB noise reduction in the high frequency range.
5. Dolby S is found on some Hi-Fi and semiprofessional recording
equipment. It is capable of 10 dB of noise reduction at low
frequencies and upto 24 dB of noise reduction at high frequencies.
Doppler’s Effect
• The apparent change in the frequency of source due to relative motion
between the source and observer is called Doppler’s effect.
Applications of Doppler’s Effect
• The measurement of Doppler shift (based on Doppler’s effect) has been
used
 By police to check over speeding of vehicles.
 At airports to guide the aircraft.
 To study heart and blood flow in different parts of the body.
 By astrophysicist to measure the velocities of planets and stars.
SONAR
• SONAR stands for Sound Navigation and Ranging. It is used to measure
the depth of a sea, to locate the enemy submarines and shipwrecks.
• The transmitter of sonar produces pulses of ultrasonic sound waves of
frequency of about 50000 Hz. The reflected sound waves are received by
the receiver.
Human Ear
• We are able to hear with the help of an extremely sensitive
organ of our body called the ear. There are three parts of
human ear
 The outer ear is called pinna. It collects the sound
from the surroundings. The middle ear transmits the
amplified pressure variations received from the sound
wave to the inner ear.
• In the inner ear, the pressure variations are turned into
electrical signals by the cochlea. These electrical signals
are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve and the brain
interprets them as sound.
• Mach Number: It is defined as the ratio of speed of sound source to the speed of
sound in the same medium under the same condition of temperature and
pressure.
• If Mach Number> 1, body is called supersonic
• If Mach Number> 5, body is called hypersonic.
• If Mach Number < 1, body is said to be moving with subsonic speed
• Shock waves: A body moving with supersonic speed in air leaves behind it a
conical region of disturbance which spreads continuously. Such a disturbance is
called shock wave. These waves carry huge energy and may even make cracks in
window panes or even damage a builiding.
• Bow waves : when a motor boat in a sea travels faster than sound, then wave just
like shock-wave are produced on the surface of water. These waves are called Bow
waves.
Facts
• Sound waves cannot be heard on the surface of moon and in the outer
space because there is no air in the moon.
• The speed of sound in air is very slower as compared to the speed of light
in air. Therefore in rainy season, the flash of lightening is seen first and the
sound of thunder is heard a little later.

HOW THE BILLS ARE PASSED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE?
The bills at the state level are divided into 2 categories.
– Ordinary bills
– Money bills
Note: In case of unicameral legislature all the bills are introduced in the assembly,
if it is passed the bill will be forwarded to the Governor for his assent.
ORDINARY BILL:
An ordinary bill can be introduced in either of the houses of the state legislature.
If a bill that is introduced in the assembly is not passed, then the bill is considered
to be rejected and the bill does not go to the legislative council.
When a bill is passed by the assembly and forwarded to the council then
1. The council may pass the bill as sent by the assembly
2. The council may reject the bill.
3. The council may pass the bill with amendments (changes) and return the
bill to the assembly for reconsideration.
4. The council may not take any action and keeps the bill pending.
• If the council passes the bill without amendments the bill is deemed to be
passed by both the houses and is sent to the Governor for his assent.
• If the council passes the bill with amendments and the assembly accepts the
same then also the bill is considered to be passes and forwarded to the
Governor for his assent.
• If the assembly rejects the amendments as suggested by the council
 OR
the council rejects the bill all together
 OR
If the council does not take any action for a period of three months
then the assembly may pass the bill again and forward the same to the council.
• If the council rejects the bill again

bill is passed by the legislature and sent to the governor for assent the
governor must give the assent.
• The Governor may reserve the bill for the consideration of the President. The
President may either give the assent
OR
withhold the assent to the bill
OR
return the bill for reconsideration
• The state legislature must consider the bill within six months.
• The bill is presented again to the presidential assent after it is passed by the
legislature with or without amendments.
• Constitution is silent on the action of the President after reconsideration by
the state legislature.

Post Mauryan India
Sungas Dynasty, Satavahanas
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Post Mauryan India
• After Ashoka’s death, his successors were not able to keep the vast
Mauryan kingdom intact. Provinces started declaring independence. N-W
India slipped out of Mauryan control & a series of foreign invasion affected
this region.
• Kalinga declared its independence & in further south Satavahanas
declared their independent rule
• As a result, the Mauryan empire was confined to Gangetic valley & soon
replaced by Sunga dynasty
Sungas Dynasty
• Pushyamitra Sunga was Brahmin army chief of
Brihadratha, the last king of the Mauryas.
• Founder of Sunga dynasty was Pushyamitra Sunga,
who was commander in chief under the Mauryas.
• After the invasion from Bactrian Greeks from N-W,
Greeks advanced upto Patliputra & occupied it for
some time but Pusyamitra sunga reclaimed it.
• Pushyamitra Sunga’s capital was at Pataliputra.
Sungas Dynasty
• He successfully countered attacks from two Greek kings namely,
Menander and Demetrius.
• He also fought against Kharvela of Kalinga who invaded N- India
• Pushyamitra was a staunch follower of Brahamanism & persecuter of
Budhhists, however he patronised buddhist art & during his reign.
• Buddhist monuments of Bharut (MP) & Sanchi were renovated. He built
the sculptured stone gateway at Sanchi.
Sungas Dynasty
• During their rule there was a revival of Brahamanical influence. The
Bhagvata religion became important.
• He performed Vedic sacrifices such as Ashvamedha, Rajasuya and
Vajapeya.
• Pushyamitra Sunga patronised the Sanskrit grammarian Patanjali who
wrote Mahabhasya and it was the commentary on Panini’s Sanskrit
grammar Ashtadhyayi.
• According to the Puranas, his reign lasted for 36 years. He died in 151 BC.
Agnimitra
• Was Pushyamitra’s son who succeeded him to the
throne.
• His reign lasted from about 149 BC to 141 BC.
• By this time, Vidarbha broke away from the empire.
• Agnimitra is the hero of Kalidasa’s poem,
Malavikagnimitram.
• His son Vasumitra succeeded him as king.
Last of the Sunga kings
• Vasumitra’s successors are not clearly known. Different names crop up in
several accounts such as Andhraka, Pulindaka, Vajramitra and Ghosha.
• The last Sunga king was Devabhuti. He was preceded by Bhagabhadra.
• Devabhuti was killed by his own minister, Vasudeva Kanva in around 73 BC.
This established the Kanva dynasty at Magadha from 73 to 28 BC.
Effects of Sunga rule
• Hinduism was revived under the Sungas.
• The caste system was also revived with the
rise of the Brahmanas.
• Another important development during the
Sunga reign was the emergence of various
mixed castes and the integration of
foreigners into Indian society.
• The language of Sanskrit gained more
prominence during this time. Even some
Buddhist works of this time were composed
in Sanskrit.
Effects of Sunga rule
• The Sungas patronised art and architecture. There was an
increase in the usage of human figures and symbols in art
during this period.
• Hence, Sunga rule was a brilliant anticipation of golden age of
Guptas
Kanva Dynasty
• The Kanva dynasty was a Brahman dynasty
founded by Vasudeva Kanva, the minister
of Devabhuti, the last Sunga king in 75 B.C.
• This period is said to have witnessed the
rule of four kings, extending to a period
about 45 years.
• Susarman was the last ruler of the Kanva
dynasty.
• In 30 B.C., the southern powers swept
away both the Kanvas and Sungas and the
province of Eastern Malwa was absorbed
within the dominions of the Satavahanas
The Chetis of Kalinga
• The Hathigumpha inscription of Kharavela
near Bhubaneshwar, Orissa; of Kharavela, the
third ruler of the dynasty, gives information
about the Chetis.
• Kharavela is said to have defied the
Satavahana ruler, Satakarni, and become free
of the Magadhan empire. He pushed his
southern conquests beyond the Godavari.
• Kharavela was a follower of Jainism, and
patronised Jain monks for whom he
constructed caves in the Udaigiri near
Bhubneshwar in Orissa.
Satavahanas
• In Deccan, Satavahanas established their
independent rule after the decline of Mauryas.
• The most important native successors of the
Mauryas in the Deccan and Central India were the
Satavahanas.
• Their rule lasted for 450 years & were known as
Andhras
• The early Satavahana kings appeared not in Andhra
but in Maharashtra where most of their early
inscriptions have been found.
• Capital → Paithan/ Pratisthan on the river Godavari
Satavahanas
• Founder of Satavahana dynasty was Simuka. He was
succeeded by Krishna, who extended his kingdom to
west uptill Nashik.
• Their empire may have been extended to the Eastern
coast of the peninsula.

rd ruler, raised its power and prestige
by conquests.
• Hala, its 17th ruler, was the author of Gathasaptasati
or Sattasai in Prakrit.
• Gunadhya, the author of Vrihat Katha (in Prakrit) was
the contemporary of Hala.
Satavahanas
• Greatest ruler of Satavahana Dynasty was Gautamiputra Satkarni. (23rd ruler)
• He called himself the only Brahamana.
• Nashik & Nanaghat inscriptions throw light on achievements of Gautamiputra satkarni
• Patronised Brahamanism yet gave donations to Buddhists
• He was succeeded by his son Vashishtaputra Pulamayi who issued coins with the
inscription of images of ships which shows naval power & maritime trade of
Satavahanas
Satavahanas
• Last great ruler of this dynasty was Yajna sri
Satkarni, who recovered Malwa & northern coast
of konkan from Shaka rulers (which was captured
by Rudradaman before)
• It was the Shakas who continued to maintain their
dominance over the Satavahanas.
• Satavahana period saw an extensive growth in
overseas trade.
• Satavahana administration was almost same as
Mauryans as District were called Aharas & officials
Amatyas & Mahamantras.
Satavahanas
• Administration of rural areas was placed under
Gaulmika who was head of military regiment
• The Satvahana kingdom was later divided under
weak successors and one line continued to rule
Andhra.
• Satavahana had to deal with Kharavela kingdom
in Kalinga and also with the Kshatrapas.
• The major dfference between Mauryans and
Satvahanas was the absence of a strong
bureaucracy.
Satavahanas
• The Satvahana kings were known to donate land with administrative and
fiscal autonomy to brahmins and buddhists.
• The trade was a major source of income for the state.
• Trade routes and highways were constructed to link inland centers with
the ports on the western coast.
• Major ports for trade on the western coast are kalyan, kathiwad, bharuch
etc.
Satavahanas
• Trade was carried out by trading guilds of different artisans. The guilds
dealt with merchant guilds and this link was beneficial for both of them.
• The Merchants were prosperous and donated to the construction of
religious structures.
• From the point of view of agriculture, the rice cultivation flourished in
Krishna and godavari basin. This fertile region also provided inputs to the
trading centers on west coast.
Satavahanas
• Trade was carried out with the mediterranean region too. Trans-peninsular roads
linked major markets with the ports.
• On religious lines, all major religions such as Brahmanism, Buddhism and Jainis
were patronised and they flourished.
• Stupas and chaityas were contructed by the state. Donors were mostly merchant
guilds who contributed generously.

 Swarajists
•Led by C R Das, Motilal Nehru and Ajmal Khan.
•They wanted an end to the boycott of legislative councils.
•They wanted to ‘end or mend’ these councils – oppose the council if the govt does not
listen to their demands
•Their only intention was to use the councils as arena of political struggle;
•Those advocating entry into legislative councils came to be known as the Swarajists.
No Changers
 The ‘No-changers’ opposed council entry
 They advocated concentration on constructive work, and continuation of boycott
and non-cooperation
 They also advocated quiet preparation for resumption of the suspended civil
disobedience programme
 This school of thought was led by Vallabh bhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad,
C.Rajagopalachari & M.A. Ansari
 They came to be known as the ‘No-changers’.
Swaraj Party
 Gaya session – Dec 1922 - The proposal of Swarajists to fight elections failed
 C R Das and Motilal Nehru resigned from the presidency and secretary ship
respectively of the Congress.
 They announced the formation of Congress- Khilaafat Swarajya Party or simply the
“Swarajya Party” (They were joined by some Khilaafat leaders too)
 C R Das was the president and Motilal Nehru was one of the secretaries.
 Both sides wanted to avoid a 1907 type split.
 Both sides also accepted the necessity of Gandhi’s leadership of a united nationalist
front.
 Hence they decided to work as a faction of INC itself and not a separate party
 The Swarajists were allowed to contest elections as a group within the Congress.
 The Swarajists accepted the Congress programme with only one difference—that
they would join legislative councils.
 The Swarajist Manifesto for Elections Released in October 1923 – anti imperial
tone
 In the November 1923 elections, the Swarajists had managed to win 42 out of 104
elected seats and a clear majority in the provincial assembly of Central Provinces
Major Achievements of Swarajists
 Swarajist Vithalbhai Patel became speaker of the Central Legislative
Assembly in 1925.
 They gave fiery speeches in the Assembly on self-rule and civil liberties.
 With coalition partners, they outvoted the Government several times, even
on matters relating to budgetary grants, and passed adjournment motions.
 The defeat of the Public Safety Bill in 1928 - It was aimed at empowering the
Government to deport undesirable and subversive foreigners as the
Government was alarmed by the spread of socialist and communist ideas
and believed that a crucial role was being played by the British and other
foreign activists being sent by the Commintern into India
 Government appointed ‘Muddiman Committee’ to bring out the defects in
the Government of India Act 1919. (Jinnah was a member of this comm.)
Constructive Work by No-Changers
 Ashrams sprang up where young men and women worked, among tribals and lower
castes (especially in Kheda and Bardoli areas of Gujarat),
 Popularised charkha and khadi.
 National schools and colleges were set up.
 Significant work was done for Hindu-Muslim unity,
 removing untouchability, boycott of foreign cloth and liquor, and for flood relief.
 The constructive workers served as the backbone of civil disobedience as active
organisers.
By 1925, the Swarajist position had weakened because of
 Widespread communal riots
 Split among Swarajists themselves
 The death of C.R. Das in 1925
NOTE - In Madras Province, a different Madras Province Swarajya Party was
established in 1923 by S. Sathyamurthy and S. Srinivasa Iyengar. This party
later merged with the Congress in 1935, prior to the elections by the
Government of India Act 1935.
2
nd Phase of
Revolutionary
 Mid 1920s
 Started due to failure of Non Cooperation movement and other
peaceful methods of National
leaders
 Punjab- UP – Delhi were the
epicentre
 Two separate strands of revolutionary terrorist groups emerged during this
period –
1. Punjab-UP-Bihar
2. Bengal
 Novels and books such as Bandi Jiwan by Sachin Sanyal and Pather Dabi by
Sharatchandra Chatterjee (a Government ban only enhanced its popularity) also
enhanced revolutionary terrorism
Revolutionary Terrorism in Punjab-UP-Bihar
• The revolutionary terrorist activity in this region was dominated by the Hindustan
Republican Association/Army or HRA
• The HRA was founded in October 1924 after a meeting of revolutionaries from all
over India in Kanpur
• Imp. Leaders - Ramprasad Bismil, Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Sachin Sanyal
• Later renamed Hindustan Socialist Republican Association or HSRA (by Bhagat
Singh)
AIMS :
• To awaken people of India to the futility of the non violent methods
• to organise an armed revolution to overthrow the colonial government
• establish in its place a Federal Republic of United States of India whose basic
principle would be adult franchise
Kakori Train Robbery (August 1925)
 The most important “action” of the HRA was the Kakori train robbery.
 The men held up a train at Kakori, an obscure village near Lucknow, and looted its
official railway cash.
 Government crackdown after the Kakori robbery led to arrests of many.
 Of whom 17 were jailed, four transported for life and four— Bismil, Ashfaqullah,
Roshan Singh and Rajendra Lahiri—were hanged.
 Hence, Kakori proved to be a setback.
Saunders’ Murder (Lahore, December 1928)
 Bhagat Singh and others shot dead Saunders instead of SP Scott, the police official
responsible for the lath charge on Lala ji in Lahore.
Bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly (April 1929)
 Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Legislative
Assembly on April 8, 1929 against the passage of the Public Safety Bill and Trade
Disputes Bill.
 The bombs had been deliberately made harmless and were aimed at making ‘the
deaf hear’.
 Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were tried in the Lahore conspiracy case
for Saunders murder
 In jail, these revolutionaries protested against the horrible conditions through a
fast, and demanded honourable and decent treatment as political prisoners.
 Bhagat Singh wrote a pamphlet “Why am I an Atheist” while in jail.
 Azad was involved in a bid to blow up Viceroy Irwin’s train near Delhi in
December 1929.
 Azad was killed in a police encounter in a park in Allahabad in February 1931.
 Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged on March 23, 1931.
Chittagong Armoury Raid (April 1930)
 Surya Sen, a school teacher, popularly called ‘Master da’, decided to organise an
armed rebellion along with his associates.
 They had planned to seize and supply arms to the revolutionaries
 They also aimed to destroy telephone and telegraph lines and to dislocate the railway
link of Chittagong with the rest of Bengal.
 The raid was conducted in April 1930 and raid was quite successful; Sen hoisted the
national flag, took salute and proclaimed a provisional revolutionary government.
 Later, they dispersed into neighbouring villages and raided government targets.
 British army killed many revolutionaries while they hid in jungles and ultimately
Master da was also captured in 1933

Temperature Distribution on
Earth and Heat Budget
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Temperature Distribution on Earth
• Sun is the ultimate source of heat.
• The differential heat received from sun by different
regions on earth is the ultimate reason behind all
climatic features.
• So understanding the patterns of distribution of
temperature in different seasons is important for
understanding various climatic features like wind
systems, pressure systems, precipitation etc.
Difference between heat and temperature
• The interaction of incoming solar radiation (insolation) with the
atmosphere and the earth’s surface creates heat. This is measured
in terms of temperature.
• While heat represents the molecular movement of particles
comprising a substance, the temperature is the measurement in
degrees of how hot (or cold) a thing (or a place) is.
• So, heat is the energy which makes things or objects hot, while
temperature measures the intensity of heat (degree of
hotness/coldness).
• Heat and temperature are closely related to each other because
gain or loss of heat is necessary to raise or lower the temperature.
Insolation
• Earth intercepts only one in two billion parts of solar
radiation. This intercepted radiation is called Insolation.
• Some heat within the core and mantle is transferred to the
surface and ocean bottoms through volcanoes, springs and
geysers.
• But this heat received at the surface form interiors of the
earth is negligible compared to that received from sun.
Insolation
• Earth receives Sun’s radiation (heat) in the form of short waves (most of it
is ultraviolet radiation) which are of electromagnetic nature.
• The earth absorbs short wave radiation during daytime and reflects back
the heat received into space as long-wave radiation (mostly infrared
radiation) during night.
• The earth’s surface does not absorb all the energy that it receives.
• The proportion of the solar radiation reflected from the surface is called
Albedo.
• On the average insolation is highest near the tropics, marginally lower at
the equator and lowest at poles.
Factors Affecting Temperature Distribution
• The Angle of Incidence or the Inclination of the Sun’s Rays
Duration of Sunshine
Heat received depends on day or night; clear sky or
overcast, summer or winter etc..
Factors Affecting Temperature Distribution
Land-Sea Differential
• Albedo of land is much greater than albedo of oceans and
water bodies. Especially snow covered areas reflect up to
70%-90% of insolation.
• Average penetration of sunlight is more in water – up to 20
metres, than in land – where it is up to 1 metre only.
• Therefore, land cools or becomes hot more rapidly
compared to oceans due to low specific heat.
Prevailing Winds
• Winds transfer heat from one latitude to another. They also help in
exchange of heat between land and water bodies.
• The oceanic winds have the capacity to take the moderating
influence of the sea to coastal areas – reflected in cool summers
and mild winters. This effect is pronounced only on the windward
side (the side facing the ocean).
• The leeward side or the interiors do not get the moderating effect
of the sea, and therefore experience extremes of temperature.
Aspects of Slope
• Slopes more exposed to the sun receive more solar radiation than
those away from the sun’s direct rays.
• Slopes that receive direct Sun’s rays are dry due to loss of moisture
through excess evaporation.
• These slopes remain barren if irrigational facilities are absent.
• But slopes with good irrigational facilities are good for agriculture
due to abundant sunlight available. They are occupied by dense
human settlements.
• Slopes that are devoid of direct sunlight are usually well forested.

• Ocean Currents
• Ocean Currents are of two types – warm and cold.
• Warm currents make the coasts along which they flow warmer, while cold currents
reduce the temperature of the coasts along which they flow.
• Altitude
 With increase in height, pressure falls, the effect of greenhouse gases
decreases and hence temperature decreases (applicable only to troposphere).
 The normal lapse rate is roughly 1⁰ C for every 165 metres of ascent. Or 6.4
degree celsius for every 1 km.
Earth’s Distance form Sun
• During its revolution around the sun, the earth is farthest
from the sun (152 million km on 4th July). This position of the
earth is called
• On 3rd January, the earth is the nearest to the sun (147
million km). This position is called
• Therefore, the annual insolation received by the earth on 3rd
January is slightly more than the amount received on 4th July.
AIR MASSES
• Like the land and sea breezes, the passage of air masses also
affects the temperature.
• The places, which come under the influence of warm air
masses experience higher temperature and the places that
come under the influence of cold air masses experience low
temperature.
VEGETATION COVER
• Soil devoid of vegetation cover receives heat more
rapidly than the soil under vegetation cover.
• Because vegetation cover absorbs much of sun’s heat
and then prevents quick radiation from the earth
whereas the former radiates it more rapidly.
• Hence the temperature variations in densely forested
areas are lower than those in desert areas.
Heating and Cooling of the Atmosphere
• Sun is the ultimate source of the atmospheric
heat and energy, but its effect is not direct. For
example, as we climb a mountain or ascend in the
atmosphere, temperature become steadily lower,
rather than higher, as we might expect.
Radiation
• It is the process where transference of heat is directly from space to atmosphere
through electromagnetic radiations.
• Photon particles in the radiations collide with the air molecules in the atmosphere
and transfer energy in this process.
• The sun, having an extremely hot surface temperature, radiates fairly short
wavelengths, part of which is felt as warmth, part of which are visible as light.
• The Earth, on the other hand, having a cool surface, reradiates heat at much
longer wavelengths. The re-radiate heat from the earth is called Terrestrial
radiation.
• Atmosphere is transparent to short waves and opaque to long waves. The long
wave radiation is absorbed by the atmospheric gases particularly by carbon
dioxide and the other green house gases. Hence energy leaving the earth’s surface
heats up the atmosphere more than the incoming solar radiation.
Conduction
• When two objects of unequal temperature come in contact with each
other, heat energy flow from the warmer object to the cooler object and
this process of heat transfer is known as conduction.
• The flow continues till temperature of both the objects becomes equal or
the contact is broken.
• The conduction in the atmosphere occurs at zone of contact between the
atmosphere and the earth’s surface by terrestrial radiations.
• However, this is a minor method of heat transfer in terms of warming the
atmosphere since it only affects the air close to the earth’s surface. This is
because of the fact that the air is poor conductor of heat.
Convection
• In this process, energy is transferred through motion of molecules
itself.
• The air in contact with the earth rises vertically on heating in the
form of currents and further transmits the heat of the atmosphere.
• The heating of the air leads to its expansion. Its density decreases
and it moves upwards.
• Continuous ascent of heated air creates vacuum in the lower layers
of the atmosphere. As a consequence, cooler air comes down to fill
the vacuum. This process of vertical heating of the atmosphere is
known as convection.
• The convective transfer of energy is confined only to the
troposphere.
Advection
• The transfer of heat through horizontal movement of air is called
advection.
• The temperature of a place will rise if it lies on the path of winds coming
from warmer regions.
• The temperature will fall if the place lies on the path of the winds blowing
from cold regions.
• Horizontal movement of the air is relatively more important than the
vertical movement.
• In summer seasons, ‘Loo’ of north India is a hot wind and ‘Sirocco’ is also a
hot wind carries heat of Sahara desert to Mediterranean regions.
• In middle latitudes, most of diurnal (day and night) variation in daily
weather is caused by advection alone.
Latitudinal Heat Balance
• The amount of insolation received varies from latitude to latitude.
• Regions within the equator and 40° N and S latitudes receive abundant sunlight
and hence more heat will be gained than lost. Hence they are energy surplus
regions.
• Regions beyond 40° N and S latitudes lose more heat than that gained from
sunlight. Hence they are energy deficit regions (This is because of slant sunlight
and high albedo of polar regions).
• The atmosphere (planetary winds) and the oceans (ocean currents) transfer
excess heat from the tropics (energy surplus region) towards the poles (energy
deficit regions) making up for heat loss at higher latitudes.

Heat Budget
• The earth receives a certain
amount of Insolation (short
waves) and gives back heat
into space by terrestrial
radiation (longwave
radiation). Through this
give and take, or the heat
budget, the earth maintains
a constant temperature.
• Roughly 35 units are reflected
back to space even before
reaching the earth’s surface.
• Reflected from the top of clouds -
27 units
• Reflected by ice-fields on earth -
02 units
• Reflected by the atmosphere - 06
units
• The reflected amount of radiation
is called the albedo of the earth.
The above given radiation does
neither heat the atmosphere nor
the earth’s surface.
• The remaining 65 units are
absorbed as:
• Absorbed by the atmosphere -
14 units
• Absorbed by the earth - 51 units
(Scattered + direct radiation)
• This account of incoming and
outgoing radiation always
maintains the balance of heat on
the surface of the earth. This is
termed the heat budget or heat
balance of the earth.
Temperature Zones
• The earth can be generally
divided into three broad
temperature zones viz.
Torrid Zone, Temperate
Zone and Frigid zone.
Torrid Zone
• Torrid Zone is the tropical region. The temperature remains
high. Sun is directly overhead at least once during the year.
• In the Northern Hemisphere, the overhead Sun moves north
from the equator until it reaches 23.5 °North (Tropic of
Cancer) for the June solstice after which it moves back south
to the equator.
• The year is consequently divided nearly into four equal parts
by the two times at which the sun crosses the equator
(Equinoxes) and those two at which it attains greatest
declinations (Solstices).
• The Torrid Zone forms the hottest region of the world
with two annual seasons namely a dry and a wet season.
This zone includes most of Africa, southern Asia, Indonesia,
New Guinea, northern Australia, southern Mexico, Central
America and northern South America.
Temperate Zones
• Temperate zones are the mid latitudinal
areas, where the temperature is moderate.
• There are two temperate areas viz. North
and South.
• In the two Temperate Zones, the Sun is
never directly overhead, and the climate is
mild, generally ranging from warm to cool.
The four annual seasons, Spring, Summer,
Autumn and Winter occur in these areas.
• The North Temperate Zone includes Great
Britain, Europe, northern Asia, North
America and northern Mexico.
• The South Temperate Zone includes
southern Australia, New Zealand, southern
South America and South Africa.
Frigid Zones
• The two Frigid Zones, or polar regions,
experience the midnight sun and the
polar night for part of the year – the cliff
of the zone experiences one day at the
solstice when the Sun doesn’t rise or set
for 24 hours, while in the centre of the
zone (the pole), the day is literally one
year long, with six months of daylight
and six months of night.
• Frigid Zones are not the coldest parts of
the earth and are covered with ice and
snow.
Distribution of Temperature
• Distribution of temperature varies both horizontally and vertically. Let us
study it under
• A) Horizontal Distribution of Temperature
• B) Vertical Distribution of Temperature
• A) Horizontal Distribution of Temperature
• Distribution of temperature across the latitudes over the surface of the
earth is called its horizontal distribution.
• On maps, the horizontal distribution of temperature is commonly shown
by isotherms.
• Isotherms are line connecting points that have an equal temperature.
• Horizontal Distribution of Temperature in
January
• In January, the sun shines vertically
overhead near the tropic of Capricorn.
Hence, it is summer in southern
hemisphere and winter in the northern
hemisphere.
• A high temperature is found over the
landmasses mainly in three regions of the
southern hemisphere. These regions are
North-West Argentina, East and Central
Africa, and Central Australia.
• Isotherm of 30°C closes them.
• In the northern hemisphere, landmasses are cooler
than the oceans.
• As the air is warmer over the oceans than over
landmasses in the northern hemisphere, the isotherms
bend towards the north (poles) when they cross the
oceans and to the south (equator) over the continents.
• For example : Phenomenon visible over the North
Atlantic Oceans. The presence of warms ocean currents
(Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift) make the
Northern Atlantic Ocean warmer and the isotherms
bend towards the poles. Over the land, the
temperature decreases sharply and the isotherms bend
towards the equator in Europe.
• In the southern hemisphere, the effect of the oceans is
well pronounced (due to few landmasses).
• Here, the isotherms are more or less parallel to the
latitudes and the variation in temperature is more
gradual than in the northern hemisphere.
Horizontal Distribution of Temperature in July
• In July, the sun shines vertically
overhead near the Tropic of cancer.
Hence, high temperatures are found in
the entire northern hemisphere.
• The regions having high temperature
include South Western USA, the
Sahara, the Arabia, Iraq, Iran,
Afghanistan, desert region of India and
China.
• However, the lowest temperature of
0°C is also noticed in the Northern
Hemisphere during summer in the
central part of Greenland.
• During summer in the northern
hemisphere, isotherms bend
towards the equator while crossing
oceans and towards the poles while
crossing landmasses.
• Isotherms are wide spaced over
oceans while they are closely spaced
over landmasses.
• In July, the deviation of isotherms is
not that much pronounced as in
January.
Vertical Distribution of Temperature
• Temperature in the troposphere decreases with an increase in the altitude.
• This vertical gradient of temperature is commonly referred to as the standard atmosphere
or Normal Lapse Rate.
• However, this normal lapse rate varies with height, season, latitude and other factors.
• Indeed the actual lapse rate of temperature does not always show a decrease with altitude.
• Inversion of Temperature :
• In the mountain valleys, the temperature of the air is found increasing with increasing
altitude. Thus there is an inversion of the temperature. This is because during the night, the
quick radiation from the upper exposed slopes of the mountains causes the surface and air
over it to cool rapidly. This cooler air is denser and gets drained by the valley slopes and
displaces the warmer air toward up. So, when we go up in a valley, the temperature seems to
getting increased. This phenomenon is also called drainage inversion.

The Advent of
Europeans in India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

The Advent of Europeans in India
Arrival of Portuguese in India
• It was the Portuguese who first discovered a direct sea route to India.
• Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama arrived at Calicut an important sea port
located on the South-West India on May 20, 1498 AD.
• King Zamorin, the local rule received him and bestowed on him certain
privileges.
• But soon Vasco da Gama came back to India for the second time in 1501
AD. He set up a trading factory at Cannanore.
• With establishment of trade links, Calicut, Cannanore and Cochin emerged
the significant Portuguese centers in India.
Arrival of Portuguese in India
• The hostilities grew and led to full- fledged military face- off between
them. King Zamorin was defeated by the Portuguese.
• With the victory over Zamorin, the military superiority of the Portuguese
was established.
• In 1505 AD, Francisco de Almeida was appointed as the first Portuguese
governor in India. His policy being centric to controlling the Indian Ocean
was known as the Blue Water Policy.
• Alfonso de Albuquerque who replaced Almeida as the governor in 1509
AD, and captured Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 AD is considered
the real founder of the Portuguese power in India. He also abolished Sati.
Rise of Portuguese power In India
• Nino-da-Cunha transferred the portugese capital in India from Cochin to
Goa in 1530 and acquired Diu in 1535 and Daman in 1559.
• Goa subsequently became the headquarters of the Portuguese
settlements in India. Portuguese hold over the coastal areas and
superiority in naval power helped them significantly.
• Portugese lost Hughly in 1631 during the reign of ShahJahan.
• In 1661, The Portugese gave Bombay to Charles II of England as dowry, for
marrying his sister.
• By the end of the 16th century, the Portuguese captured not only Goa,
Daman, Diu, and Salsette but also a vast stretches along the Indian coast
Decline of Portuguese Power
• But the Portuguese rise in Indian had
a short life as the new rival trading
communities from Europe posed a
big challenge to them.
• Struggle among various rival trading
blocs ensued in which Portuguese
had to give way to the more
powerful and enterprising
competitors gradually rendering
them an atrophied entity.
Arrival of the Dutch
• The people of Holland (present
Netherlands) are called the Dutch.
• Next to the Portuguese, the Dutch set
their feet in India.
• Historically the Dutch have been
experts in sea trade.
• In 1602, the United East India Company
of the Netherlands was formed and
given permission by the Dutch
government to trade in the East Indies
including India.
Rise of the Dutch
• The Dutch founded their first factory in Masaulipatam in Andhra Pradesh in 1605.
• Subsequently they also established trading centres in various parts of India.
• Dutch Surat and Dutch Bengal were established in 1616 AD and 1627 AD respectively.
• Main centre of Dutch in India was Pulicat.
• The Dutch conquered Ceylon from the Portuguese in 1656 AD.
• They also took the Portuguese forts on the Malabar coast in 1671 AD.
• It was the first company to issue stock.
• In economic terms, they earned huge profit through business monopolizing in black
pepper and spices. The major Indian commodities traded by the Dutch were cotton,
indigo, silk, rice and opium.
Dutch Coinage
• The Dutch, during their stay in
India, tried their hands on the
minting of coinages.
• As their trade flourished they
established mints at Cochin,
Masulipattam, Nagapatam
Pondicherry and Pulicat.
• Even more, Gold pagoda with an
image of Lord Venkateswara, (god
Vishnu) was issued at Pulicat mint.
Decline of Dutch Power
• Dutch presence on the Indian subcontinent lasted from 1605 AD to 1825 AD.
• The rise of the British power in the Eastern trade posed serious challenge to the
commercial interest of the Dutch leading to bloody warfare between them in which
Britishers were the clear winners owing to huge resources at their disposal.
• The brutal killing of some English traders by the Dutch in Amboyna in 1623 further
aggravated the situation.
• The Britishers one after another captured Dutch strongholds.
• In 1667, Dutch agreed to leave alone English settlements in India, while English gave
up all claims to Indonesia.
• Dutch commercial activities started to decline by the beginning of 18th century and
with the Battle of Bedera with the English in 1759 it came to an end.
Arrival of the British
• Arrival of the British and the establishment of British East India Company was
the outcome of the Portuguese traders who earn enormous profit by selling
their merchandise in India.
• Being motivated by the successful business stories of the Portuguese a group of
English merchants -‘Merchant Adventurers’ formed a company- the East India
Company in 1599 AD.
• The Company received a royal charter from Queen Elizabeth I on December 31,
1600 AD authorizing it to trade in the East.
• Queen was herself a share holder in the East India Company.
Expansion in West and the South
• Subsequently in 1608 AD, the East India Company sent Captain William
Hawkins to the court of the Mughal emperor Jahangir to secure royal
patronage.
• Then in 1615 AD, Sir Thomas Roe was sent by Emperor James I of England to
Jahangir’s court, with a plea for more concession for the Company and set the
factory at Surat.
• Roe was very diplomatic and thus successfully secured a royal charter giving
the Company freedom to trade in the whole of the Mughal territory.
• In 1616, the company established its first factory in South in Masulipatnam.
• In 1633, it established its first factory in east India in Hariharpur and Balasore
(Orissa).
Expansion in West and the South
• The company got the lease of Madras in 1639 and built Fort St. George in
Madras, which acted as its headquarter on the coromandal coast.
• Bombay was the main settlement of Company in West coast in 1668.
• Aurengzeb gave the company the farman in 1667 to trade in Bengal.
• In 1690, A factory was set up at Sutanati. In Sutanati and nearby villages of
Kalikata and Govindapur and grew the city of Kolkata.
• In 1696, the company fortified the Calcutta factory into Fort William.
• In 1717, John Surman obtained a farman from Farrukhsiyar which gave
large concessions to the company.
• This farman is called the Magna Carta of the company.
The Danish East India Company
• Denmark also established trade settlements in India.
• The Danish formed an East India Company and arrived in India in 1616.
• Important Danish settlement in India was Serampore in Bengal, it was also
their headquarters in India and Tranquebar (Tamil Nadu).
• They could not establish their position in India and finally sold all their
Indian settlements to the English in 1845.
• They were more concerned with missionary activities.
THE FRENCH
• The French East India Company was formed by Colbert under state
patronage in 1664 in the reign of Louis XIV.
• The French company was created , financed and controlled by the state
and is differed from the English Company which was a private commercial
venture.
• The first French factory was established at Surat by Francois Caron in 1668.
THE FRENCH
• A small village was acquired from the Muslim governor of Valikondapuram by
Francois Martin and Bellanger de Lespinay in 1673.
• The village developed into Pondicherry and its first governor was Francois
Martin.
• Also Chandernagore in Bengal was acquired from the Mughal governor in
1690.
• The French power in India declined between 1706 and 1720 which led to the
reconstitution of the Company in 1720.
• The French power in India was revived under Lenoir and Dumas (governors)
between 1720 and 1742.
• They occupied Mahe in the Malabar, Yanam in Coromandal (both in 1725) and
Karikal in Tamil Nadu (1739).
THE FRENCH
• The arrival of Dupleix as French governor in India in 1742 saw the
beginning of Anglo French conflict (Carnatic wars) resulting in their final
defeat in India.
• Duplex began the policy of extending territorial empire in India and
started political occupations, leading to series of conflicts with English in
form of Carnatic Wars.
• Battle at Wandiwash against the East India Company in 1760 was the
decisive battle for the French existence in India through which they lost
almost all their possessions in India.

Tripartite Struggle
for Kannauj
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Introduction
• Kannauj located in the central Gangetic valley
was a very important center for trade and
commerce.
• Hence obviously all the dominant dynasties
of the time fought for power and control over
this area.
• The dominant dynasties of this time were
Gurjara-Pratiharas, Palas and Rashtrakutas.
• Historians often describe this fight between
the three dominant dynasties of 8
thcentury as
the tripartite struggle.
Introduction
• Palas ruled the eastern parts of India and
Pratiharas dominated western India and
Rashtrakutas controlled Deccan regions of
India.
• The tripartite struggle ultimately ended in
favor of Nagabhata II, Gurjara –Pratihara
ruler.
Causes of Tripartite Struggle
• Kannauj was the erstwhile capital of Harshavardhana Empire in North India. The
following were the causes which provoked tripartite struggle,
• Kannauj was the symbol of prestige and power during early medieval period.
• Control of Kannauj also implied control of Central Gangetic valley which had plenty
of resources and thus it was both strategically and commercial important.
• This center was best for trade and commerce as it was connected to silk route.
How The Tripartite Struggle Begun
• The Pratihara ruler named Vatsaraja was very
ambitious about Kannauj.
• Similarly Dharmapala, the Pala ruler also
wanted to rule over Kannauj.
• And thus these two rulers were into a conflict.
• Vatsaraja defeated Dharmapala in a battle at
Gangetic Doab.
• And at the same time Vatsaraja was defeated by
the Rashtrakuta king Dhruva.
• Dhruva also defeated Dharmapala.
• Finally this pronounced enmity led to Tripartite
Struggle between Palas, Rashtrakutas and
Pratiharas.
Consequences of tripartite struggle
• After the attack by Dhruva, Dharmapala could
manage to get back control over his territory
and placed Chakrayudha on the throne of
Kannauj.
• But soon Nagabhata II, the successor of
Pratihara ruler Vatsaraja conquered Kannauj and
drove away Chakrayudha.
• Later Nagabhata II also defeated Dharmapala.
• The struggle for Kannauj became more severe
after the Nagabhata II exercised control over it.
Consequences of tripartite struggle
• During the rule of Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna III, there was
successful campaign against the Cholas.
• The Rashtrakutas also formed a matrimonial relationship
with other feudal kings.
• However, by the end of the 9
th Century the power of the
Rashtrakutas started to decline along with the Palas.
• And by the end of the tripartite struggle, the Pratiharas
emerged victorious and established themselves as the
rulers of central India.
• Note : Rashtrakuta empire lasted the longest, it was also
the most powerful empire of the three and acted as a
bridge between north and south India in economic as well
as cultural matters.
Palas
• Palas: Ruled in areas of Bihar and Bengal with capital at
Mongyr (Munger).
• The Pala dynasty came into power in Bengal in about the
middle of 8th century.
• Gopala: The death of Sasanka of Gauda created anarchy
and confusion in Bengal, whereupon the notable men of
Bengal elected Gopala as King in 750 AD.
• Gopala thus set up the pala Kingdom.
• Gopala was Buddhist and set up the Odantapuri Vihar
(modem Bihar Sharif).
Dharmpala
• Gopala was succeeded by his son Dharampala.
• Dharampala was defeated by the Rashktrakuta ruler
Dhruva –III who also defected the Pratihara ruler
vatasraja.
• But, Dhruva returned to the Deccan and Dharampala
accupied Kannauj but could not consolidate his control
over it as Pratihara power revived under Nagabhata II who
defeted Dharampala near Mongyr.
• During the reign of Dharmapala, he founded a famous
Buddhist Monastery at Vikramshila which was just second
to the Nalanda in fame for higher learning.
Devapala
• The son of Daharmpala succeeded him. He extended control over Prayag jyotispur
(Assam) and also part of Orissa and
• Some part of Vihara at Nalanda was constructed by Balaputradev, a Sailendera
ruler of Sumitra, Java and Malaya probably during his reign,
• During the reign of Devapala, the two kings of South east Asia established a
Monastery at Nalanda institution and seek Devapala to endow the income of five
of his village for the maintenance of the Monastery.
Pratiharas
• The Pratiharas are also called GurjaraPratiharas. The word Pratiharas literally means
the door-keepar.
• The foundation of one branch of Pratihara was
laid down by Harichandra, near modern
Jodhpur in the middle of 6
th century AD
• The foundationof 2
nd branch was at Malwa with
its capital at Ujjain and the earliest king of this
branch was Nagabhatta I.
Nagabhatta I
• He resisted the Arab invasions and acquired fame.
• He is the founder of this dynasty.
• He defended western India from Arabs. He extended the boundary of
Pratiharas up to Broach.
• He died in 760 AD and then was succeeded by his brother Kakustha and
then Devaraja.
• Both these rulers have no individuality or the charm of a king.
Vatsaraja
• Attempted to capture Malwa but was defeated by the Rashtrakuta ruler Dhurva III.
• He is the grandnephew of Nagabatta I
• Vatsaraja is the son and successor of Devaraja.
• He has been praised as a mighty ruler and distinguished Kshatriya.
• He is named as Ranahastin Vatsaraja in Kuvalayamala (composed in 778 AD), a
famous Jaina work.
Vatsaraja
• Vatsaraja defeated Bhandi clan represented by Indrayudha.
• Indrayudha exercised imperial power with the authority of Kannauj.
• He defeated Dharmapala with the help of Chahamana feudatory. But later he
suffered defeat in the hands of Rashtrakuta king Dhurva.
• Finally with this defeat Pratiharas lost their hold on Malwa region.
• Vatsaraja was forced to take shelter at Rajasthan.
• Consequently, Rajasthan became the center of the political activities of
Pratiharas.
Nagabhatta II
• He was a great conqueror.
• He defeated Dharmapala and captured Kannauj but was defeated by the
Rashtrakuta King Govind III.
• But Govind III Returned to the Deccan and so Nagabhatta II
again captured Kannauj.
• Nagabhatta II also came into conflict with devapala.
Mihirbhoja (836-885AD)
• Considerd the greatest ruler of Pratiharas.
• Arab travelers tell us that the Pratiharas had the best cavalry in India.
• They acquired horses from central Asia and Arabia as an import item of
trade.
• Bhoja used his horses well in military conquests.
• He was defeated by the pala ruler Devpala.
Mahendrapala
• Bhoja was succeeded by his son Mahendrapala I.
• He extended the empire into Magadha and North Bengal.
• His inscription have also been found from east Punjab, Awadh and
Kathiawar.
• He fought a battle with the king of Kashmir but had to yield to him some
of the territories in the Punjab won by Bhoja.
Mahipala
• Succeeded Mahendrapala I.
• He patronzed the poet Rajashekhar who wrote
Karpuramanjari, Kavyamiansa.
• Balaramayana and Bala and Bharata.

Types of Markets
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Markets Classification
• A variety of market structures will characterize an economy. Such market
structures essentially refer to the degree of competition in a market.
• There are other determinants of market structures such as the nature of the goods
and products, the number of sellers, number of consumers, the nature of the
product or service etc.
• Markets are classified into
 1) Perfect Competition
 2) Monopoly
 3) Monopolistic Competition
 4) Oligopoly
Perfect Competition
• In a perfect competition market structure, there are a large number of buyers and sellers. All
the sellers of the market are small sellers in competition with each other. There is no one big
seller with any significant influence on the market. So all the firms in such a market are price
takers.
• Specific characteristics of a perfect market are:
 Infinite (very large number of) buyers and sellers
 The products on the market are homogeneous, i.e. they are completely identical
 All firms only have the motive of profit maximization
 Zero entry and exit barriers Perfect factor mobility i.e. there are no barriers
 Perfect information
 Zero transaction costs
 Property rights
 And there is no concept of consumer preference
Monopoly
• A monopoly is a market structure in which a single supplier produces and sells a
given product.
• If there is a single seller in a certain industry and there are no close substitutes for
the product, then the market structure is that of a "pure monopoly".
• No close substitute or competition for a particular price, service or region.
• Marketing or Advertising cost is zero.
• Seller is the PRICE MAKER, Buyer is the PRICE TAKER.
• It can set any price it wishes since it has all the market power.
• Consumers do not have any alternative and must pay the price set by the seller.
Monopoly
• Monopoly firm can restrict output, raise prices, and enjoy abnormally high profits
in the long run.
• Of course, that does not happen in Indian Railways because of cross subsidization
of passenger fares for populism.
• Railway is a pure monopoly, but since it is for public good, it is desirable.
Monopolistic Competition
• Sometimes, there are many sellers in an industry and/or there exist many close substitutes
for the goods being produced, but nevertheless companies retain some market power. This
is termed monopolistic competition.
• There are MANY Buyers and MANY sellers.
• But they all do not sell homogeneous products. The products are similar but all sellers sell
slightly differentiated products. Each seller has slightly different version of product (iphone
vs Samsung Galaxy vs Oneplus) each with some loyal fans. So, a little change in price will not
instantly shift all buyers to another seller.
• Now the consumers have the preference of choosing one product over another. So, Seller is
the PRICE MAKER not Price TAKER (upto a level depending on brand loyalist fans)
• Most of the items we find in the grocery shops are part of monopolistic competition.
• For example, the market for cereals, toothpaste is a monopolistic competition. The products
are all similar but slightly differentiated in terms of taste and flavours.
Oligopoly
• An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number
of sellers.
• Because there are few sellers, each oligopolist is likely to be aware of the actions of the
others.
• MANY Buyers - Few sellers with identical product & but with intense competition among
themselves e.g. SpiceJet, Jet Airways, IndiGo, Vistara so price wars, discount-offers,
advertisement cost high.
• So in the case of an oligopoly, the buyers are far greater than the sellers.
• The firms in this case either compete with another to collaborate together, They use their
market influence to set the prices and in turn maximize their profits. Example OPEC
• So the consumers become the price takers.
• In an oligopoly, there are various barriers to entry in the market, and new firms find it
difficult to establish themselves.
• Duopoly= a market with just two firms. But if they form a cartel, then it’ll
become as if it’s ‘monopoly’.
• Cartel = when they form a gang to restrict the supply / raise prices e.g.
OPEC oil producing nations.
• A duopoly is a type of oligopoly where two firms have dominant or
exclusive control over a market.
• A commonly cited example of a duopoly is that involving Visa and
MasterCard, who between them control a large proportion of the
electronic payment processing market.
Monopsony
• A monopsony has only one buyer for a particular good or service,
giving that buyer significant power in determining the price of the
products produced.
• Buyer is the PRICE MAKER. Seller is the PRICE TAKER.
• Buying seats for railway; or Indian Army buying
Uniforms/Insignia/Machineguns.

Union and its
Territories
By – Dr. Vipan Goyal

Union and its Territory
• Article 1 describes India, that is, Bharat as a ‘Union of States’ rather
than a ‘Federation of States’. This provision deals with two things:
one, name of the country, and two, type of polity.
According to Article 1, the territory of India can be classified into three
categories:
1. Territories of the states
2. Union territories
3. Territories that may be acquired by the Government of India at any
time.
• Article 2 empowers the Parliament to ‘admit into the Union of India, or
establish, new states on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit’. Thus,
Article 2 grants two powers to the Parliament:
a. the power to admit into the Union of India new states; and
b. the power to establish new states.
• Article 3 authorises the Parliament to:
a. form a new state by separation of territory from any state or by uniting two
or more states or parts of states or by uniting any territory to a part of any
state,
b. increase the area of any state,
c. diminish the area of any state,
d. alter the boundaries of any state, and
e. alter the name of any state.”
*Note:
Article 2 relates to the admission or establishment of new states that are
not part of the Union of India.

Article 3, on the other hand, relates to the formation of or changes in the
existing states of the Union of India.

Introduction:
• The Indian Independence Act (1947) created two independent and
separate dominions of India and Pakistan and gave three options to
the princely states viz., joining India, joining Pakistan or remaining
independent.
• Of the 552 princely states situated within the geographical boundaries
of India, 549 joined India
• 3 (Hyderabad, Junagarh and Kashmir) refused to join India.

However, in course of time, they were also integrated with India—
• Hyderabad by means of police/army action,
• Junagarh by means of referendum and
• Kashmir by the Instrument of Accession

Linguistic Provinces Commission (Dhar Commission):
• There had been a demand from different regions, particularly South India,
for reorganization of states on linguistic basis.
• Accordingly, in June 1948, the Government of India appointed the
Linguistic Provinces Commission under the chairmanship of S K Dhar to
examine the feasibility of this.
• The commission submitted its report in December 1948 and
recommended the reorganisation of states on the basis of administrative
convenience rather than linguistic factor.
*Note:
This created much resentment and led to the appointment of another
Linguistic Provinces Committee by the Congress in December 1948 – JVP
Committee.
©StudyIQ Education
JVP Committee:
• It consisted of Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabh bhai Patel and Pattabhi
Sitaramayya and hence, was popularly known as JVP Committee. It
submitted its report in April 1949 and formally rejected language as the
basis for reorganisation of states.
*Note:
However, in October 1953, the Government of India was forced to create the
first linguistic state, known as Andhra state, by separating the Telugu
speaking areas from the Madras state. This followed a prolonged popular
agitation and the death of Potti Sriramulu, a Congress person of standing,
after a 56-day hunger strike for the cause.

Fazl Ali Commission:
• The creation of Andhra state intensified the demand from other
regions for creation of states on linguistic basis. This forced the
Government of India to appoint (in December 1953) a three-member
States Reorganisation Commission under the chairmanship of Fazl Ali.
• Its other two members were K M Panikkar and H N Kunzru.
• It submitted its report in September 1955 and broadly accepted
language as the basis of reorganisation of states. But, it rejected the
theory of ‘one language–one state’.
©StudyIQ Education
• It identified four major factors that can be taken into
account in any scheme of reorganisation of states:
(a)Preservation and strengthening of the unity and security of the
country.
(b)Linguistic and cultural homogeneity.
(c)Financial, economic and administrative considerations.
(d)Planning and promotion of the welfare of the people in each state
as well as of the nation as a whole.
©StudyIQ Education
The commission suggested the
abolition of the four
-fold
classification of states under the
original Constitution and creation of
16 states and 3 centrally
administered territories. The
Government of India accepted these
recommendations with certain minor
modifications. As a result, 14 states
and 6 union territories were created
on November 1, 1956.

Union Territory
By – Dr.Vipan Goyal

• Under Article 1 of the Constitution, the territory of India comprises three
categories of territories :
• A) Territories of the states
• B) Union Territories
• C) Territories that may be acquired by GOI at any time
• They are under the control of Central Government. Hence they are also known as
Centrally Administered Territories.
Union Territories
• At present there are 9 UTs( Previously they were 7 )
• Andaman and Nicobar Islands- 1956
• Delhi- 1956
• Dadra and Nagar Haveli- 1961
• Daman and Diu- 1962
• Puducherry- 1962
• Chandigarh- 1966
• Two union territories; Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh effective from 31 October
2019.
• Articles 239 and 241 in Part VIII of the constitution deals with Union
Territories.
• Every UT is administered by the President acting through an administrator
appointed by him.
• An administrator of a UT is an agent of the President and not head of the
state like a governor.
• President can specify the designation of an administrator, it may be
Lieutenant Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator.
• At present it is LG in Delhi, Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar Islands,
Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and administrator in the case of
Chandigarh, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Daman and diu and Lakshdweep.
• President can appoint the governor of the state as the administrator of
adjoining UT. In this, governor is to act independently of his council of
ministers.
• Parliament can make laws on any subject of the three lists ( including the
state list) for the UTs.
• But legislative assembly of Puducherry can also make laws on any subject of
the state list and the concurrent list.
• Similarly Delhi can also make laws on any subject except Public Order,
Police and Land.

The Universe
• Universe is all existing matter and space.
• Study of the universe is called Cosmology.
• Made up of 100 billion galaxies, each having 100 billionstars.
• Most scientists believe that the universe began about 13.8
billion years ago in what has become known as the Big Bang.
• This gigantic explosion caused matter to expand to form billions
of swirling galaxies and over the time, the stars and their
planets.
Galaxy
• Galaxy a system of millions or billions of stars, together
with gas and dust, held together by gravitational attraction.
• A galaxy is a huge mass of stars, nebulae, and inter-stellar
material.
• The smallest galaxies contain about 100,000 stars, while the
largest contains up to 3000 billion stars.
• Galaxies are the major building blocks of the universe.
Our Galaxy (Milky Way/AkashGanga)
• Milky Way galaxy of which our
solar system is a part
• Our galaxy has the shape of a flat
disc with a central bulge i.e. spiral
shaped
• Its diameter is about a 1,00,000
light years.
• Nearest galaxy is Andromeda.
Stars
• Clumps of dust and gas in nebulae come together
due to gravity and form stars.
• Stars are self luminous bodies which are made up
of hot burning gases.
Big Bang Theory and Expanding Universe
• The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological
model for the birth of the universe at
approximately 13.8 billion years ago (the age of the
universe)
• After the initial expansion the Universe cooled
sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic
particles, and later simple atoms.
Big Bang Theory and Expanding Universe
• The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang
were hydrogen, along with helium.
• Giant clouds of these primordial elements
later coalesced through gravity to form stars and
galaxies.
• According to this theory, the universe, ever since its
birth, is expanding in all directions uniformly.

Big Crunch
Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to
collapse.
It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state
similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.
What Are Redshift and Blueshift?
• Red shift and Blue shift describe
how light changes as objects in
space (such as stars or galaxies)
move closer or farther away
from us. The concept is key to
charting the universe’s
expansion.
Redshift and Blueshift
• When an object moves away
from us, the light is shifted to
the red end of the spectrum,
as its wavelengths get longer.
• If an object moves closer, the
light moves to the blue end of
the spectrum, as its
wavelengths get shorter.
Redshift and Blueshift
• Edwin Hubble (who the Hubble Space Telescope is
named after) was the first to describe the red shift
phenomenon and tie it to an expanding universe.
Star Formation/Stellar Evolution/Star
Life Cycle
Steps involved in a stars evolution, from its formation in a
nebula, to its death as a white dwarf or neutron star.
1.Nebula
2. Protostar
3. Red Giant
4. Supernova
5. White dwarf, Neutron Star or Black
Hole

Nebula
• A nebula is a cloud of gas (hydrogen) and
dust in space.
• Nebulae are the birthplaces of stars.
• Nebulae consist mostly hydrogen and
helium gas.
• Planetary Nebula are the outer layers of a
star that are lost when the star changes
from a red giant to a white dwarf.
Proto-star
• A Proto-star looks like a star
but its core is not yet hot
enough for fusion (fusion of 2
hydrogen atoms into a helium
atom with the liberation of
huge amount of energy) to
take place.
Protostar
• The luminosity comes
exclusively from the heating of
the Proto-star as it contracts.
• Proto-stars are usually
surrounded by dust, which
blocks the light that they emit,
so they are difficult to observe
in the visible spectrum.
Red giant
• It is formed during the later stages of
the evolution as it runs out of
hydrogen fuel at its centre.
• Red giants have diameter’s between
10 and 100 times that of the Sun.
• They are very bright, although their
surface temperature is lower than
that of the Sun
• Very large stars (red giants) are often
called Super Giants.
Red giant
• As the star condenses and it heats up
even further, burning the last of its
hydrogen and causing the star’s outer
layers to expand outward. At this
stage, the star becomes a large red
giant.
• But most stars are not massive
enough to create the pressures and
heat necessary to burn heavy
elements, so fusion and heat
production stop.
Supernova
• This is the explosive death of a star,
and often results in the star obtaining
with great brightness.
• The extremely luminous burst of
radiation expels much or all of a star’s
material at a great velocity, driving a
shock wave into the surrounding
interstellar medium.
• A great proportion of primary cosmic
rays comes from supernovae.
Supernova
• Supernovae can be triggered in one of two ways
• In the first case, a degenerate white dwarf may
accumulate sufficient material from a companion
to raise its core temperature, ignite carbon
fusion, and trigger runaway nuclear fusion,
completely disrupting the star.
• In the second case, the core of a massive star
may undergo sudden gravitational collapse,
releasing gravitational potential energy that can
create a supernova explosion.
White dwarf
• This is the last stage in the life cycle of a
star like the Sun.
• White dwarfs are the shrunken remains of
normal stars, whose nuclear energy
supplies have been used up.
• Fusion in a star’s core produces heat and
outward pressure, but this pressure is kept
in balance by the inward push of gravity
generated by a star’s mass.
• White dwarf = 1.44* size of the sun
Neutron star
• If the star is from 1.44
times to three times
bigger than the sun, it will
turn into a Neutron Star.
• Neutron stars are smallest
and densest stars known
to exist in the universe.
Pulsars
• Neutron stars rotate, and
can emit beams of
electromagmetic radiation
that are detected as Pulsars
Black dwarf
• The last stage of stellar evolution is a
black dwarf.
• A black dwarf is a white dwarf that has
sufficiently cooled that it no longer emits
significant heat or light.
• Stars having mass greater than three
times that of the sun, because of their
great gravitational power, contract so
much that they develop super density. It
is so dense that nothing can escape from
its gravity and hence called Black Hole
Life cycle
Solar System Formation –
Nebular Theory of Laplace (1796)
• Primordial matter existed in the form of a
gaseous mass called ‘nebula’.
• This mass started cooling down and in the
process lost some of its volume.
• Because of a reduced size, the rotational
speed of the nebula increased.
• This had a cascading effect as the
centrifugal force of its mass also
increased.
• As a result, the mass of the nebula
started concentrating along its equator.
Solar System Formation –
Nebular Theory of Laplace (1796)
• This mass was, on the other hand, being
pulled inwards by a gravitational pull.
• But, as the centrifugal force increased
further, some of the mass from the equator
separated from the main nebula in the
form of a ring which was also rotating.
• This ring, when cooled down and
condensed, gave rise to planets and subplanets, as it got broken into many smaller
rings.
• The remaining mass became the sun.
Drawbacks
• Fails to explain the revolution in the opposite direction by
some of the sub-planets of Saturn and Uranus.
• The theory fails to explain why only eight planets were
formed.

Celestial Bodies
• Celestial bodies are natural objects which is located outside of
Earth's atmosphere, such as the Moon, the Sun, an asteroid,
planet, or star.
• Some celestial bodies are very big and are made up of gases
and heat. They have their own heat and light which is emitted
in large amounts. These celestial bodies are called stars and
our Sun is a star.
SOLAR SYSTEM – THE UNIVERSE
• Our solar system consists of Sun + 8 Planets + 1 Dwarf planet
(Pluto) + No. of Natural Satellites
• Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet at 26th general assembly of
International Astronomical Union held at Czech republic in 2006
• Only sun has its own light, which is also the nearest star to the
earth
Components of the Solar System
Sun
Eight major planets,
Dwarf planets (Pluto, Ceres, Eris, makemake, haumea etc.),
Satellites and countless minor planets
Asteroids,
Meteors, and
Comets
Debris etc….
• Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a
mathematically predictive heliocentric system (Sun at
the center).

Sun
• Sun is located in arm of Milky Way galaxy.
• The Sun, which comprises nearly all the matter in the Solar
System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium.
• A body’s closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion,
whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its
aphelion.
Sun
• Age : About 5 Billion years
• Distance : 149.8 Million Kms
• Diameter : 1,38,400 Kms.
• Photosphere temperature : 5,770 K
• Core temperature : 150,000,000 K
Sun
• Rotation (as seen from the earth at the equator): 25.38 days
• Rotation (near the poles) : 33 days
• The sun consists of 71% of Hydrogen, 26.5% Helium and 2.5%
of other elements.
• The rays of the sun take about 8 minutes and 18 seconds to
reach the earth.
Sun
• Sun is the only star in our Solar System as it has its own source of
light and energy.
• Mass of the Sun accounts to 99.86% of our Solar System.
• Its average distance from the Earth is around 149,600,000 km.
• Sunlight takes about 8 min 18 secs to reach the Earth.
• Sun’s energy is produced by constant nuclear fusion in its core
through a series of processes called the p-p (proton-proton) chain.
This process converts Hydrogen into Helium.
Composition of sun
• Hydrogen → 74.9%
• Helium → 23.8%
• Metals → 1.3%
• Compared to the majority of stars in the Milky Way, the Sun
is rather large and bright.
• Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler
stars, known as red dwarfs, are common, making up 85% of
the stars in the galaxy.
Internal Structure – Atmosphere
• The solar interior, from the inside
out, is made up of the core,
radiative zone and
the convective zone.
• The solar atmosphere above that
consists of the photosphere,
chromosphere, and the corona.
• Beyond that is the solar wind, an
outflow of gas from the corona.


Core
• The core of the Sun has the highest
temperature and pressure among all
layers.
• The temperature of the core is
around 15 million degree Celsius – is
in ionized state called plasma
• The solar energy is produced in the
core by controlled nuclear
fusion process.
• The high temperature in the core
helps in removing the electrons from
hydrogen atoms and in creating
numerous electrons and protons for
nuclear fusion.
Radiative Zone
• The Sun’s radiative zone is the
section of the solar interior
between the innermost core
and the outer convective zone.
• In the radiative zone, energy
generated by nuclear fusion in
the core moves outward as
electromagnetic radiation.
Convective zone
• In this zone the density
of plasma is low.
• This zone transports hot
and light density fluids
from the core region of
high energy &
temperature to the
outer region of low
energy & temperature.
Photosphere
• The photosphere is the bright outer
layer of the Sun that emits most of
the radiation.
• The effective temperature on the
outer side of the photosphere
is 6000°K (11,000°F).
• This is the first visible layer of the Sun.
• The solar spots are formed on this
layer. The temperature of a solar spot
is around 4500 degrees.
Solar spots
• Solar spots : Temporary dark
spots formed when the magnetic
field bursts through the surface. It
can slow down the flow of
energy from the inside of the Sun
– that’s what makes the sun spots
cooler & darker than the
surrounding photosphere.
Chromosphere
• Just above the photosphere is
the chromosphere.
• It is relatively a thin layer of
burning gases.
• Chromosphere literally mean
as ‘sphere of colour’.
Sunspot
• A dark patch on the surface of
the Sun is known as sunspot.
• Sunspots appear as dark areas
because they are about 1500°
cooler than the surrounding
chromospheres.
Sunspot
• Each spot has a black center or
umbra, and a lighter region or
penumbra, surrounding it.
• Sun is 1% cooler when it has no
spot, and that this variation in
solar radiation might affect the
climates of the Earth.
Solar Wind
• Stream of energized charged
particles, primarily electrons and
protons flowing outward from
the sun at speeds as high as 900
km/s and at a temperature of 1
million degrees (Celcius)
• It is made of plasma.
Effects of Solar Wind
• As the solar wind approaches a planet that has a
well-developed magnetic field (such as Earth,
Jupiter and Saturn), the particles are deflected.
• This region, known as the magnetosphere,
causes the particles to travel around the planet
rather than bombarding the atmosphere or
surface.
• The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a
hemisphere on the side facing the Sun, then is
drawn out in a long trail on the opposite side.
Effects of Solar Wind
• The boundary of this region is
called the magnetopause, and
some of the particles are able to
penetrate the magnetosphere
through this region by partial
reconnection of the magnetic
field lines.
• The solar wind is responsible for
the overall shape of Earth’s
magnetosphere.
Solar flares
• The high magnetic fields in the
sunspot-producing active regions
give rise to explosions known as
solar flares.
• As solar flares push through the
corona, they heat its gas to
anywhere from 10 to 20 million K.
Solar Prominence
• An arc of gas that erupts from the
surface of the Sun.
• Prominences can loop hundreds of
thousands of miles into space.
• Prominences are held above the Sun’s
surface by strong magnetic fields and
can last for many months.
Corona
• A corona is a distinctive atmosphere of
plasma that surrounds the Sun and other
celestial bodies.
• The Sun’s corona extends millions of
kilometres into space and is most easily
seen during a total solar eclipse.
• This is the outermost layer of the Sun.
Aurora
• An aurora is a natural light display in the
sky, predominantly seen in the high
latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions.
• This is due to magnetic field lines of earth.
• Auroras are caused by charged particles,
mainly electrons and protons, entering the
atmosphere from above causing ionization
and excitation of atmospheric
constituents, and consequent optical
emissions.
Aurora Borealis and Aurora
Australis
• Aurora is referred to as polar
lights observed around the
magnetic poles in the northern
as well as in southern
hemispheres.
• It results due to collisions
between electrically charged
particles from the sun and the
earth’s atmosphere.
• These bright polar lights are
known as “Aurora borealis” in the
north and “Aurora australis” in
the south.

Planets
A celestial body
moving in an
elliptical orbit
round a star, the
Earth is known as
planet.
The planets are divided in the two groups
- Inner planets and Outer planets.
Inner planets -
Mercury, Venus, Earth,
Mars. These are also
known as terrestrial
planets or rocky
planets. These are
denser and have a
shorter periods of
revolution.
Outer planets -
Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, Neptune.
These are also known
as Gas Giants or
Gaseous planets. They
are big in size and
have a longer periods
of revolution.
Jupiter is the
biggest planet in
the Solar System
and Mercury is
the smallest.
• First four are called Terrestrial,
meaning earth-like as they are
made up of rock and metals, and
have relatively high densities.
• The terrestrial planets were
formed in the close vicinity of the
parent star where it was too
warm for gases to condense to
solid particles.
• The terrestrial planets are smaller
and their lower gravity could not
hold the escaping gases.
• The rest four are called Jovian or Gas Giant
planets.
• Jovian means Jupiter-like. Most of them are much
larger than the terrestrial planets and have thick
atmosphere, mostly of helium and hydrogen.
• The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but
many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects
follow highly elliptical orbits
• The solar wind was most intense nearer the sun;
so, it blew off lots of gas and dust from the
terrestrial planets
• The solar winds were not all that intense to cause
similar removal of gases from the Jovian planets.
Inner Planets
• The inner Solar System Composed mainly of silicates and
metals.
• They are composed largely of refractory minerals, such as
the silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and
metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores.
• Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and
Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate
weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface
features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes.
• The term inner planet should not be confused with inferior
planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the
Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).
Mercury
• Mercury is similar to the Moon with a surface dominated by craters
and a younger area of dark plains presumably made from floods of
lava.
• It is the planet nearest to the earth.
• Average distance to the Sun : 57.6 Million Kms.
• Diameter : 4,849.6 Kms.
• Period of revolution : 88 days
• Period of rotation : 58 days 15 hrs 30 mts. 34 sec.
Mercury
• Closest planet to the Sun.
• Orbits the Sun the quickest.
• No significant atmosphere.
• Rotation period is longer than its
orbital (revolution) period.
• No natural satellites (moons).
Venus
• Venus is often considered to be the Earth’s twin, but the
two planets are not identical.
• Venus has high plateaus, folded mountain belts,
numerous volcanoes, and relatively smooth volcanic
plains.
• The surface of Venus is totally obscured by a thick
atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with
clouds of sulfuric acid.
• It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety
times as dense.
• It is also known as the Morning Star or the Evening Star.
It is the brightest of all the planets.
Venus
• Diameter : 12,032 Kms.
• Period of revolution : 225 days
• Period of rotation : 243 days 14mts.
• Longest rotation period of any planet.
• Rotation period is longer than its orbital (revolution)
period.
• Hottest planet in the solar system.
• Revolves around the sun in clockwise manner while
most others are revolving in anti-clockwise.
• Second brightest natural object in the night sky (after
Moon).
• First planet visited by a spacecraft.
Earth
• The force of the Earth’s rotation makes the world
bulge very slightly at the equator and go a little flat
at the North and the South poles. So the Earth is
actually a flattened sphere, or a ‘geoid’. Or oblate
spheroid
• It is large enough to develop and retain an
atmosphere and a hydrosphere.
• The Pacific Ocean contains the deepest places on
the Earth’s surface-the ocean trenches.
• The very deepest is the Challenger Deep in the
Mariana Trench which plunges 11022 m into the
Earth’s crust.
Earth
• A ray of light from the sun takes about 8 mins 18 seconds to reach the
earth. Light takes only a second to reach us from the moon.
• Equatorial diameter : 12,756 Kms.
• Polar diameter : 12,714 Kms.
• Distance from the Sun : 149,597,900 Kms.
• Period of revolution : 365 days 5 hrs, 48 mts, 45.51 sec.
• Period of rotation : 23 hrs 56 mts. 4.09 sec.
• Only planet in the solar system to be known to support life.
• Has water in all three states – liquid, solid and gas.
Earth
• Gasses present in the earth’s atmosphere are
Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide
etc
• The Ozone layer present in the Earth’s
atmosphere protects it from the ultra violet
rays.
• Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth.

Definition of Planet
• The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined in August 2006
that, in the Solar System, a planet is a celestial body which:
• is in orbit around the Sun,
• has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly
round shape), and
• has "cleared the neighborhood" around its orbit.
• Among other things, this definition caused Pluto to no longer be a
planet, a change from how it had been widely considered until that
point.
Kuiper belt
• The Kuiper belt is a great ring of
debris similar to the asteroid
belt, but consisting mainly of
objects composed primarily of
ice.
• It extends between 30 and 50
AU from the Sun.
Other Solar System Objects
• Comets
 They are visitors of solar system.
 They are made of frozen gases (water, ammonia,
methane and carbon dioxide) which hold together
small pieces of rocky and metallic minerals
 A comet becomes visible when passing close to the
Sun, heats up and begins to outgas, displaying a
visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a
tail.
 These phenomena are due to the effects of solar
radiation and the solar wind upon the nucleus of the
comet.
Comets
• Its ice melts and the gas and dust is swept back
into a tail.
• The tail is always points from the sun. So when it
is travelling away from the sun, it is led by the tail.
• Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt
or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond
the orbit of Neptune.
• One of the larger comets is the Halley’s Comet.
The orbit of Halley’s Comet brings it close to the
Earth every 76 years. It last visited in 1986.
Halley’s Comet
• Halley’s Comet is arguably the most
famous comet.
• It is a “periodic” comet and returns
to Earth’s vicinity about every 76
years, making it possible for a
human to see it twice in his or her
lifetime.
• The last time it was here was in
1986, and it is projected to return in
2061.
Meteorite
• Meteor is a body of matter travelling at a great speed
through space which becomes luminous when enters into
the atmosphere (mesosphere) at about 200 km above the
Earth’s surface, because it is heated by friction. Generally,
this latter process dissipates the material into meteoric
dust.
• A meteor is popularly termed a ‘shooting star’ or ‘falling
star’.
• Largest Meteor Crater: A meteor crater in Arizona (USA) is
4,200 ft (1,300 m) deep is the largest meteor crater in the
world. It was formed over 10,000 years ago.
Meteorite
• Meteoroids are formed due to the
collisions between asteroids.
• They are fragments of rocks floating
about in space.
• Sometimes they come across earth
and fall into the earth’s atmosphere.
That’s when they become meteors
or “shooting stars”.
Meteorite
• Most of these meteors can’t reach earth’s
surface and burn up in the atmosphere
due to the friction with air.
• The meteors that do reach the earth’s
surface are known as meteorites.
• All meteorites are believed to be originate
in the asteroid belt, where a sudden
collision may send them towards the Earth
and the Earth’s gravity attracts them
towards the surface.
Constellations
• Different groups of stars form various patterns and they are called
constellations.
• These constellations were named in the honour of mythological
characters. Saptarshi (Great Bear/Ursa Major) is an example of
constellations.
• In ancient times, with the help of stars directions were determined
during night time. The North Star indicates the north direction (Pole
Star) and it remains in the same position in the sky.

The Universe
• Universe is all existing matter and space.
• Made up of 100 billion galaxies, each comprising an average of
100 billion of stars.
• Most scientists believe that the universe began about 13.8
billion years ago in what has become known as the Big Bang.
• This gigantic explosion caused matter to expand to form billions
of swirling galaxies and over the time, the stars and their
planets.
Big Bang Theory and Expanding Universe
• The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological
model for the birth of the universe.
• at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus
considered the age of the universe
• After the initial expansion the Universe cooled
sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic
particles, and later simple atoms.
Big Bang Theory and Expanding Universe
• The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang
were hydrogen, along with helium.
• Giant clouds of these primordial elements
later coalesced through gravity to form stars and
galaxies.
• According to this theory, the universe, ever since its
birth, is expanding in all directions uniformly.

Big Crunch
Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to
collapse.
It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state
similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.
What Are Redshift and Blueshift?
• Redshift and Blueshift describe
how light changes as objects in
space (such as stars or galaxies)
move closer or farther away
from us. The concept is key to
charting the universe’s
expansion.
Redshift and Blueshift
• Visible light is a spectrum of colors, which is clear to
anyone who has looked at a rainbow.
• When an object moves away from us, the light is shifted
to the red end of the spectrum, as its wavelengths get
longer.
• If an object moves closer, the light moves to the blue end
of the spectrum, as its wavelengths get shorter.
Redshift and Blueshift
• American astronomer Edwin Hubble (who the Hubble
Space Telescope is named after) was the first to describe
the redshift phenomenon and tie it to an expanding
universe. His observations, revealed in 1929, showed
that nearly all galaxies he observed are moving away.
Star Formation/Stellar Evolution/Star Life Cycle
Outlined below are the many steps involved in a stars evolution,
from its formation in a nebula, to its death as a white dwarf or
neutron star.
1.Nebula
2. Protostar
3. T Tauri Star
4. Main Sequence Star
5. Red Giant
6. Supernova
7. White dwarf, Neutron Star or Black
Hole

Nebula
• A nebula is a cloud of gas (hydrogen) and dust in
space.
• Nebulae are the birthplaces of stars.
• Nebulae consist mostly hydrogen and helium gas.
Protostar
• A Protostar looks like a star
but its core is not yet hot
enough for fusion (fusion of 2
hydrogen atoms into a helium
atom with the liberation of
huge amount of energy) to
take place.
Protostar
• The luminosity comes
exclusively from the heating of
the Protostar as it contracts.
• Protostars are usually
surrounded by dust, which
blocks the light that they emit,
so they are difficult to observe
in the visible spectrum.
T Tauri star
• A very young, lightweight star, less than 10 million
years old, that it still undergoing gravitational
contraction; it represents an intermediate
stage between a protostar and a low-mass main
sequence star like the Sun.
Main sequence star
• Main sequence stars are stars that are fusing hydrogen atoms to form
helium atoms in their cores.
• Most of the stars in the universe — about 90 percent of them — are main
sequence stars.
• The sun is a main sequence star.
• The faintest stars are the red dwarfs, less than one-thousandth the
brightness of the Sun.
• Towards the end of its life, a star like the Sun swells up into a red giant,
before losing its outer layers as a Planetary Nebula and finally shrinking to
become a white dwarf.
Red giant
• This is a large bright star with a cool surface.
• It is formed during the later stages of the evolution as it runs out of
hydrogen fuel at its centre.
• Red giants have diameter’s between 10 and 100 times that of the
Sun.
• They are very bright, although their surface temperature is lower
than that of the Sun
• Very large stars (red giants) are often called Super Giants.
• The most common red giants are stars nearing the end but are still
fusing hydrogen into helium in a shell surrounding a degenerate
helium core.
Red giant
• As the star condenses and it heats up even further, burning
the last of its hydrogen and causing the star’s outer layers to
expand outward. At this stage, the star becomes a large red
giant.
• Red giants are hot enough to turn the helium at their core,
which was made by fusing hydrogen, into heavy elements like
carbon. But most stars are not massive enough to create the
pressures and heat necessary to burn heavy elements, so
fusion and heat production stop.
Planetary Nebula
• A cloud of Gas and Dust.
• Planetary Nebula are the outer layers of a star that are lost when
the star changes from a red giant to a white dwarf.
• At the end of its lifetime, the sun will swell up into a red giant,
expanding out beyond the orbit of Venus. As it burns through its
fuel, it will eventually collapse. The outer layers will be ejected in a
shell of gas that will last a few tens of thousands of years before
spreading into the vastness of space.
Supernova
• This is the explosive death of a star, and often results in the
star obtaining the brightness of 100 million suns for a short
time.
• The extremely luminous burst of radiation expels much or all
of a star’s material at a great velocity, driving a shock wave
into the surrounding interstellar medium.
• A great proportion of primary cosmic rays comes from
supernovae.
Supernova
Supernovae can be triggered
in one of two ways
by the sudden re-ignition of
nuclear fusion in a
degenerate star; or
by the gravitational collapse
of the core of a massive star.
Supernova
• Nova: In the first case, a degenerate white dwarf may
accumulate sufficient material from a companion to raise
its core temperature, ignite carbon fusion, and trigger
runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star.
• In the second case, the core of a massive star may undergo
sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational
potential energy that can create a supernova explosion.
Nova
• Nuclear explosion on a white dwarf, which causes a sudden
brightening of the star.
• Novae are thought to occur on the surface of a white dwarf in a
binary system.
• If the two stars of the system are sufficiently near to one another,
material can be pulled from the companion star’s surface onto the
white dwarf.
• A nova is caused by the accretion of hydrogen onto the surface of
the star, commencing a runaway fusion reaction.
White dwarf
• This is very small, hot star, the last stage in the life cycle of a
star like the Sun.
• White dwarfs are the shrunken remains of normal stars,
whose nuclear energy supplies have been used up.
• White dwarf consist of degenerate matter with a very high
density due to gravitational effects, i.e. one spoonful has a
mass of several tonnes.
White dwarf
• Fusion in a star’s core produces heat and outward pressure, but this
pressure is kept in balance by the inward push of gravity generated
by a star’s mass.
• When the hydrogen used as fuel vanishes, and fusion slows, gravity
causes the star to collapse in on itself.
• Great densities are only possible when electrons are displaced from
their regular shells and pushed closer to the nucleus, allowing
atoms to take up less space. The matter in this state is called
‘degenerate matter’.
Black dwarf
• The last stage of stellar evolution is a black dwarf.
• A black dwarf is a white dwarf that has sufficiently cooled that
it no longer emits significant heat or light.
• Because the time required for a white dwarf to reach this
state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the
universe (13.8 billion years), no black dwarfs are expected to
exist in the universe yet. At the moment, they are strictly
theoretical.
Black dwarf
• A main sequence star that lacks the mass necessary to explode in a
supernova will become a white dwarf, a ‘dead’ star that has burned
through all of its hydrogen and helium fuel. But the white dwarf
remains hot for some time, much like a stove burner still emits heat
even when it has been turned off.
• After enough time has passed, all of the leftover heat will have
radiated away. No longer emitting heat or light, the white dwarf will
become a black dwarf
• However, the black dwarf would still retain its mass, allowing
scientists to detect the effects produced by its gravitational field.
Brown Dwarfs
• Brown dwarfs are objects which are too large to be called
planets and too small to be stars.
• Brown dwarfs are thought to form in the same way that stars
do – from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust.
• However, as the cloud collapses, it does not form an object
which is dense enough at its core to trigger nuclear fusion.
• Brown dwarfs were only a theoretical concept until they were
first discovered in 1995.
Neutron stars
• These stars are composed mainly of neutrons and are
produced after a supernova, forcing the protons and electrons
to combine to produce a neutron star.
• Neutron stars are very dense.
• Typical stars having a mass of three times the Sun but a
diameter of only 20 km.
• If its mass is any greater, its gravity will be so strong that it will
shrink further to become a black hole.
Black holes
• Black holes are believed to form from massive stars at the end
of their lifetimes.
• The gravitational pull in a black hole is so great that nothing
can escape from it, not even light.
• The density of matter in a black hole cannot be measured.
• Black holes distort the space around them, and can often suck
neighboring matter into them including stars.
Life cycle
Solar System Formation
• The Star Formation
 The distribution of matter and energy was not even in the
early universe.
 These initial density differences gave rise to differences in
gravitational forces and it caused the matter to get drawn
together. These formed the bases for development of
galaxies.
The Star Formation
 A galaxy starts to form by accumulation of hydrogen gas in
the form of a very large cloud called nebula.
 Eventually, growing nebula develops localized clumps of
gas
 These clumps continue to grow into even denser gaseous
bodies, giving rise to formation of stars.
Solar System Formation –
Nebular Theory of Laplace (1796)
• Primordial matter existed in the form of a
gaseous mass called ‘nebula’.
• This mass started cooling down and in the
process lost some of its volume.
• Because of a reduced size, the rotational
speed of the nebula increased.
• This had a cascading effect as the
centrifugal force of its mass also
increased.
• As a result, the mass of the nebula
started concentrating along its equator.
Solar System Formation –
Nebular Theory of Laplace (1796)
• This mass was, on the other hand, being
pulled inwards by a gravitational pull.
• But, as the centrifugal force increased
further, some of the mass from the equator
separated from the main nebula in the
form of a ring which was also rotating.
• This ring, when cooled down and
condensed, gave rise to planets and subplanets, as it got broken into many smaller
rings.
• The remaining mass became the sun.
Drawbacks
• Conservation of angular momentum could not be proved.
Although the sun’s mass accounts for 99.9% of the entire solar
system, the angular momentum of the sun is only 2% that of
the solar system.
• Fails to explain the revolution in the opposite direction by
some of the sub-planets of Saturn and Uranus.
• The theory fails to explain why only eight planets were
formed.
Galaxy
Spiral Galaxies Elliptical Galaxies
The Milky Way is an example of disc
shaped spiral galaxy which has
greater concentration of stars near
its center.
Star distribution is uneven.
Spiral galaxies are well supplied with
the interstellar gas in which new
bright, young stars form.
Most of their member stars are very
old and no new star forming in
them.
Galaxy
Spiral Galaxies Elliptical Galaxies
Smaller and less brighter The biggest and the brightest
galaxies in the universe are elliptical
The Milky Way and other spiral
galaxies consist of populations of old
stars in the center, and the youngest
stars located in the arms.
Non-uniform distribution of stars.

Galaxy
• Galaxy a system of millions or billions of stars, together with gas and dust,
held together by gravitational attraction.
• A galaxy is a huge mass of stars, nebulae, and inter-stellar material.
• The smallest galaxies contain about 100,000 stars, while the largest
contains up to 3000 billion stars.
• Galaxies are the major building blocks of the universe.
• From the billions of galaxies, two basic types have been identified:
1. Regular galaxies, and
2. Irregular galaxies.
Irregular Galaxies
The irregular galaxies comprise about one-tenth of all
galaxies.
The stars of the irregular galaxies are generally very
old.
Our Galaxy (Milky Way)
• Milky Way galaxy of which our solar system is a part
• Orion Arm The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm,
26,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way
• Our galaxy has the shape of a flat disc with a central bulge.
• Its diameter is about a 1,00,000 light years.
• In the nucleus the thickness reaches 10,000 light years,
whereas in the disc it is 500-2,000 light years thick.
Our Galaxy (Milky Way)
• We do not know exactly how far the Sun is from the center,
but it is conventionally taken to be 33,000 light years away.
Thus our solar system is relatively far from the galactic center.
• The entire galaxy is rotating in the space, although the inner
stars travel faster than those further out.
• The Sun which is about one-third out from the centre,
completes one lap of galaxy in about every 220 million years.
Our Galaxy (Milky Way)
• The nebula from which our Solar system is supposed to have been
formed, started its collapse and core formation some time 5-5.6
billion years ago and the planets were formed about 4.6 billion
years ago.
• Our solar system consists of the sun (the star), planets, satellites,
millions of smaller bodies like asteroids, meteorites and comets and
huge quantity of dust-grains and gases.
• Out of the nine planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are called
as the inner planets as they lie between the sun and the belt of
asteroids the other five planets are called the outer planets.
Our Galaxy (Milky Way)
• Alternatively, the first four are called Terrestrial, meaning earth-like
as they are made up of rock and metals, and have relatively high
densities.
• The rest five are called Jovian or Gas Giant planets.
• Jovian means Jupiter-like. Most of them are much larger than the
terrestrial planets and have thick atmosphere, mostly of helium and
hydrogen.
• The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets,
asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits
Why are the inner planets rocky while
others are mostly in gaseous form?
• The terrestrial planets were formed in the close vicinity of the
parent star where it was too warm for gases to condense to solid
particles. Jovian planets were formed at quite a distant location.
• The solar wind was most intense nearer the sun; so, it blew off lots
of gas and dust from the terrestrial planets. The solar winds were
not all that intense to cause similar removal of gases from the
Jovian planets.
• The terrestrial planets are smaller and their lower gravity could not
hold the escaping gases.
Celestial Bodies
• Celestial bodies are objects like Sun, moon, stars and others
that shine in the night sky.
• Some celestial bodies are very big and are made up of gases
and heat. They have their own heat and light which is emitted
in large amounts. These celestial bodies are called stars and
our Sun is a star.
• The sun, the moon and all those shining objects in the night
sky are called celestial bodies.
SOLAR SYSTEM – THE UNIVERSE
• Our solar system consists of Sun + 8 Planets + 1 Dwarf planet
(Pluto) + No. of Natural Satellites
• Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet at 26th general assembly of
International Astronomical Union held at Czech republic in 2006
• Only sun has its own light, which is also the nearest star to the
earth
• Only sun has its own light, which is also the nearest star to the
earth
Components of the Solar System

• Equivalent to 3,32,900 Earth masses.
• Compared to the majority of stars in the Milky Way, the Sun is
rather large and bright.
• Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars,
known as red dwarfs, are common, making up 85% of the
stars in the galaxy.
Sun
• Sun is located in Orion arm of Milky Way galaxy.
• The vast majority of the system’s mass is in the Sun, with most
of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter and Saturn.
• Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from a long way
above Earth’s north pole).
• Kepler’s laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of
objects about the Sun.
Sun
• A body’s closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion,
whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its
aphelion.
• Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts
for only about 2% of the angular momentum due to the
differential rotation within the gaseous Sun.
• The Sun, which comprises nearly all the matter in the Solar
System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium.
Sun
• Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise nearly all the remaining
matter, possess atmospheres composed of roughly 99% of
these elements.
• Those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by
heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high
melting points.
• Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of
materials with lower melting points.

• Age : About 5 Billion years
• Distance : 149.8 Million Kms
• Diameter : 1,38,400 Kms.
• Photosphere temperature : 5,770 K
• Core temperature : 150,000,000 K
• Absolute visual magnitude : 4.75
Sun
• Rotation (as seen from the earth at the equator): 25.38 days
• Rotation (near the poles) : 33 days
• The sun consists of 71% of Hydrogen, 26.5% Helium and 2.5%
of other elements. The rays of the sun take about 8 minutes
to reach the earth.
Sun
• Sun is the only star in our Solar System as it has its own source of
light and energy.
• Mass of the Sun accounts to 99.86% of our Solar System.
• Its average distance from the Earth is around 149,600,000 km.
• Sunlight takes about 8 min 17 secs to reach the Earth.
• Sun’s energy is produced by constant nuclear fusion in its core
through a series of processes called the p-p (proton-proton) chain.
This process converts Hydrogen into Helium.

only about 2% of the angular momentum due to the differential
rotation within the gaseous Sun.
• The Sun, which comprises nearly all the matter in the Solar System,
is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and
Saturn, which comprise nearly all the remaining matter, possess
atmospheres composed of roughly 99% of these elements.
Internal Structure – Atmosphere
• The solar interior, from the inside out, is made up of
the core, radiative zone and the convective zone.
• The solar atmosphere above that consists of
the photosphere, chromosphere, and the corona.
• Beyond that is the solar wind, an outflow of gas from
the corona.


Core
• The core of the Sun has the highest temperature and
pressure among all layers.
• The temperature of the core is around 15 million
degree Celsius – is in ionized state called plasma
• The solar energy is produced in the core by controlled
nuclear fusion process.
• The high temperature in the core helps in removing the
electrons from hydrogen atoms and in creating
numerous electrons and protons for nuclear fusion.
Radiative Zone
• The Sun’s radiative zone is the section of the
solar interior between the innermost core and
the outer convective zone.
• In the radiative zone, energy generated by
nuclear fusion in the core moves outward as
electromagnetic radiation.
Convective zone
• In this zone the density of plasma is low.
• This zone transports hot and light density
fluids from the core region of high energy &
temperature to the outer region of low energy
& temperature.
Photosphere
• The photosphere is the bright outer layer of the Sun that emits most of
the radiation.
• The photosphere is an extremely uneven surface.
• The effective temperature on the outer side of the photosphere is 6000°K
(11,000°F).
• This is the first visible layer of the Sun.
• The temperature here is around 6000 degree Kelvin (5370 degree Celsius).
• The solar spots are formed on this layer. The temperature of a solar spot is
around 4500 degrees.
Solar spots
• Solar spots → Temporary dark spots formed when the magnetic
field bursts through the surface. It can slow down the flow of
energy from the inside of the Sun – that’s what makes the sun spots
cooler & darker than the surrounding photosphere.
Chromosphere
• Just above the photosphere is the chromosphere.
• It is relatively a thin layer of burning gases.
• Chromosphere literally mean as ‘sphere of colour’.
• This layer is dominated by emission lines.
Sunspot
• A dark patch on the surface of the Sun
is known as sunspot.
• Sunspots appear as dark areas
because they are about 1500° cooler
than the surrounding chromospheres.
• The individual sunspot has a lifetime
ranging from a few days to a few
months.
Sunspot
• Each spot has a black center or
umbra, and a lighter region or
penumbra, surrounding it.
• It has been suggested that the Sun
is 1% cooler when it has no spot,
and that this variation in solar
radiation might affect the climates
of the Earth.
Solar Wind
• Stream of energized charged
particles, primarily electrons and
protons flowing outward from
the sun at speeds as high as 900
km/s and at a temperature of 1
million degrees (Celcius)
• It is made of plasma.
Effects of Solar Wind
• As the solar wind approaches a planet that has a well-developed
magnetic field (such as Earth, Jupiter and Saturn), the particles are
deflected.
• This region, known as the magnetosphere, causes the particles to
travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere
or surface.
• The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a hemisphere on the side
facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long trail on the opposite side.
Effects of Solar Wind
• The boundary of this region is called the magnetopause, and some of the
particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by
partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.
• The solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth’s
magnetosphere.
• Moreover, planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere are subject
to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind.
• Venus, the nearest and most similar planet to Earth in the Solar System,
has an atmosphere 100 times denser than our own, with little or no geomagnetic field. This is an exception.
Solar flares
• Produced due to magnetic anomalies.
• A magnetic storm on the Sun which appears to be a very
bright spot and a gaseous surface eruption.
• The high magnetic fields in the sunspot-producing active
regions give rise to explosions known as solar flares.
• As solar flares push through the corona, they heat its gas to
anywhere from 10 to 20 million K.
Solar Prominence
• An arc of gas that erupts from the surface of the Sun.
• Prominences can loop hundreds of thousands of miles into
space.
• Prominences are held above the Sun’s surface by strong
magnetic fields and can last for many months.
• At some time in their existence, most prominences will erupt,
spewing enormous amounts of solar material into space.
Corona
• A corona is a distinctive atmosphere of plasma that
surrounds the Sun and other celestial bodies.
• The Sun’s corona extends millions of kilometres
into space and is most easily seen during a total
solar eclipse.
• This is the outermost layer of the Sun.
• High temperature in this region gives it an unusual
spectral feature of a highly ionised ion.
• Chromosphere & corona are visible only during
formation of Diamond Ring during Solar eclipse.
Plasma
• One of the four fundamental states of matter, the others being
solid, liquid, and gas.
• Plasma is simply ionized gas [convert (an atom, molecule, or
substance) into an ion or ions, typically by removing one or more
electrons]
• Lightning and electric sparks are everyday examples of phenomena
made from plasma.
• Neon lights could more accurately be called “plasma lights”,
because the light comes from the plasma inside of them.
Aurora
• An aurora is a natural light display in the sky, predominantly
seen in the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions. [This
is due to magnetic field lines of earth]
• Auroras are caused by charged particles, mainly electrons and
protons, entering the atmosphere from above causing
ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents, and
consequent optical emissions.

Planets

Other Solar System Objects
• Comets
 A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to
the Sun, heats up and begins to outgas, displaying a visible
atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail.
 These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the
solar wind upon the nucleus of the comet.
 Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated
scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.
Comets
• Comets, composed of ice and dust, originated outside our solar system.
Their elliptical orbit brings them close to the Sun and into the inner Solar
System.
• Comets are among the most spectacular and unpredictable bodies in the
solar system.
• They are made of frozen gases (water, ammonia, methane and carbon
dioxide) which hold together small pieces of rocky and metallic minerals
• One of the larger comets is the Halley’s Comet. The orbit of Halley’s Comet
brings it close to the Earth every 76 years. It last visited in 1986.
Halley’s Comet
• Halley’s Comet is arguably the most famous comet.
• It is a “periodic” comet and returns to Earth’s vicinity about every 75
years, making it possible for a human to see it twice in his or her lifetime.
• The last time it was here was in 1986, and it is projected to return in 2061.
The comet is named after English astronomer Edmond Halley, who examined
reports of a comet approaching Earth in 1531, 1607 and 1682. He concluded
that these three comets were actually the same comet returning over and
over again, and predicted the comet would come again in 1758.
Halley’s Comet
• Tiny icy and rocky bodies that travel in highly
elliptical orbits around the sun.
• When they pass close to the sun, they water
and gases heat up.
• This leads to the formation of a tail behind the
rocky core in the direction opposite to the sun.
• Most famous comet is Halley’s Comet which
reappears every 75-76 years.
• Last appeared: 1986. Next appearance: 2061.
Meteorite
• Any solid debris origination from asteroids or comets or from outer space
that fall to the Earth, the Moon, or another planet in the solar system.
• Meteor is a body of matter travelling at a great speed through space which
becomes luminous when enters into the atmosphere (mesosphere) at
about 200 km above the Earth’s surface, because it is heated by friction.
Generally, this latter process dissipates the material into meteoric dust.
• A meteor is popularly termed a ‘shooting star’ or ‘falling star’.
• Largest Meteor Crater: A meteor crater in Arizona (USA) is 4,200 ft (1,300
m) deep is the largest meteor crater in the world. It was formed over
10,000 years ago.
Meteorite
• Meteoroids are formed due to the
collisions between asteroids.
• They are fragments of rocks floating
about in space.
• Sometimes they come across earth
and fall into the earth’s atmosphere.
That’s when they become meteors
or “shooting stars”.
Meteorite
• Most of these meteors can’t reach
earth’s surface and burn up in the
atmosphere due to the friction with air.
• The meteors that do reach the earth’s
surface are known as meteorites.
• There was a latest Meteor shower
named Geminid that was seen from
some parts of the world on 14th
December 2018.
Other related concepts
• Heliocentric vs Geocentric
 Heliocentric system is an astronomical model in which the
Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary
Sun at the center of the Solar System. [Remember the
name of the man who first suggested this model?]
 Geocentric model (Earth the centre) was proposed by
Ptolemy.
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion
• The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the
two foci.
• A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal
areas during equal intervals of time.
• The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to
the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
Why is Venus sometimes called Earth’s twin?
• almost the same size,
• have about the same mass (they weigh about the same), and
• have a very similar composition (are made of the same
material).
• They are also neighboring planets.
However, Venus and Earth are also very different
• Venus has an atmosphere that is about 100 times thicker than
Earth’s and has surface temperatures that are extremely hot.
• Venus does not have life or water oceans like Earth does.
• Venus also rotates backwards compared to Earth and the
other planets.
Mars Compared to Earth
• 53% the diameter of Earth
• 10% the mass of Earth
• surface gravity on Mars is only 38% the gravity on Earth
• A day on Mars lasts 1.03 Earth days
• axial tilt on Mars is 25.19 degrees. Very close to Earth’s 23.5 degree tilt
• a year on Mars lasts about twice as long as an Earth year, the seasons are
twice as long.
• The atmosphere of Mars is less than 1% the thickness of Earth’s
atmosphere. Furthermore, it’s made up of 95% carbon dioxide
Ecliptic Plane
• Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near
the plane of Earth’s orbit, known as the ecliptic. The
planets are very close to the ecliptic, whereas comets
and Kuiper belt objects are frequently at significantly
greater angles to it
Important fact
All the planets except VENUS and URANUS
rotate in anti-clockwise direction.
Earth’s Natural Satellite (Moon)
• Moon rotates around the earth in an elliptical orbit as
earth rotates around the sun
• Axis of moon is inclined at 58.4 * approx. wrt Plane
of ecliptic, as a result distance of moon from earth keeps
on changing
• Only 59 % of moon’s surface is visible from earth at the
max

Earth’s Natural Satellite (Moon)
• The moon is the only natural satellite of the earth.
• Neil Armstrong was the first man to step on the surface of the
moon on 29 July 1969.
• It is now generally believed that the formation of moon, as a
satellite of the earth, is an outcome of ‘giant impact’ or what is
described as “the big splat”.
• A body of the size of one to three times that of mars collided into
the earth sometime shortly after the earth was formed. It blasted a
large part of the earth into space.
Earth’s Natural Satellite (Moon)
• This portion of blasted material then continued to orbit the earth
and eventually formed into the present moon about 4.44 billion
years ago.
• Its diameter is only one-quarter that of the earth.
• It is about 3, 84,400 km away from us.
• The moon moves around the earth in about 27 days. It takes exactly
the same time to complete one spin. As a result, only one side of
the moon is visible to us on the earth.

Constellations
• Different groups of stars form various patterns and they are called
constellations. Saptarshi is an example of constellations.
• In ancient times, with the help of stars directions were determined
during night time. The North Star indicates the north direction (Pole
Star) and it remains in the same position in the sky.
• Celestial bodies that do not have their own heat and light and lit by
the light of the stars are called planets.

Curved Surface of Earth (Spherical form)
• Ship’s visibility → When a ship appears over the distant
horizon, top of the mast is seen before the hull & vice a versa.
Sunrise & Sunset
• Sun rises & sets at
different times in
different places. As
earth rotates from west
to east, places in east
see sun earlier than
those in the west.
Lunar eclipse
Shadow cast by earth on the moon during the
lunar eclipse is always circular
Driving poles on level ground on curved earth
• Engineers while driving poles of equal length at regular
intervals on the ground have found that they do not give a
perfect horizontal level.
• Centre pole normally projects slightly above the poles at
either end because of curvature of the Earth
• Hence they have to make certain corrections for this
inevitable curvature i.e. 8” to a mile
Aerial Photographs
Pictures taken from high altitudes by rockets &
satellites show clearly the curved edge of the earth.
This is perhaps the most convincing & up to date
proof of earth’s sphericity

VOLCANISM
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Volcanism
• A volcano is a vent in the
earth’s crust from which
molten rock material
(magma), explosive
bursts of gases and
volcanic ashes erupt.
Causes of Volcanism
• Volcanic activity is connected with crustal disturbances,
closely related with regions that have been intensely folded
or faulted.
• It creates convectional currents under the earth surface
which creates intense pressure and Magma will thrust
upward to the surface which cool & solidifies.
• If it occurs within crust as Plutonic rocks resulting in
intrusive landforms
• If it reach the surface & solidify, form extrusive landforms
Lava types in Volcanism
Andesitic or Acidic or Composite or Stratovolcanic lava
Basic or Basaltic or Shield lava
Andesitic or Acidic or Composite or
Stratovolcanic lava
• These lavas are highly viscous
• They are light-colored and have a high percentage
of silica.
• They flow slowly and seldom travel far before
solidifying. The resultant cone is therefore steep
sided.
• The rapid solidifying of lava in the vent obstructs
the flow of the out-pouring lava, resulting in loud
explosions, throwing out many volcanic bombs or
pyroclasts.
• The word andesite is derived from the Andes
Mountains in South America, where andesite is
common.
Basic or Basaltic or Shield lava
• These are the hottest lavas and are highly fluid.
• Rich in iron and magnesium but poor in silica.
• They flow out of volcanic vent quietly and
are not very explosive.
• They affect extensive areas, spreading out
as thin sheets over great distances before they
solidify
• Example : Deccan Plateau in India
Distribution of Volcanoes across the World
• Around 15% of world’s volcanoes are found along the
constructive or divergent plate margins and 80% are
associated with destructive or convergent plate boundaries.
• Maximum around the Pacific Ocean then Mid continent belt (
across the Mediterranean Sea, Alpine-Himalayan belt and in
the Atlantic and Indian Oceans) and then in Mid-Atlantic belt
Pacific Ring of Fire
• Circum-Pacificregion, popularly
termed the ‘Pacific Ring of
Fire’, has the greatest
concentration of active
volcanoes. Volcanic belt and
earthquake belt closely overlap
along the ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’.
• ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’ is
estimated to include twothirds of the world’s volcanoes.
Regions with active volcanism along
‘Pacific Ring of Fire’
• Aleutian Islands into Kamchatka,
Japan,
• the Philippines, and Indonesia (Java
and Sumatra in particular),
• Pacific islands of Solomon, New
Hebrides, Tonga and North Island,
New Zealand.
• Andes to Central America
(particularly Guatemala, Costa Rica
and Nicaragua), Mexico and right up
to Alaska.
Along the Atlantic coast
• St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean
• Cape Verde Islands in the central Atlantic Ocean.
• Canary Islands of NW Africa
• Volcanoes of Iceland and the Azores are active which is a
super-structural part of the Mid Atlantic Ridge, and marks the
boundary between the North-American Plate and the
Eurasian Plate and creates a north-south oriented belt of
seismic and volcanic activity.
Great Rift region
• In Africa some volcanoes are found
along the East African Rift Valley,
e.g. Mt. Kilimanjaro (in
Tanzania) and Mt. Kenya, both
probably extinct.
• The only active volcano of West
Africa is Mt. Cameroon (near the
Gulf of Guinea. )
Mediterranean volcanism
• Volcanoes of the Mediterranean
region are mainly associated
with the Alpine folds, e.g.
Mt. Vesuvius
• Mt. Stromboli : Because it has
been active for much of the last
2,000 years and its eruptions
are visible for long distances at
night, it is known as the
"Lighthouse of the
Mediterranean".
Mediterranean volcanism
• The volcanism of this broad region,
stretching from Spain to the
Caucasus, is largely the result of
convergence between the Eurasian
Plate and the northward-moving
African Plate.
• This type of volcanism is mainly
due to breaking up of
Mediterranean plate into multiple
plates due to interaction of African
and Eurasian plate.
Volcanoes in India
• There are no volcanoes in the
Himalayan region or in the
Indian peninsula.
• Barren Island is active volcano
in Andaman and Nicobar
Islands.
• Narcondam, is probably extinct
in Andaman and Nicobar
Islands.

• Keeps on ejecting volcanic material at frequent intervals
• Example –Mt. Etna (Italy),
• Mt. Stromboli (Sicily – largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, near Italy)
 Dormant Volcano
• One in which eruption has not occurred for a long time but can occur any time in future
• Mt. Mauna Kea in Hawaii
•
 Extinct Volcano
• No eruption has occurred in historic times & possibility of future eruption is also remote
• Mt. Popa (Myanmar).
• Vesuvius (Bay of Naples near Italy)
Volcanic Landforms
• Volcanic landforms are divided into extrusive and intrusive
landforms based on weather magma cools within the crust or
above the crust.
• Rocks formed by cooling of magma within the crust are
called ‘Plutonic rocks’.
• Rocks formed by cooling of lava above the surface are
called ‘Igneous rocks’.
• In general, the term ‘Igneous rocks’ is used to refer all rocks of
volcanic origin.
Extrusive Volcanic Landforms
• Extrusive landforms are formed from material thrown out during
volcanic activity.
• Some volcanos may have greatly enlarged depressions like cauldron
known as Calderas
• Volcanic dust or ash (finer particles) that emerges out of volcano
travels round the world & falls as black snow, which can bury house
& people.
• The coarser fragmental rocks are collectively called as Pyroclasts
which include cinders, pumice & volcanic bombs and dust and gases
such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor
amounts of chlorine, hydrogen and argon.

Intrusive Volcanic Landforms
• Intrusive landforms are
formed when magma cools
within the crust [Plutonic
rocks (intrusive igneous
rock)].
• The intrusive activity of
volcanoes gives rise to various
forms.
Batholiths
• These are large rock masses
formed due to cooling down
and solidification of hot
magma inside the earth These
are granitic
• Batholiths form the core of
huge mountains and may be
exposed on surface after
erosion.
Laccoliths
• These are large domeshaped intrusive bodies
connected by a pipe-like
conduit from below.
• These are basically intrusive
counterparts of an exposed
domelike batholith.
Lapolith
• It develops into a saucer shape,
concave to the sky body, it is called
Lapolith.
Phacolith
• A wavy mass of intrusive
rocks, at times, is found at
the base of synclines or at
the top of anticline in
folded igneous country.
Sills
• These are solidified horizontal lava layers
inside the earth.
• The thinner ones are called sheets while
the thick horizontal deposits are called
sills.
Dykes
• When the lava makes its way
through cracks and the fissures
developed in the land, develop a
wall-like structure and it solidifies
almost perpendicular to the
ground.
Conical Vent and Fissure Vent
• A conical vent is a narrow cylindrical
vent and are common in andesitic
(composite or stratovolcano)
volcanism leading to formation of
layers, and this makes the mounts
appear as composite volcanoes.
• A fissure vent, also known as a
volcanic fissure or eruption fissure,
is a narrow, linear volcanic vent are
common in basaltic volcanism.
Shield Type Volcanic Landforms
• These volcanoes are mostly made up
of basalt, a type of lava that is very
fluid when erupted.
• These volcanoes are not steep.
• They become explosive if somehow
water gets into the vent; otherwise,
they are less explosive.
• Example: Mauna Loa (Hawaii).
Caldera Lake
• After the eruption of magma
has ceased, the crater
frequently turns into a lake
at a later time. This lake is
called a ‘caldera’.
• E.g. Lake Toba, Indonesia,
the largest volcanic crater
lake in the world.
• Lonar in Maharashtra is an example of meteor crater lake and
not volcanic caldera.
Cinder cone
• A cinder cone is a steep
conical hill of loose
pyroclastic fragments, that
has been built around a
volcanic vent.
Geysers and Hot Springs
• Almost all the world’s geysers are confined
to three major areas: Iceland, New Zealand
and Yellowstone Park of U.S.A.
• Iceland has thousands of hot springs. Some
of them have been harnessed to heat
houses, swimming pools and for other
domestic purposes.
• Hot springs and geysers have become
tourist attractions e.g. in Japan and Hawaii.
Geysers
• A spring characterized by intermittent
discharge of water ejected turbulently and
accompanied by steam
• Examples include Iceland; New Zealand &
Yellowstone park of USA
• Under the influence of intense heat the
water in the capillaries and narrow roots in
the porous rock undergoes intense
expansion and gets converted to steam
resulting in high pressure.
Hot Springs
• A spring that is produced by the
emergence of geothermal heated
groundwater from the Earth crust
• Is more common than geysers
• The water rises to surface without any
explosion
• Such springs contain dissolved minerals
which may be of medical value
• Examples Include Iceland, Japan &
Hawaii
• The heat from the earth’s interior in areas of volcanic activity is used to
generate geothermal electricity.
• Countries producing geothermal power include USA, Russia, Japan, Italy,
New Zealand and Mexico.
• The Puga valley in Ladakh region and Manikaran (Himachal Pradesh) are
promising spots in India for the generation of geothermal electricity.

VOLCANOES
By Dr Vipan Goyal
Volcanism
• A volcano is a vent in the earth’s crust from which
molten rock material (magma), explosive bursts of
gases and volcanic ashes erupt..
or
• A mountain or hill having a crater or vent through
which lava, rock fragments, hot vapour, and gas are or
have been erupted from the earth’s crust.
Volcanism
Fissure Vent
• A fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure or eruption fissure, is a
linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any
explosive activity.
• The vent is often a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long.
Causes of Volcanism
• The chemical reactions of radioactive substances deep within the interior
of the earth generate tremendous amount of heat. Some heat is already
present in the form of residual heat (heat captured at the center during
earth’s formation) is already present at the earth’s interior.
• There is a huge temperature difference between the inner layers and the
outer layers of the earth due to differential amount of radioactivity. This
temperature difference gives rise to convectional currents in the outer
core as well as the mantle.
• The convectional currents in the mantle create convergent and divergent
boundaries.
• At the divergent boundary, molten, semi-molten and sometimes
gaseous material appears on earth at the first available opportunity
(the best available weak zone – usually a plate margin). The
earthquakes may expose fault zones through which magma may
escape (This happens in fissure type volcano).
• At the convergent boundary, the subduction of denser plate creates
magma at high pressure which will escape to the surface. Because
of high pressure, the magma and gases escape with great velocity
as the pressure is released through eruptions.
Lava types in Volcanism
Andesitic or Acidic or Composite or Stratovolcanic lava
Basic or Basaltic or Shield lava
Andesitic or Acidic or Composite or
Stratovolcanic lava
• These lavas are highly viscous with a high melting point.
• They are light-colored, of low density, and have a high percentage of
silica.
• They flow slowly and seldom travel far before solidifying. The resultant
cone is therefore steep sided.
• The rapid solidifying of lava in the vent obstructs the flow of the outpouring lava, resulting in loud explosions, throwing out many
volcanic bombs or pyroclasts.
• Sometimes the lavas are so viscous that they form a spine or plug at the
crater like that of Mt. Pelee in Martinique.

Basic or Basaltic or Shield lava
• These are the hottest lavas, about 1,000°C. (1,830°F.) and are highly fluid.
• They are dark colored like basalt, rich in iron and magnesium but poor in
silica.
• They flow out of volcanic vent quietly and are not very explosive.
• Due to their high fluidity, they flow readily with a speed of 10 to 30 miles
per hour.
• They affect extensive areas, spreading out as thin sheets over great
distances before they solidify (This is how Deccan Traps were formed).
• The resultant volcano is gently sloping with a wide diameter and forms a
flattened shield or dome.
Destructive Effects of Volcanoes
• Volcanism can be a greatly damaging natural disaster. The damage
is caused by advancing lava which engulfs whole cities.
• Showers of cinders and bombs can cause damage to life.
• Violent earthquakes associated with the volcanic activity and
mudflows of volcanic ash saturated by heavy rain can bury nearby
places.
• Sometimes ash can precipitate under the influence of rain and
completely cover whole cities.
Destructive Effects of Volcanoes
• In coastal areas, seismic sea waves (called tsunamis in Japan) are an
additional danger which are generated by submarine earth faults where
volcanism is active.
• The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people,
animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and
hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air
pollution downwind from a volcano.
• Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of
sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface
temperatures and promote depletion of the Earth’s ozone layer.
Positive Effects of Volcanoes
• Volcanism creates new landforms like islands, plateaus, volcanic
mountains etc.
• The volcanic ash and dust are very fertile for farms and
orchards.
• Volcanic rocks yield very fertile soil upon weathering and
decomposition.
• Although steep volcano slopes prevent extensive agriculture,
forestry operations on them provide valuable timber resources.
Positive Effects of Volcanoes
• Mineral resources, particularly metallic ores are brought to the
surface by volcanoes. Sometimes copper and other ores fill the gasbubble cavities. The famed Kimberlite rock of South Africa, source
of diamonds, is the pipe of an ancient volcano.
• In the vicinity of active volcanoes, waters in the depth are heated
from contact with hot magma giving rise to springs and geysers.
The heat from the earth’s interior in areas of volcanic activity is
used to generate geothermal electricity. Countries producing
geothermal power include USA, Russia, Japan, Italy, New Zealand
and Mexico.
Positive Effects of Volcanoes
• The Puga valley in Ladakh region and Manikaran (Himachal
Pradesh) are promising spots in India for the generation of geothermal
electricity.
• Geothermal potential can also be used for space heating.
• As scenic features of great beauty, attracting a heavy tourist trade, few
landforms outrank volcanoes.
• At several places, national parks have been set up, centered around
volcanoes.
• As a source of crushed rock for concrete aggregate or railroad ballast,
and other engineering purposes, lava rock is often extensively used.
Geysers and Hot Springs
• Almost all the world’s geysers are confined
to three major areas: Iceland, New Zealand
and Yellowstone Park of U.S.A.
• Iceland has thousands of hot springs. Some
of them have been harnessed to heat
houses, swimming pools and for other
domestic purposes.
• Hot springs and geysers have become
tourist attractions e.g. in Japan and Hawaii.
Geysers and Hot Springs
• Water that percolated into the porus
rock is subjected to intense heat by the
underlying hard rock which is in
contact with hot magma in the mantle
or the lower part of crust.
• Under the influence of intense heat
the water in the capillaries and narrow
roots in the porous rock undergoes
intense expansion and gets converted
to steam resulting in high pressure.
When this steam or water at high pressure finds a path
to the surface through narrow vents and weak zones,
appear at the surface as geysers and hot water springs.
Geyser Hot water spring
1. Steam or water at high pressure, along its
path, gets accumulated in small
reservoirs, fissures and fractures. Once
the pressure exceeds the threshold limit,
the steam bursts out to the surface
disrupting the water at the mouth. Hence
the name geyser.
2. Usually a carter like structure is created at
the mouth.
3. Silicate deposits at mouth gives them
their distinct colours
4. Found in very few regions. Iceland is
famous for its geysers.
1. Steam or water at high pressure
smoothly flows to the top through
the vent and condense at the
surface giving rise to a spring.
2. Usually a carter like structure is
created at the mouth of the spring.
3. Some springs are very colorful
because of the presence
of cyanobacteria of different
colors.
4. Found all across the world
Distribution of Volcanoes across the World
• Since the 16th century, around 480 volcanoes have been
reported to be active.
• Of these, nearly 400 are located in and around the Pacific
Ocean and 80 are in the mid-world belt across the
Mediterranean Sea, Alpine-Himalayan belt and in the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans.
• The belts of highest concentration are Aleutian-Kurile Islands
arc, Melanesia and New Zealand-Tonga Belts.
Distribution of Volcanoes across the World
• Only 10 per cent to 20 per cent of all volcanic activity is above
sea and terrestrial volcanic mountains are small when
compared to their submarine counterparts.
• Most known volcanic activity and the earthquakes
occur along converging plate margins and mid-oceanic
ridges.
• There is a strikingly close agreement between volcanic and
earthquake zones of the earth.
Pacific Ring of Fire
Pacific Ring of Fire
• Circum-Pacilic region, popularly termed the ‘Pacific
Ring of Fire’, has the greatest concentration of active
volcanoes. Volcanic belt and earthquake belt closely
overlap along the ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’.
• ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’ is estimated to include twothirds of the world’s volcanoes.
Regions with active volcanism along
‘Pacific Ring of Fire’
• Aleutian Islands into Kamchatka, Japan,
• the Philippines, and Indonesia (Java and Sumatra in particular),
• Pacific islands of Solomon, New Hebrides, Tonga and North Island,
New Zealand.
• Andes to Central America (particularly Guatemala, Costa Rica and
Nicaragua), Mexico and right up to Alaska.
• It is said that there are almost 100 active volcanoes in the
Philippines, 40 in the Andes, 35 in Japan, and more than 70 in
Indonesia.
Along the Atlantic coast
• In contrast, the Atlantic coasts have comparatively
few active volcanoes but many dormant or extinct
volcanoes, e.g. St. Helena, Cape Verde Islands and
Canary Islands etc..
• But the volcanoes of Iceland and the Azores are
active.
Great Rift region
• In Africa some volcanoes are found along the East
African Rift Valley, e.g. Kilimanjaro and Mt.
Kenya, both probably extinct. The only active
volcano of West Africa is Mt. Cameroon.
• There are some volcanic cones in Madagascar,
but active eruption has not been known so far.
The West Indian islands
• The West Indian islands have experienced some
violent explosions in recent times. E.g. Pelee.
• The Lesser Antilles (Part of West Indies Islands) are
made up mainly of volcanic islands and some of
them still bear signs of volcanic liveliness.
Mediterranean volcanism
• Volcanoes of the Mediterranean region are mainly
associated with the Alpine folds,
e.g. Vesuvius, Stromboli (Light House of the
Mediterranean) and those of the Aegean islands.
• A few continue into Asia Minor (Mt. Ararat, Mt.
Elbruz). The Himalayas have, surprisingly, no active
volcano at all.
Mediterranean volcanism
• The volcanism of this broad region,
stretching from Spain to the
Caucasus, is largely the result of
convergence between the Eurasian
Plate and the northward-moving
African Plate.
• This type of volcanism is mainly
due to breaking up of
Mediterranean plate into multiple
plates due to interaction of African
and Eurasian plate.
Other regions
• Elsewhere in the interiors of continents—Asia, North
America, Europe and Australia, active volcanoes are
rare.
• There are no volcanoes in Australia.
The Distribution of Earthquakes
• The world’s distribution of earthquakes coincides very closely with that of
volcanoes.
• Regions of greatest seismicity are Circum-Pacific areas, with the epicentres
and the most frequent occurrences along the ‘Pacific Ring of Fire.
• It is said that as many as 70 per cent of earthquakes occur in the CircumPacific belt.
• Another 20 per cent of earthquakes take place in the MediterraneanHimalayan belt including Asia Minor, the Himalayas and parts of northwest China.
• Elsewhere, the earth’s crust is relatively stable and is less prone to
earthquakes, though nowhere can be said to be immune to earth tremors.
Volcanos in India
• There are no volcanoes in the Himalayan region or in the Indian
peninsula.
• Barren Island, lying 135 km north-east of Port Blair became active
again in 1991 and 1995. After its activity in the nineteenth century,
it passed through a mild solfataric stage as evidenced by the
sublimations of sulphur on the walls of the crater.
• The other volcanic island in Indian territory is Narcondam, about
150 km north-east of Barren Island; it is probably extinct. Its crater
wall has been completely destroyed.
Extinct, Dormant and Active volcanoes
Extinct, Dormant and Active volcanoes
• Before a volcano becomes extinct, it passes through a waning stage
during which steam and other hot gases and vapours are exhaled.
These are known as fumaroles or solfataras.
• The Barren Island in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India,
Vesuvius (Italy) and Krakatao (Indonesia) which were thought to be
extinct, erupted recently and stayed active for few years and are
now in dormant stage.
• Krakatao volcano became active in 1883, killing 36,000 people in
West Java. Today, Krakatao is no more than a low island with a
caldera lake inside its crater.
Some significant Volcanic Eruptions
In the history of mankind perhaps the most
disastrous eruptions were those of
Mt. Vesuvius, Mt. Krakatau
and Mt. Pelee.
Mt. Vesuvius
• Vesuvius is a Stratovolcano (composite volcano) in Italy.
• Vesuvius, standing 4,000 feet above the Bay of Naples, erupted violently in
A.D. 79.
• The city of Pompeii, located to the south-west, was buried beneath twenty
feet of volcanic ashes cemented by the torrential downpours of heavy
rain.
• Fertility of the solidified Volcanic ashes tempted many farmers to begin
anew on the slopes of Vesuvius.
• Then came the catastrophic eruption of December 1631, ruined fifteen
towns and killed inhabitants.
Mt. Krakatau
• The greatest volcanic explosion known to men is perhaps that of
Mt. Krakatau in August 1883.
• Krakatau is a small volcanic island in the Sunda Straits, between
Java and Sumatra.
• The explosion could be heard in Australia, almost 3,000 miles away.
• Though Krakatau itself was not inhabited and nobody was killed by
the lava flows, the vibration set up enormous waves over 100 feet
high which drowned 36,000 people in the coastal districts of
Indonesia.
Mt. Pelee
• The eruption of Mt. Pelee of the West Indies in May
1902 was the most catastrophic of modem times.
• Pierre, the capital of Martinique, lying on the path of
the lava, was completely destroyed within minutes.
• Its entire population of 30,000 was killed almost
instantly.
Volcanic Landforms
• Volcanic landforms are divided into extrusive and intrusive
landforms based on weather magma cools within the crust or
above the crust.
• Rocks formed by cooling of magma within the crust are
called ‘Plutonic rocks’.
• Rocks formed by cooling of lava above the surface are
called ‘Igneous rocks’.
• In general, the term ‘Igneous rocks’ is used to refer all rocks of
volcanic origin.
Extrusive Volcanic Landforms
• Extrusive landforms are formed from material thrown out
during volcanic activity.
• The materials thrown out during volcanic activity includes lava
flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash and dust and
gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and
minor amounts of chlorine, hydrogen and argon.
Conical Vent and Fissure Vent
• A conical vent is a narrow cylindrical vent through which magma
flows out violently. Conical vents are common in andesitic
(composite or stratovolcano) volcanism.
• A fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure or eruption fissure,
is a narrow, linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually
without any explosive activity. The vent is often a few meters wide
and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents are common in
basaltic volcanism.

Mid-Ocean Ridges
• These volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas. There is a
system of mid-ocean ridges more than 70,000 km long that
stretches through all the ocean basins. The central portion
of this ridge experiences frequent eruptions.
• The lava is basaltic in nature (Less silica and hence less
viscous).
• Cools slowly and flows through longer distances.
• The lava here is responsible for see floor spreading.
Composite Type Volcanic Landforms
• They are conical or central type volcanic
landforms.
• Along with andesitic lava, large quantities of
pyroclastic material and ashes find their way
to the ground.
• Andesitic lava along with pyroclastic material
accumulates in the vicinity of the vent
openings leading to formation of layers, and
this makes the mounts appear as composite
volcanoes.
Composite Type Volcanic Landforms
• The highest and most common
volcanoes have composite cones.
• They are often called strato –
volcanoes.
• Stromboli ‘Lighthouse of the
Mediterranean’, Mt. Vesuvius, Mt.
Fuji etc. are examples.
Shield Type Volcanic Landforms
• The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most
famous examples.
• These volcanoes are mostly made up of
basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid
when erupted.
• These volcanoes are not steep.
• They become explosive if somehow water
gets into the vent; otherwise, they are less
explosive.
• Example: Mauna Loa (Hawaii).
Fissure Type Flood Basalt Landforms
[Lava Plateaus]
• Sometimes, a very thin magma escapes through cracks
and fissures in the earth’s surface and flows after
intervals for a long time, spreading over a vast area,
finally producing a layered, undulating (wave like), flat
surface.
• Example: Deccan traps (peninsular India), Snake Basin,
U.S.A, Icelandic Shield, Canadian Shield etc..
Caldera Lake
• After the eruption of magma has
ceased, the crater frequently
turns into a lake at a later time.
This lake is called a ‘caldera’.
• E.g. Lake Toba, Indonesia, the
largest volcanic crater lake in the
world. Crater Lake in Oregon,
USA.
• Lonar in Maharashtra is an example of meteor crater lake and
not volcanic caldera.
Cinder cone
• A cinder cone is a steep
conical hill of loose
pyroclastic fragments, such
as either volcanic clinkers,
cinders, volcanic ash, or
scoria that has been built
around a volcanic vent.
Intrusive Volcanic Landforms
• Intrusive landforms are
formed when magma cools
within the crust [Plutonic
rocks (intrusive igneous
rock)].
• The intrusive activity of
volcanoes gives rise to various
forms.

Batholiths
• These are large rock masses formed due to cooling down and
solidification of hot magma inside the earth.
• They appear on the surface only after the denudation
processes remove the overlying materials.
• Batholiths form the core of huge mountains and may be
exposed on surface after erosion.
• These are granitic
Laccoliths
• These are large dome-shaped intrusive bodies
connected by a pipe-like conduit from below.
• These are basically intrusive counterparts of an
exposed domelike batholith.
• The Karnataka plateau is spotted with dome hills
of granite rocks. Most of these, now exfoliated,
are examples of laccoliths or batholiths.
Lapolith
• As and when the lava moves upwards, a portion of the same
may tend to move in a horizontal direction wherever it finds a
weak plane. It may get rested in different forms. In case it
develops into a saucer shape, concave to the sky body, it is
called Lapolith.
Phacolith
• A wavy mass of intrusive rocks, at times, is found at
the base of synclines or at the top of anticline in
folded igneous country.
• Such wavy materials have a definite conduit to
source beneath in the form of magma chambers
(subsequently developed as batholiths). These are
called the Phacoliths.
Sills
• These are solidified horizontal lava layers inside the
earth.
• The near horizontal bodies of the intrusive igneous
rocks are called sill or sheet, depending on the
thickness of the material.
• The thinner ones are called sheets while the thick
horizontal deposits are called sills.
Dykes
• When the lava makes its way through cracks and the fissures
developed in the land, it solidifies almost perpendicular to the
ground.
• It gets cooled in the same position to develop a wall-like structure.
Such structures are called dykes.
• These are the most commonly found intrusive forms in the western
Maharashtra area. These are considered the feeders for the
eruptions that led to the development of the Deccan traps.
Basically, four types of volcanism can be identified.
• Exhalative (vapor or fumes)
• Effusive (Lava outpouring)
• Explosive (Violent ejection solid material)
• Subaqueous Volcanism
Exhalative (vapor or fumes)
• This includes the discharge of
material in gaseous form,
 steam, fumes and
 Hydrochloric acid
 Ammonium chloride
 Sulphur dioxide
 Carbon dioxide
 Carbon monoxide.
 Hydrogen sulphide
 Hydrogen
 Nitrogen
Exhalative (vapor or fumes)
• These gases may escape through
vents which are in the form of hot
springs, geysers, fumaroles and
solfataras.
• This kind of volcanism indicates
the volcano is reaching its
• Associated landforms ==> sinter
mounds, cones of precipitated
minerals and mud volcanoes.
Exhalative (vapor or fumes)
Effusive (Lava outpouring)
• Effusive: Geology relating to or
denoting igneous rocks poured out
as lava and later solidified.
• This type of activity refers
to abundant outpourings of
lava from a vent or fissure.
• Lava is silica poor basic one
like basalt. Hence flows through
larger distances.
Effusive (Lava outpouring)
• The Deccan traps, which are
composed of such lavas today,
cover an area of 5,00,000 square
km. The original extent of the
formation must have been at
least 14 lakh square km.
• Columnar structure is sometimes
developed in fine-grained plateau
basalts.
• Columnar basalts are seen in the
Deccan traps near Bombay.
Explosive (Violent ejection of
solid material)
• This type of activity results in fragmentation and ejection of solid
material through vents.
• Volcanic eject that settle out of air or water are sometimes called
pyroclastic sediments.
• Tephra: all fragmented ejects from the volcanoes.
• Ash: The finest sand-sized tephra
• Lappilli: These are gravel sized particles either in molten or solid
state.
• Blocks: Cobble or boulder-sized solid ejecta.
Explosive (Violent ejection of
solid material)
• Bombs: a lump of lava thrown out by a volcano.
• Tuff: Layers of volcanic dust and ashes
• Smaller particles like lapilli and ash travel through air for many
kilometres and may remain suspended in the air for a long
time.
• The heavier particles like bombs and blocks fall only as far
from the vent or fissure as the explosive force is able to hurl
them.

Volcanism – Acid Rain and Ozone
Destruction
• The volcanic gases that pose the
greatest potential hazard to
people, animals, agriculture, and
property are sulfur dioxide, carbon
dioxide, and hydrogen fluoride
etc..
• Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead
to acid rain and air pollution
downwind from a volcano.
Volcanism – Acid Rain and Ozone
Destruction
• Globally, large explosive
eruptions that inject a
tremendous volume of
sulfur aerosols into the
stratosphere can lead to
lower surface temperatures
and promote depletion of
the Earth’s ozone layer.
Subaqueous Volcanism
• This type of volcanic activity
takes places below the
surface of water.
• When lava flows over the
deep ocean floor or is
otherwise in contact with
water, it consolidates to
produce a structure like that
of a heap of pillows
Subaqueous Volcanism
• Pillow lava of Pre-Cambrian
Age are found in parts of
Karnataka.
• Highly viscous lavas erupted
at lesser depths develop
glassy margins on pillows. The
related volcanic product is
hyaloclastite. Most
hyaloclastites identified are in
Iceland.
Eruptive Volcanism Types
Based on the typical pattern or mode of eruptions:
• Hawaiian Eruption or Icelandic Eruption
• Strombolian Eruption
• Vulcanian Eruption
• Pelean Eruption
• Icelandic volcano

Hawaiian Eruption or Icelandic Eruption
• It involves the effusive outpouring of basalt
lava from craters, lava lakes or fissures.
• A single flow spreads widely over open slopes or
flows down the valleys as lava rivers.
• Little gas or tephra is produced.
• Examples: The great basalt plateaus of Columbia
and Iceland.
Strombolian Eruption
• In this case, more viscous lava is ejected upward
in a fountain like fashion from a lava lake in the
crater at regular intervals of around 15 minutes.
• Stromboli lies in the Lipari Islands near Italy.
• It is called the ‘lighthouse of the Mediterranean’.
Vulcanian Eruption
• The eruption in this mode is
• The molten lava which fills the crater solidifies and is explosively
ejected as a great cauliflower cloud of dark tephra.
• Bombs, blocks, lapilli and other ejecta fall in the surrounding area.
• Only minor lava flows result.
• After each eruption cycle, the volcano is dormant for decades or for
centuries.
Pelean Eruption
• This type of eruption is the result of very viscous,
gas-rich, acidic lava flowing violently over the crater
rim or breaking out laterally.
• Hot gas and lava mixture is not carried skyward to
become cold tephra but spreads downslope as
a nuce ardente, continuing to evolve gas that
cushions the flowing fragments.
Icelandic volcano
• The Icelandic type is characterized by effusions of
molten basaltic lava that flow from long, parallel
fissures. Such outpourings often build lava plateaus.

Desai-Liaqat Pact (January 1945)
 Bhulabhai Desai, leader of the Congress with Liaqat Ali Khan, leader of the
Muslim drafted a proposal for the formation of an interim government at the
centre, consisting of -
 an equal number of persons nominated by the Congress & League in the central
legislature.
 20% reserved seats for minorities.
 No settlement could be reached between the Congress and the League officially
on these lines. – FAILED
Wavell Plan
 A conference was convened by the viceroy -Lord Wavell at Shimla on 25th June 1945
 Aimed to reconstruct the governor general’s executive council pending the
preparation of a new constitution.
 Representatives of all groups participated
* The Viscount Wavell - October 1943 - 21 February 1947

Main Proposals
 With the exception of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief, all
members of the executive council were to be Indians.
 Hindus and Muslims were to have equal representation in executive council.
 The reconstructed council was to function as an interim government within the
framework of the 1935 Act (i.e. not responsible to the Central Assembly).
 Governor- General was to exercise his veto on the advice of ministers.
 Representatives of different parties were, to submit a joint list to the viceroy for
nominations to the executive council.
 If a joint list was not possible, then separate lists were to be submitted.
Jinnah said that only Muslim league has right to represent Muslims of India
and congress or any other non-league entity does not represent Muslims.
Congress had no right to nominate any Muslim in executive council.
He also demanded that in case of the division of votes and objection by the
Muslim members, there should be a provision that vote is cleared only by
2/3rd of majority.
Veto given to Muslim members of executive council
Maulana Abul Kalam azad firmly opposed the plan –
‘’INC would be betraying its Muslim supporters if this plan is adopted’’
Wavell plan created two platforms - It made Muslim league representative of
Muslims in India. Jinnah’s status was raised to equal of Gandhi and two
representatives were created for the first time – one for India and the other
for Pakistan.

Wind Systems
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Wind Systems
• Wind is the horizontal movement of air caused by:
• Heating by the Sun
• Rotation of earth on its axis
• The formation of the wind system begins with the sun’s radiation,
which is absorbed differently on the earth’s surface.
• The earth’s surface is heated differently because of scenarios like
cloud cover, mountains, valleys, water bodies, vegetation and
desert lands.
• Air on surfaces with higher temperatures will then begin to rise
because it is lighter (less dense).
• As the air rises, it creates low atmospheric pressure.
• Air on surfaces with cooler temperatures sink (do not rise).
• The sinking creates higher atmospheric pressure. This behaviour or warm gases or
liquids moving upward and being replaced by cooler particles is called Convection.
• The energy moving during convection is called convectional current.
• Anywhere and each time there are differences in atmospheric (air) pressure, there
will be winds, because air will move from the high pressure area to the low
pressure area.
• It also means that winds may be even stronger where the difference in the air
pressure is greater.
• A good example is how a tropical depression forms, where warm air over hot
tropical waters rise, and high pressure cold air quickly rushing to fill the space.
Factors affecting Wind Movement
• The wind at the surface experiences friction. In addition, rotation of
the earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the
rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force.
• Thus, the horizontal winds near the earth surface respond to the
combined effect of three forces – the pressure gradient force,
the frictional force and the Coriolis force.
• In addition, the gravitational force acts downwards. Centripetal
acceleration produces a circular pattern of flow around centers of
high and low pressure.
Planetary Winds
• Planetary winds are also known as
permanent or prevailing winds.
• Blow from high to low pressure,
over the earth surface & oceans
throughout the year & in a
particular direction.
• These winds are divided into 3
categories viz.
• Trade Winds (Tropical Easterlies)
• Westerlies
• Polar winds (Polar Easterlies)
General circulation of the atmosphere
• The pattern of planetary winds depend on:
 latitudinal variation of atmospheric heating;
 emergence of pressure belts;
 the distribution of continents and oceans;
 the rotation of earth
 The pattern of the movement of the
planetary winds is called the general
circulation of the atmosphere. The general
circulation of the atmosphere also sets in
motion the ocean water circulation which
influences the earth’s climate.
Trade winds
• Trades wind blow out from the Subtropical High
Pressure belts. In the northern hemisphere, they blow
towards the equatorial low and called North East Trade
Winds. In the Southern hemisphere they blow towards
the equatorial low and become the South East Trade
winds.
• The trade winds are most regular winds of all kinds on
earth. They blow with great force and in constant
direction that is why they are preferred by the sailors.
• The trade winds bring heavy rain falls.
• Absent in N Indian Ocean which is dominated by
Monsoon winds.
Trade winds and Hadley cell
• There are three primary circulation cells on earth known as the
Hadley cell, Ferrel cell, and Polar cell.
• The Hadley cell mechanism provides an explanation for the trade
winds.
• The air at the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) rises
because of the convection currents caused by low pressure. Low
pressure in turn occurs due to high insolation. The winds from the
tropics converge at this low pressure zone.
• The converged air rises along with the convective cell. It reaches
the top of the troposphere up to an altitude of 14 km, and moves
towards the poles. This causes accumulation of air at about 30° N
and S.
• At about 30°N/S latitude, it descends in a high pressure area.
Some of the descending air travels equatorially along the surface,
closing the loop of the Hadley cell and creating the Trade Winds.
Trade winds and Hadley cell
• But it is deflected in both hemispheres by the Coriolis
Effect, these winds are called the northeast trade winds
in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeast trade
winds in the Southern Hemisphere. The trade winds
meet at the doldrums.
• Hadley Cells is described to be lying on equator but it
follows sun’s zenith point, or what is termed the
“thermal equator”.
• This makes it one of the most famous tourist
destinations of the world. What make such a climate are
Trade Winds.
Westerlies and Ferrel Cell
• Westerlies blow in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60
degrees latitude, and originate from the high pressure area in
the horse latitudes towards the poles.
• At the surface these winds are called westerlies and its
direction is opposite to trade winds and so called anti trade
winds and the cell is known as the Ferrel cell.
• Under the effect of the Coriolis force, they become the south
westerlies in the northern hemisphere and Northern westerlies
in the southern hemisphere.
• In the southern hemisphere, there is more of ocean and less of
land in comparison to the northern hemisphere. Due to this
reason, the westerlies blow with much greater force in
southern hemisphere in comparison to northern hemisphere.
This also has implications in the Ocean currents.
• The velocity of the westerlies is given different terms as
follows:
• Roaring Forties between the 40-50°S
• Furious Fifties at the 50°S and Shrieking Sixties at 60°S.
• Westerlies are also associated with the “extra tropical”
cyclones which refer to the fact that this type of cyclone
generally occurs outside of the tropics, in the middle
latitudes of the planet, where the Westerlies steer the
system generally from west to east.
• Whenever there is a convergence of the cold and denser
polar winds and warm and light westerlies, there are much
variation in the weather.
Pressure and Wind: Geostrophic Wind
• Strong corolis force at tropopause.
• Because Friction is less and high speed
and stronger the corolis force. And
deflected 90 degrees.
• The resultant balance between the
pressure force and the Coriolis force is
such that, in the absence of surface
friction, air moves parallel to isobars
(lines of equal pressure). This is called
the geotropic wind.
• Northern-Hemisphere: Geostrophic
deflect clockwise
• Southern-Hemisphere: Geostrophic
deflect anticlockwise
• The upper tropospheric / geostrophic
winds blow from west to east at very
high speed.
• So called upper tropopheric westerlies.
Rossby Waves
• Westerlies at poles- to maintain the angular
momentum they meandes and are called Rossby
Waves.
• Rossby waves are natural phenomenon in the
atmosphere and oceans due to rotation of earth.
• Rossby waves are formed when polar air moves
toward the Equator while tropical air is moving
poleward.
• The existence of these waves explains the lowpressure cells (cyclones) and high-pressure
cells (anticyclones).
• Rossby waves do not meander consistenly, but
follow a cycle and is called Index Cycle
Polar Cell
• Polar easterlies blow from the polar high pressure belts
towards the temperate low pressure belts.
• These are extremely cold winds that come from the
Tundra and Icecap regions of the poles.
• The Polar Easterlies are more regular in the southern
hemisphere in comparison to the northern hemisphere.
(Oceans in turn provide input of energy and water
vapour into the air. )
• These polar cold winds converge with the warm
easterlies near 60° latitudes and form the Polar front or
Mid Latitude front.
• This mid-latitude front becomes the centre of the origin
of the Temperate Cyclones.
Classification of Winds
• Permanent winds or Primary winds or Prevailing winds or Planetary Winds
• The trade winds, westerlies and easterlies.
• Secondary or Periodic Winds
 Seasonal winds: These winds change their direction in different
seasons. For example monsoons in India.
 Periodic winds: Land and sea breeze, mountain and valley breeze.
Valley Breeze and Mountain Breeze
• In mountainous regions, during the day
the slopes get heated up and air moves
upslope and to fill the resulting gap the
air from the valley blows up the valley.
This wind is known as the valley breeze.
• During the night the slopes get cooled
and the dense air descends into the
valley as the mountain wind. The cool
air, of the high plateaus and ice fields
draining into the valley is
called katabatic wind.
Valley Breeze and Mountain Breeze
• Another type of warm wind
(katabatic wind) occurs on the
leeward side of the mountain
ranges.
• The moisture in these winds, while
crossing the mountain ranges
condense and precipitate.
• When it descends down the leeward
side of the slope the dry air gets
warmed up by adiabatic process.
This dry air may melt the snow in a
short time.
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Local differences of temperature and pressure produce local winds.
• Such winds are local in extent and are confined to the lowest levels of the
troposphere.
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Cold winds in Argentina and Uruguvay.
Pampero
• Hot, dry wind from Kalahari Desert to South
Berg Africa.
• Hot, dry dust storm in Sahara Desert ( Haboob Mainly Sudan and across Arabian Peninsula)
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Loo
 Harmful Wind
 In the plains of northern India and Pakistan,
sometimes a very hot and dry wind blows from the
west in the months of May and June, usually in the
afternoons. It is known as Its temperature invariably
ranges between 45°C and 50°C. It may
cause sunstroke to people
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
Khamsin • Hot, dry wind in Egypt.
Solano • Hot, moist wind for Sahara towards Iberian Peninsula
• Hot, dry wind blowing outwards from the interior of the
West Africa, also called Doctors Wind or Guinea Doctor Harmattan
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Foehn or Fohn
 Beneficial Wind
 Foehn is a hot wind of local importance in the Alps. It is a strong, gusty,
dry and warm wind which develops on the leeward side of a mountain
range.
 As the windward side takes away whatever moisture there is in the
incoming wind in the form of orographic precipitation, the air that
descends on the leeward side is dry and warm (Katabatic Wind).
 The temperature of the wind varies between 15°C and 20°C. The
wind helps animal grazing by melting snow and aids the ripening of
grapes.
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Chinook
 Beneficial Wind
 Foehn like winds in USA and Canada move down the west
slopes of the Rockies and are known as snow eaters
 It is beneficial to ranchers east of the Rockies as it keeps the
grasslands clear of snow during much of the winter.
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Mistral
 Harmful Wind
 Mistral is one of the local names given to such winds that blow from
the Alps over France towards the Mediterranean Sea.
 It is channeled through the Rhine valley. It is very cold and dry with a
high speed.
 It brings blizzards into southern France.
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Cold, dry wind blowing outwards from Hungary to the north Bora of Italy (near Adriatic Sea)
• Cold, dry wind blowing down owards the western side of Punas Andes.
Blizzard • Very cold winds in Tundra region
Santa Ana • Hot winds in Southern California in USA
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
Brickfielder • Hot wind in Australia
Purga • Cold winds in Russian Tundra
Levantar • Cold winds in Spain
Norwester • Hot winds in New Zealand
Tertiary Winds or Local Winds
• Sirocco
 Harmful Wind
 Sirocco is a Mediterranean wind that comes from
the Sahara and reaches hurricane speeds in North Africa
and Southern Europe.
Wind Measurement
• Winds come in all directions or speeds. They are measured by their
directions and speeds.
• Anemometers
• Anemometers measure the direction of winds.
• The Wind Vane
• Another instrument in wind measurement is the wind vane.
• Beaufort Wind Force Scale
• In 1805, a British Naval Officer invented this scale to measure wind
force. The scale has reading of 0 up to 12 to classify wind force.
Jet streams
• In westerlies, there are strong, narrow
bands of high speed winds and are
called Jet Streams.
• Speed of Jet Streams is around 300
Kmph.
• 4 Permanent Jet Streams : 2 polar jet
streams and 2 subtropical jet streams
Permanent jet streams
• There are two
permanent jet streamssubtropical jets at lower
latitudes and polar front
jets at mid-latitudes.
Subtropical jet stream (STJ)
• The sub-tropical jet stream is produced by
the earth’s rotation (Coriolis force) and
temperature contrast between tropical and
sub – tropical regions.
• At the equator, the rotation produces
greatest velocity in the atmosphere.
• As a result, the rising air which spreads out
northwards and southwards, moves faster
than the latitudes over which it is blowing.
Subtropical jet stream (STJ)
• It is deflected to the right in the northern
hemisphere and to the left in the southern
hemisphere, and at about 30° latitude, it becomes
concentrated as the subtropical jet streams.
• During winter, the STJ is nearly continuous in both
hemispheres. The STJ exists all year in the southern
hemisphere. However, it is intermittent in the
northern hemisphere during summer when it
migrates north.
• The STJ can be temporarily displaced when strong
mid-latitude troughs (ITCZ) extend into subtropical
latitudes. When these displacements occur, the
subtropical jet can merge with the polar front jet
Polar front jet (PFJ)
• The polar front jet is produced by a
temperature difference.
• It has a more variable position than the subtropical jet. In summer, its position shifts
towards the poles and in winter towards the
equator.
• The jet is strong and continuous in winter.
• It greatly influences climates of regions lying
close to 60 degree latitude.
Temporary jet streams
• There are also major high velocity winds in the lower
troposphere called low-level jets (LLJs).
• In the tropics, the most prominent of these are the Somali
Jet and the African Easterly Jet.
The Tropical Easterly Jet or African Easterly Jet
• The TEJ is found near between 5°
and 20°N.
• During the south Asian summer
monsoon, the TEJ induces secondary
circulations that enhance convection
over South India and nearby ocean
(around Madagacar/ Mascrene High)
• It is believed that the jet may be
caused by the uniquely high
temperatures and heights over the
Tibetan Plateau during summer.
• The TEJ is the upper-level venting
system for the strong southwest
monsoon.
The Somali Jet/ Findlater Jet Stream
• The Somali jet occurs during the
summer over northern Madagascar and
off the coast of Somalia. The jet is most
intense from June to August.
• It is a major cross-equatorial flow from
the southern Indian Ocean to the central
Arabian Sea.
• A split in the axis of the jet over the
Arabian Sea, the more northern branch
intersecting the west coast of India near
17°N, while the southerly branch moves
eastward just south of India.
Meandering
• When the temperature contrast is maximum,
jet stream flows in near straight path.
• But when temperature contrast reduces, the
jet stream starts to follow a meandering path.
• So meandering depends on temperature
contrast (temperature gradient).
• A meander is called peak or ridge if it is
towards poles and trough if it is towards
equator.
• Jet Streams embedde in westerlies (Rossby
Waves) at high lattitude, cause pressure
variablity.
• That’s why they are called travelling
depression.
Jet Streams and Weather in
Temperate Regions
• Polar jet has distinct peaks (ridges)
and troughs.
• Ridges occur where the warm air (at
high pressure) pushes against the
cold air.
• Troughs occur where cold air (at
lower pressure) drops into warm air.
• This condition occurs due to weak jet
stream which is weak due to lesser
temperature contrast between subtropics and temperate region.
Jet Streams and Weather in
Temperate Regions
• These ridges and troughs give rise to jet
streaks which are the main reason behind
cyclonic and anticyclonic weather conditions
at the surface.
• The winds leaving the jet streak are rapidly
diverging, creating a lower pressure at the
upper level (Tropopause) in the atmosphere.
The air below rapidly replaces the upper
outflowing winds. This in turn creates the low
pressure at the surface. This surface low
pressure creates conditions where the
surrounding surface winds rush inwards. The
Coriolis effect creates the cyclonic rotation
that is associated with depressions.
Jet Streams and Weather in
Temperate Regions
• The winds entering the jet streak are
rapidly converging, creating a high
pressure at the upper level
(Tropopause) in the atmosphere. This
convergence at upper troposphere
leads to divergence (high pressure) at
the surface (anticyclonic condition).
• The Coriolis effect creates the
anticyclonic rotation that is
associated with clear weather.

Women and Freedom
Struggle of India
By Dr Vipan Goyal

Women and Freedom Struggle of India
• Though women were actively engaged in the struggle for independence,
some of the women leaders took a stand that women’s organisations
should be away from party politics in 1930.
• They were concerned more with the social issues rather than the political
issues. They decided so as British government’s help was necessary for the
women’s organisations to bring about social changes in women’s position
through legislation and education.
• However, there were some women leaders who took a different stand and
aligned themselves with the national movement.
Major Organizations
• Spread of education in the 19th and early 20th centuries made many
women to be actively engage themselves in the social and political life of
India.
• The struggle for women’s rights and equality was viewed as an integral
part of the struggle for independence.
• Many women who participated in the freedom struggle were also active
on the issues concerning the rights of women.
• Ten women participated in the 1889 Bombay Session of the Indian
National Congress.
• In 1931, Indian National Congress proclaimed that equality between men
and women as one of the objectives in the Fundamental Resolution.
• Though, women’s movements entered a new phase with the arrival of Gandhi,
women were associated with the freedom struggle before the arrival of Gandhi.
• They actively took part in the Swadeshi movement in Bengal (1905-1911) and laso
in the Home Rule Movement.
• But the participation of large number of women began after the arrival of Gandhi.
• Non-Cooperation movement provided a special role to women.
• Women peasants were also actively involved in the rural satyagrahas of Bardoli
and Borsad.
• They also participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement and in the Quit India
Movement
Social reform movements
• Brahmo Samaj: It was founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1825 &
attempted to abolish restrictions and prejudices against women, which
included child marriage, polygamy, limited rights to inherit property.
Education was seen as the major factor to improve the position of women.
• Civil Marriage Act, 1872 was passed, which permitted inter-caste
marriage, legalized divorce and fixed 14 and 18 as the minimum age of
marriage for girls and boys respectively
• Raja Ram Mohan Roy played an important role in getting Sati abolished
• However radicals like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Jyotiba Phule and Lokhitwadi Gopal
Hari Deshmukh accused the caste system responsible for the subjugation of women in
society.
• Similar movements began in Islamic community as well. Begum of Bhopal, Syed Ahmad
Khan & Sheikh Abdullah in Aligarh and Karmat Hussain in Lucknow spearheaded a
movement to improve women’s education.
• Prarthana Samaj: It was founded by MG Ranade & RG Bhandarkar in 1867. Justice
Ranade criticized child marriage, polygamy, restriction on remarriage of widows and non
access to education.
• Arya Samaj: It was founded by Dayanand Saraswati in 1875. It advocated reform in the
caste system, compulsory education for men and women, prohibition of child marriage
by law, remarriage of child widows. It was opposed to divorce & widow remarriage in
general.
Attitude of Mahatma Gandhi
• According to Gandhi, women possess qualities of self-sacrifice and
tolerance and an ability to endure sufferings. Hence, Gandhian ideology
had significant impact on women’s movement.
• He proclaimed that “I am uncompromising in the matter of women’s
rights”.
• He also said: “Woman is the companion of man gifted with equal mental
capabilities.”
Attitude of Jawaharlal Nehru
• According to Nehru, without achieving economic freedom other aspects of
women’s equality cannot be realised.
• He wanted women to be trained in all human activities and was opposed
to the view that women’s education alone can bring desired changes in
the issues concerning women.
• He also believed that if struggle of women got isolated from the general
political, economic and social struggles then the women’s movement
would remain confined to the upper classes.
Forms of participation of women in
freedom struggle
• Women contributed to the freedom struggle in a number of ways.
• They picketed shops selling foreign goods, participated in political protests,
organised Prabhat Pheri (singing of patriotic songs) and provided food and shelter for
underground political activists.
• In 1930, women participated in large numbers in Gandhiji’s Dandi march. Thousands of
women got jailed for participating in various events during freedom struggle.
• There were some militant groups that were active in Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra as well
as in foreign countries.
• Some prominent Indian women who worked with revolutionaries include Bhikaji Cama,
Perm D S Captian, Sraladevi Choudhurani in Bengal, Sushila Devi and Durga Devi in
Punjab, Roopavati Jain in Delhi Kalpana Dutt and Kamal Dasguptain Calcutta, Lakshmi
Sahgal, in-charge of the Rani Jhansi Women’s regiment which was a part of the Indian
National Army founded by Subhas Chandra Bose
Issues Raised: Women’s suffrage
• Demand for women’s suffrage was raised for the first time in 1917.
• A memorandum signed by 23 women was presented to Montague and Chelmsford demanding
votes on the same terms as men.
• Other demands like education, training in skills, local self government, and social welfare were
also presented.
• A women’s deputation including Sarojini Naidu and Margaret Cousins put forwarded the
demand for female franchise to the Viceroy.
• The Indian National Congress at its Calcutta session in 1917 presided over by Annie Besant
supported the demand for female franchise.
• In 1918, the Southborough Franchise Committee toured the whole British India to gather
information. But initially it was reluctant to grant the right to vote to women as it was of the
view that Indian women were not ready for it.
•
• Subsequently, Travancore-Cochin, a princely state was the first to accord voting rights to
women in 1920.
• Madras became the first province to allow women to exercise their franchise in 1921. But
the franchise was extremely limited. Only those women who possessed qualifications of
wifehood, property and education were allowed to exercise their franchise.
• Women also began to become legislative councillors.
• In 1926, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya stood for the Madras Legislative Council elections
contesting from Mangalore but was defeated by a narrow margin.
• In 1927, Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy was the first woman to become legislator councillor in
Madras.
• The demand for female franchise was later changed as demand for adult franchise within
the national movement.
• In 1927 when the Simon Commission was appointed, second phase in the battle for female
enfranchisement started.
• Some members of All India Women’s Conference (AIWC) met the members of the Commission.
• AIWC submitted its demands to the Franchise Committee of the Second Round Table
Conference.
• The Franchise Committee of the Second Round Table Conference under the chairmanship Lord
Lothian rejected the demand of universal adult franchise.
• The Committee recommended that 2-5% of seats in provincial legislatures be given to women.
But AIWC rejected the idea of reserved seats.
• The Government of India Act, 1935 removed some of the previous qualifications and increased
the number of enfranchised women. All the women above 21 years of age and possessed the
qualification of property and education were given the right to vote. Only after independence
women got the unrestricted voting rights.
• The All India Women’s conference (AIWC) at the initiative of Margaret Cousins took up
the problem of women’s education.
• AIWC realized that purdah, child marriage, and other social customs were preventing
women from getting education.
• So it waged a vigorous campaign to rise the age of marriage for girls.
• This resulted in the passage of the Sarada Act in 1929.
• AIWC also demanded to reform Hindu laws to prohibit bigamy and to provide women
with the rights to divorce and inherit property.
• But such reforms were finally obtained after a delay with the passage of the Hindu Code
Bills in 1950s.
Women in the labour movement
• In 1917, Ahmedabad textile workers’ strike was led by Anasuya Sarabhai
and the Ahmedabad textile mill workers union was established.
• Several rominent women unionists and women workers were working for
the welfare of the labourers.
• Maniben Kara emerged as the socialist leader of railway workers.
• Similarly, Ushabai Dange and Parvati Bhore emerged as the Communist
leaders of textile workers.

WORK
• It is done only when a constant force applied on an object, causes
the object to move in the same direction as the force applied.
What is considered as work done:
• You pushed against the wall, Jumping continuously on the same
spot, Work can be calculated by
• Work done = force × displacement
• SI unit for work is JOULE(J).
WorK
• The work done by the force is defined as the product of magnitude
of force and distance through which particles moves.
• Work is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is joule and CGS unit is erg. 1
joule = 107 erg.
• Work done by a force is zero when
 Body is not displace actually, i.e. s = 0
 Body is displaced perpendicular to the direction of force i.e. θ =
90°.
Work done by a variable force
• If we throw a ball upward, work done against gravity is given by, W
= mgh
 where, m = mass of the body,
 g = acceleration due to gravity and
 h = height through which the ball is raised.
WORK
• The centripetal force acts on a body perpendicular to the direction
of motion. Therefore, work done by or against centripetal force in
circular motion is zero.
• If a coolie is carrying a load on his head and moving on a horizontal
platform, then work done by force of gravity is zero as displacement
is perpendicular to the direction of force of gravity.
Power
• The rate at which work is done is called Power.
• Power (P) = Work done/ time interval = W/t.
• The SI unit of Power is Watt.
• Or watt= joule/sec
• so 1wattsec = 1 joule or 1watthour = 3600 joules
• 1 kilowatt hour = 3.6 x 106 joule.
• The Power of machines is expressed in Horse power (HP).
• 1HP = 746 watt
ENERGY
• It is the ability to do work. The amount of energy possessed by a
body is equal to the amount of work it can do when its energy is
released.
• The SI unit of energy is Joule.
• Energy is a scalar quantity.
• Energy can be transformed into work and vice-versa with the help
of some mechanical device.
Types of Energies
• Energy is of different kinds:-
 Kinetic energy
 Potential energy
 Electric energy
 Chemical energy
 Solar energy
 Nuclear energy
KINETIC ENERGY
• The energy of a body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. It
depends upon mass and velocity.
K.E = ½ mv2
• Kinetic energy is directly proportional to both mass and square of
velocity.
 If mass gets double K.E. also doubles and
 If velocity doubles, then the kinetic energy becomes 4 times.
POTENTIAL ENERGY
• Potential energy is the energy possessed by an object by virtue of its
POSITION or CONDITION.
• P.E = mgh
• Two common kinds:
 Gravitational PE
 Elastic PE
• ELASTIC PE
 Energy that can be possessed by an object due to its CONDITION.
 example: spring
POTENTIAL ENERGY
• GRAVITATIONAL PE
 Energy that can be possessed by an object due to its POSITION. In
Physics, ground level is normally assumed to be at ZERO GPE. Any
object that is at ground level has ZERO GPE. If object is lifted a certain
height above ground, its GPE has increased.
 GPE = mass × gravitational × height above ground level = m × g × h
 Its unit is [J] ,([kg] [m/s2] [m])
POTENTIAL ENERGY
• Gravitational PE, Examples:
 You lifted your bags to the top of your table. What can you say about
the GPE of your bag? – Zero, increase, decrease
 Lift the same bag on the Moon. What happens to GPE? Zero, increase,
decrease
 Will the GPE be the same on Earth and Moon? Same, less on Moon,
more on Moon?
Einstein’s Mass-Energy Relation
• According to this relation, the mass can be transformed into energy
and vice-versa.
• When Δm mass is disappeared, then produced energy
• E= Δ𝑚𝑐 square
• where, c = speed of light in vacuum.
Conservative and Non-conservative forces
• Conservative forces are non-dissipative (reversible) forces like
gravitational force, electrostatic force etc.
• For the conservative forces, work done during a round trip is always
zero.
• Non-conservative forces are dissipative in nature like frictional
force, viscous force etc.
CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
• Energy can neither be created nor destroyed by chemical reaction.
It can only be transformed from one form to another.
• Energy always remain same or fixed in quantity!, But this sand can
change position, from the top to bottom and bottom to top.
• Likewise energy can change in form e.g. From K.E. to P.E.
• Conversion of energy is the term used to denote change in energy
from one form to another.
CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
• Examples
 Burning candle: Chemical to Heat, Light.
 Fuel: Chemical to Heat to KE to Electricity.
 Nuclear explosion: Nuclear to Heat, light.
 Spring: Elastic P.E. to K.E.
Changing energies from one form to other
 DYNAMO – Mechanical energy into Electrical energy
 CANDLE- Chemical energy into Light and Heat energy
 MICROPHONE- Sound energy into Electrical energy
 LOUD SPEAKER- Electrical energy into Sound energy
 SOLAR CELL – Solar energy into Electrical energy
 TUBE LIGHT – Electrical energy into Light energy
 ELECTRIC BULB – Electrical energy into Light and Heat energy.
 BATTERY- Chemical energy into Electrical energy
 ELECTRIC MOTOR – Electric energy into Mechanical energy
 SITAR- Mechanical energy into Sound energy.
Relation between Momentum and K.E.
• K.E. = P2/2m
• Where p= momentum= mv
• Clearly when momentum is doubled, K.E. becomes four times.
Collision
• Collision between two or more particles is the interaction for a very
short interval of time in which they apply relatively strong forces on
each other. For a collision, physical contact of two bodies is not
necessary.
• A collision, in which momentum of the system as well as kinetic
energy of the system remains conserved, is called an elastic
collision.
• In an elastic collision, all involved forces are conservative forces.
Collision
• A collision in which only momentum remains conserved but kinetic
energy of the system does not remain conserved, is called an
inelastic collision.
• If after collision two colliding bodies gets sticked with each other
and moves with a common velocity, then collision is said to be
perfectly inelastic.
• In perfectly inelastic collision, the loss of kinetic energy during
collision does not recover at all and two bodies stick together after
collision.
Gravitation
• Each and every massive body attracts each other by virtue of their masses.
This phenomenon is called gravitation.
Newton’s Law of Gravitation
• The gravitational force acting between two point objects is directly
proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to
the square of the distance between them.
• Gravitational force (F) = 𝐺𝑚1𝑚2 / 𝑟2
• where, G is universal gravitational constant. Its value is 6.67 × 10−11 𝑁 –
𝑚2 𝑘𝑔−2.
• Gravitational force is a central as well as conservative force.
Acceleration Due to Gravity of Earth
• The uniform acceleration produced in a freely falling body due to
the earth’s gravitational pull, is called acceleration due to gravity, g
= 𝐺𝑀/ 𝑅2
• where, M = mass of the earth, R = radius of the earth.
• The value of g changes slightly from place to place but its value near
the earth’s surface is 9.8 𝑚𝑠−2.
• Gravitational force is the weakest force in nature. It is 1036 times
smaller than electrostatic force and 1038 times smaller than
nuclear force.
Factors Affecting Acceleration due to Gravity
• Shape of Earth Earth is not completely spherical its radius at
equator is approximately 21 km greater than its radius at poles.
 The value of g is maximum at poles and minimum at equator.
 There is no effect of rotation of the earth at poles and maximum
at equator.
• Effect of Altitude Therefore, g decreases with altitude.
• Effect of Depth g decreases with depth and becomes zero at centre
of the earth.
Factors Affecting Acceleration due to Gravity
• Mass and Weight
 The mass of a body is the quantity of matter contained in it. It is
a scalar quantity and its SI unit is kg.
 Mass is measured by an ordinary equal arm balance.
 Mass of a body does not change from place to place and
remains constant.
 The weight of a body is the force with which it is attracted
towards the centre of the earth. Weight of a body (w) = mg
Factors Affecting Acceleration due to Gravity
• The centre of gravity of a body is that point at which the whole
weight of the body appears to act.
 The centre of gravity of a body can be inside the material of the
body or outside it.
 It is a vector quantity and its SI unit is newton (N). It is measured
by a spring balance.
 Weight of a body is not constant; it changes from place to place.
Factors Affecting Acceleration due to Gravity
• Weight of a Body in a Lift
• When lift is rest or in uniform motion The weight recorded in
spring balance (i.e. apparent weight) is equal to the real weight of
the body w = mg.
• When lift is accelerating upward The weight recorded in spring
balance is greater than then real weight of the body w’ = m(g + a)
• When lift is accelerating downward The weight recorded in spring
balance is smaller than the real weight of the body w’ = m(g – a).
Factors Affecting Acceleration due to Gravity
• When lift is falling freely under gravity The apparent weight of the
body
 w' = m (g – g) (∵ a = g)
 w’ = 0
 Therefore, bodies will experiences weightlessness.
• Weight of a Body at the Moon
 As mass and radius of moon is lesser than the earth, so the
force of gravity at the moon is also less than that of the earth.
It’s value at the moon’s surface is 1/ 6
Satellite
• A heavenly body revolving around a planet in an orbit is called a satellite.
Moon is a natural satellite of the earth. The satellite may be artificial.
• Moon is a natural satellite, while INSAT-B is an artificial satellite of Earth.
• The period of revolution of satellite revolving near the surface of earth is 1
hour 24 minutes (84 minutes).
• Geo-stationary satellite revolves around the Earth at a height 36000 km
(approx).
• Time period of rotation of geo-stationary satellite is 24 hours.
• The Earth rotates on its axis from West to East. This rotation makes the
Sun and the stars appear to be moving across the sky from East to West.
Satellites
Artificial satellites are of two types:
Geostationary Satellites
Polar Satellites
Geostationary Satellites
• It revolves around the earth in equatorial orbits which
is also called Geostationary or Geosynchronous orbit.
The time period of these satellites is 24 hour. Height:
35,786 km. Speed: approximately 3 km/s .
• While the geostationary orbit lies on the same plane as
the equator, the geosynchronous satellites has a
different inclination.
• Geo-stationary satellite is used to telecast. TV
programmees from one part of the world to another, in
weather forecasting, in predictions of floods and
droughts.
• Examples: Kalpana-1 and IRNSS(Indian Regional
Navigation Satellite System)
Polar Satellites
• These satellites revolve around the earth in
polar orbits at a height of approximately 800
km.
• Weather monitoring which is predicted on
the basis of information about moisture
present in air, atmospheric pressure etc,
obtained through a polar satellite.
• Polar Satellite Revolves around the earth in
polar orbit at a height of 800km (app.) Time
periods of these satellites is 84 min.
• Low Earth Orbit Satellites
• Examples: Hubble Space Telescope
• Height: mostly around 400km .
• Speed: usually around 7.5 km/s
• Time period: approximately 1.5 hours
• Uses: Map-making, Spy, Remote-sensing, Weather.
• Medium Earth Orbit:
• Examples: GPS/ Global Positioning System/ United States and GLONASS/ GLObal
NAvigation Satellite System/ Russia
• Height: mostly around 20,000km
• Speed: usually around 4.5 km/;s
• Time period: approximately 12 hours
• High Earth Orbit
• Example: Chandra X-Ray Observatory
• Height: above 36,000 km
• Speed: less than 3 km/s
• Time period: more than 24 hours
Time Period of a Satellite
• We are able to see a live telecast of cricket world cup match
or other programmee with the help of a communication
satellite which is a geostationary satellite. Launching vehicles
– PSLV & GSLV
• It is the time taken by a satellite to complete one revolution.
• If satellite is near the earth's surface, then T = 2π√𝑅/ 𝑔 ≈ 84.6 min.
• Centrifugal force on a satellite is equal to gravitational force.
Satellites close to earth run fast, and away from earth run
slow.
Escape Velocity
• Escape velocity: Escape velocity is that minimum velocity with
which a body should be projected from the surface of earth so as it
goes out of gravitational field of earth and never return to earth.
• Escape velocity is independent of the mass, shape and size of the
body and its direction of projection.
• Escape velocity is also called second cosmic velocity.
• For earth, escape velocity = 11.2 km/s.
• For moon, escape velocity = 2.4 km/s.
Orbital Velocity
• Orbital velocity of a satellite 𝑉0 = √𝑔𝑅 and escape velocity 𝑉𝑒 = √2𝑔𝑅 where R =
Radius of earth.
• i.e. 𝑉𝑒 = √2𝑉0 i.e. escape velocity is √2 times the orbital velocity.
• There if the orbital velocity of a satellite is increased to √2 times (increased by 41%),
the satellite will leave the orbit and escape.
• Orbital speed of a Satellite:
• 1) Orbital speed of a satellite is independent of its mass.
• 2) It depends upon the radius of orbit(height of satellite from the surface of earth)
• 3) Greater the radius of orbit, lesser will be the orbital speed.
• Period of revolution: Time taken by a satellite to complete one revolution in its orbit
• 1. it depends upon height of satellite from the surface of earth.
• 2. Greater the height, more will be the period of revolution.
Kepler’s Law of Planetary motion
• Kepler gave three laws regarding motion of the planets. They are:
 First Law- Also known as Law of Orbits. According to this law
“Each planet move in an elliptical orbit around the sun, the sun
being at one of the foci of the ellipse”.
 Second Law – According to this law “A line that connects a
planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This
law is also known as law of areas”.
 Third Law – It states that “the square of the period of any planet
is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit”.
